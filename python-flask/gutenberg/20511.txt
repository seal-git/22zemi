  Three children sliding on the ice
    Upon a summer's day,
  As it fell out, they all fell in--
    The rest they ran away.

  Now had these children been at home,
    Or sliding on dry ground,
  Ten thousand pounds to one penny,
    They had not all been drown'd.

  Ye parents who have children dear,
    And eke ye that have none,
  If you would keep them safe abroad,
    Pray keep them safe at home.

  "Will you walk into my parlor?" said the spider to the fly;
  "'Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy.
  The way into my parlor is up a winding stair;
  And I have many curious things to show you when you're there."

  "Oh, no, no," said the little fly; "to ask me is in vain;
  For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again."

  "I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;
  Will you rest upon my little bed?" said the spider to the fly.
  "There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin;
  And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!"
  "Oh, no, no," said the little fly; "for I've often heard it said,
  They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!"

  Said the cunning spider to the fly,--
  "Dear friend, what can I do
  To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?"

  "I thank you, gentle sir," she said, "for what you're pleased to say,
  And bidding you good-morning now, I'll call another day."

  The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,
  For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again;
  So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly,
  And set his table ready, to dine upon the fly.
  Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,--
  "Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with the pearl and silver wing;

  Your robes are green and purple, there's a crest upon your head!
  Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!"

  Alas! alas! how very soon this silly little fly,
  Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by.
  With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,
  Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, her green and purple hue,--
  Thinking only of her crested head--poor foolish thing! At last,
  Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast!
  He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,
  Within his little parlor,--but she ne'er came out again!

  And now, dear little children, who may this story read,
  To idle, silly, flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed;
  Unto an evil counsellor close heart and ear and eye,
  And take a lesson from this tale of the Spider and the Fly.

  Because they bit my finger so.

  There once were two cats of Kilkenny,
  Each thought there was one cat too many,
  So they fought and they fit,
  And they scratched and they bit,
  Till, excepting their nails
  And the tips of their tails,
  Instead of two cats, there weren't any.

    He carried it home
    To his old wife Joan,
  And bid a fire for to make, make, make,
    To roast the little duck,
    He had shot in the brook,
  And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake.

  There was an old woman
    And nothing she had;

    She'd nothing to fear,
  She'd nothing to ask,
    And nothing to give,
  And when she did die,
    She'd nothing to leave.


  I had a little husband, no bigger than my thumb;
  I put him in a pint-pot, and there I bid him drum.

  I bought a little horse, that galloped up and down;
  I saddled him and bridled him, and sent him out of town.

  I gave him some garters, to garter up his hose,
  And a little pocket handkerchief to wipe his pretty nose.

        With a rowley, powley, gammon and spinach.
  Heigho, says Anthony Rowley.

  So off he set with his opera hat,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  And on the road he met a rat,
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,"
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "Kind Mrs. Mousey for to see?"
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  When they came to the door at Mousey's hall,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  They gave a loud tap, and they gave a loud call,
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?"
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "Yes, kind sirs, and sitting to spin."
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Pray, Mrs. Mouse, now give us some beer,"
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "That Froggy and I am fond of good cheer."
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?"
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "But let it be something that's not very long."
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "A cold has made me as horse as a hog."
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  "Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  "I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  But while they were all a-merrymaking,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  A Cat and her kittens came tumbling in.
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  The kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  He took up his hat and he wished them good-night.
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  As Froggy was crossing it over a brook,
              Heigho, says Rowley;
  A lilywhite Duck came and gobbled him up.
        With a rowley, powley, etc.

  So here is an end of one, two three--
              Heigho, says Rowley,
  The Rat, the Mouse, and little Froggy.
        With a rowley, powley, etc.


  Ladies and gentlemen, come to supper,
  Hot boiled beans and very good butter.


  The North Wind doth blow,
  And we shall have snow,
  And what will poor Robin do then?

  He will hop to a barn,
  And to keep himself warm,
  Will hide his head under his wing,
                    Poor thing!

  There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,
  She went to market her eggs for to sell;
  She went to market all on a market day,
  And she fell asleep on the king's highway.

  By came a peddler, whose name was Stout,
  He cut her petticoats all round about;
  He cut her petticoats up to the knees,
  Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.

  "But if it be I, as I hope it be,
  I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;
  If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,
  And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail."

  Home went the little woman all in the dark,
  Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;
  He began to bark, so she began to cry,
  "Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I."

  When the little old woman first did wake,
  She began to shiver, and she began to shake;
  She began to wonder, and she began to cry,
  "Lauk a mercy on me, this can't be I!"


  I had four brothers over the sea.
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.
  And they each sent a present unto me,
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  The first sent a chicken, without any bones;
  The second sent a cherry, without any stones,
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  The third sent a book, which no man could read;
  The fourth sent a blanket, without any thread.
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  How could there be a chicken without any bones?
  How could there be a cherry without any stones?
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  How could there be a book which no man could read?
  How could there be a blanket without a thread?
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  When the chicken's in the egg-shell, there are no bones,
  When the cherry's in the blossom, there are no stones.
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  When the book's in ye press no man it can read;
  When the wool is on the sheep's back, there is no thread.
    Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
    Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.


  Sneeze on Monday, sneeze for danger;
  Sneeze on Tuesday, kiss a stranger;
  Sneeze on Wednesday, receive a letter;
  Sneeze on Thursday, something better;
  Sneeze on Friday, expect sorrow;
  Sneeze on Saturday, joy to-morrow.


  It costs little Gossip her income for shoes,
  To travel about and carry the news.

  Pease porridge hot,
  Pease porridge cold,
  Pease porridge in the pot nine days old.
  Some like it hot,
  Some like it cold,
  Some like it in the pot nine days old.

  And a clever scholar you will be.


  Three little kittens they lost their mittens,
  And they began to cry,
          "Oh! mammy dear,
          We sadly fear,
      Our mittens we have lost!"
  "What! lost your mittens,
  You naughty kittens,
      Then you shall have no pie."
          Miew, miew, miew, miew,
          Miew, miew, miew, miew.

  The three little kittens they found their mittens,
  And they began to cry.
          "Oh! mammy dear,
          See here, see here,
      Our mittens we have found."
  "What! found your mittens,
  You little kittens,
      Then you shall have some pie."
          Purr, purr, purr, purr,
          Purr, purr, purr, purr.

  The three little kittens put on their mittens,
  And soon ate up the pie;
          "Oh! mammy dear,
          We greatly fear,
      Our mittens we have soil'd."

  "What! soil'd your mittens,
  You naughty kittens!"
      Then they began to sigh,
          Miew, miew, miew, miew,
          Miew, miew, miew, miew.

  The three little kittens they washed their mittens,
  And hung them up to dry;
          "Oh! mammy dear,
          Look here, look here,
      Our mittens we have wash'd."
  "What! wash'd your mittens,
  You darling kittens!
      But I smell a rat close by!
          Hush! hush!" Miew, miew,
          Miew, miew, miew, miew.


  Old Mother Hubbard
  Went to the cupboard
    To get her poor Dog a bone;
  But when she came there
  The cupboard was bare,

  But when she came back

    To get him some beer,
  But when she came back
    The dog sat in a chair.

    For white wine and red,
  But when she came back
    He stood on his head.

  She went to the hatter's

  But when she came back
    He was reading the news.

  She went to the sempstress,

  But when she came back
    The dog was spinning.

  [Illustration]

  She went to the hosier's,
    To buy him some hose,
  But when she came back
    He was dress'd in his clothes.

  The Dame made a curtsey,
    The Dog made a bow;
  The Dame said "Your servant,"
    The Dog said "Bow wow!"

  This wonderful Dog
    Was Dame Hubbard's delight;
  He could sing, he could dance,
    He could read, he could write.

  She gave him rich dainties
    Whenever he fed,
  And erected a monument
    When he was dead.

  Little King Boggen he built a fine hall,
  Pie-crust and pastry-crust, that was the wall,
  The windows were made of black puddings and white,
  And slated with pancakes,--you ne'er saw the like.


  To market, to market, a gallop, a trot,
  To buy some meat to put in the pot;
  Five cents a quarter, ten cents a side,

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
