BY

JOHN M. LEGLER


In the course of taxonomic studies of the genus _Gopherus_ it was
found that specimens from north-central Mexico belong to an hitherto
unrecognized species, which is named and described below.


Gopherus flavomarginatus new species

    _Holotype._--U.S. National Museum 61253, adult; stuffed specimen
    with disassociated skull; 30 to 40 miles from Lerdo, Durango,
    Mexico; obtained by Dr. Elswood Chaffee, 1918.

    _Paratypes._--USNM 61254, adult, stuffed specimen with skull in
    place, other data the same as those for holotype; USNM 60976,
    adult, stuffed specimen with disassociated skull, Lerdo, Durango,
    Dr. Elswood Chaffee, May 1918; University of Illinois 42953-4,
    adults, two carapaces, Carrillo, Chihuahua, Pete S. Chrapliwy and
    Kenneth L. Williams, 1 August 1958; University of Kansas 39415,
    adult, carapace only, 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos, Coahuila,
    Robert W. Dickerman, 19 May 1954.

    _Diagnosis._--A large tortoise of the genus _Gopherus_, having a
    flat-topped, posteriorly-flared shell, carapacal laminae that are
    pale with contrasting dark centers (at least on the lateral margins
    of the carapace), intergular seam longer than interhumeral, obtuse
    gular projections, and a relatively wider skull than other Mexican
    representatives of the genus.

    _Description of species._--Ground color of carapace pale yellow to
    straw in smaller specimens, pale brown in larger specimens; in some
    specimens a slight indication of darker radial markings on
    carapace; epidermal areolae of carapace (if present) and first two
    or three zones of growth (around areolae) dark brown to black,
    their contrast with the ground color greater in smaller specimens;
    ground color of lateral marginals yellowish, much paler than
    remainder of carapace; black areolae of marginals contrasting
    sharply with ground color even in old individuals; plastron pale,
    approximately the same shade of yellow as lateral marginals, marked
    with sharply contrasting blotches of black or dark brown in younger
    specimens, becoming immaculate with age.

    Carapace low, evenly arched or slightly flat-topped in cross
    section, its height slightly more than 50 per cent of its length;
    top of carapace, between highest parts of first and fourth central
    laminae, more or less flat in profile; carapace flared, wider
    posteriorly than anteriorly; central laminae all broader than long,
    the first not (or but slightly) narrower posteriorly than
    anteriorly; plastron deeply notched behind, the inner margins of
    the notch straight, neither convex nor concave; gular projections
    truncate (not pronglike) having no notch or but a shallow notch
    between them; greatest combined width of gular laminae much greater
    than greatest length; interlaminal length of gular greater than
    that of humeral; one large axillary scute on each side,
    approximately rectangular but slightly wider below than above; one
    or two inguinal scutes on each side, the anterior roughly
    triangular and much larger than posterior.

    Anterior surface of antebrachium having enlarged, juxtaposed (or
    slightly imbricated), osteodermal scales arranged in seven to eight
    longitudinal rows, each scale yellowish with a black or dark brown
    center; scales on lateral edge of antebrachium, from fifth claw to
    elbow, ten in number and darker than other antebrachial scales; two
    enlarged black-tipped, yellow spurs on posterior surface of thigh,
    inner spur approximately half the size of outer. Head relatively
    wide, greatest width of skull slightly more than 80 per cent of
    condylobasilar length; width of head 1.3 to 1.7 times diameter of
    hind foot; scales on top of head large but irregularly arranged
    (see table 1 for measurements of type and paratypes).

    Duges (1888:146-147, and 1896:479) twice reported specimens of
    _Gopherus polyphemus_ from Chihuahua (see discussion of distribution);
    his description of two living examples (1888) agrees generally with
    the above description of _G. flavomarginatus_. He stated that the
    iris of his smaller specimen was yellow and the iris of a larger
    specimen brown.

    It will be most interesting to learn the color of juveniles of _G.
    flavomarginatus_. Considering the dark color of the epidermal
    areolae of adults, I would expect the color of hatchlings to be
    dark brown to nearly black, with each lamina acquiring paler
    borders as it grew, rather than acquiring darker borders as is
    usually the case in _G. berlandieri_ (personal observation),
    _agassizii_ (Miller, 1932:194, pl. 2; Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:165,
    figs. 9 and 10), and _polyphemus_ (personal observation).

1b--Lateral and ventral views of skull of holotype (× 1); 1c--Cross
section of paratype (USNM 60976) taken through middle of third central
lamina (× 2/5).]

    _Anomalies._--There is a high incidence of anomaly in the type
    series. Three of the specimens (USNM 60976, IU 42954, and KU 39415)
    have a supernumerary central lamina. All of the specimens from
    Durango are anomalous in regard to the marginal laminae. In the
    holotype the first marginals are small, approximately as wide as
    the small precentral. In the largest paratype (USNM 61254) the
    first and second marginals are fused to form a single large scute
    on each side. In the remaining Durangan paratype (USNM 60976) there
    are eleven normal marginals on each side but a supernumerary lamina
    occurs between the first and second marginal on the left and
    between the precentral and first marginal on the right side. The
    remaining three paratypes have the number of marginals that is
    normal for the genus.

    _Relationships._--_Gopherus flavomarginatus_ differs from all other
    species of the genus by its larger size and by having an intergular
    seam that is longer than the interhumeral seam. The possession of
    a single, rectangular axillary scale, wider below than above,
    also tends to distinguish _flavomarginatus_ from other living
    _Gopherus_; in the other species this scute (frequently paired in
    _berlandieri_) is generally triangular or at least pointed below.
    Femoral spurs are developed to varying degrees in the other species
    of _Gopherus_; they are usually lacking in individuals of small to
    medium size. In large specimens of _agassizii_ and _polyphemus_
    that I have examined, there is but one enlarged spur, although
    several pointed osteodermal scales may be present on the back of
    the thigh.

    _Gopherus berlandieri_, the closest relative of _G. flavomarginatus_
    in a geographic sense, has a highly arched shell and pronglike gular
    projections, between which there is nearly always a deep notch.
    _Gopherus agassizii_, morphologically the closest Mexican relative
    of _flavomarginatus_, differs from it in having a narrower head and
    in lacking the contrasting pale and dark coloration of the plastron
    and lateral marginal area. _Gopherus polyphemus_ seems to be the
    closest relative of _flavomarginatus_ and differs from it in having
    an unflared shell (anterior and posterior widths of carapace
    subequal or carapace narrower behind) and in the characteristics of
    color mentioned above. Certain proportional differences between the
    living species of _Gopherus_ are summarized in table 2.

    _Distribution._--The discovery of a new _Gopherus_ from
    north-central Mexico increases to four the recognized forms of the
    genus and extends the known range of the genus onto the Mexican
    highlands, approximately 410 miles eastward from Alamos, Sonora
    (_G. agassizii_), approximately 100 miles westward from a point 2
    mi. W of Monclova, Coahuila (_G. berlandieri_), and approximately
    200 miles westward from Monterrey, Nuevo León (_G. berlandieri_).

    Thus far, _G. flavomarginatus_ is known only from the three
    localities represented in the type series and from the indefinite
    locality, "Bolson de Mapimí", Chihuahua, given by Duges
    (1888:146-7, and 1896:479). These long-doubted references of
    Duges to _Gopherus polyphemus_ seem clearly to represent _G.
    flavomarginatus_, which probably occurs in several or all of the
    internally drained basins in northeastern Chihuahua, western
    Coahuila, and northern Durango. This region is within the Basin and
    Range physiographic province of Fenneman (1931:326-8) and the
    Mapimí biotic province of Smith (1949:231). Duges (_supra cit._)
    seems to have used "Bolson de Mapimí" in a restricted sense, as it
    is shown on some recent maps (Nat. Geog. Soc., Map of Mexico and
    Central America, 1953) (American Geog. Soc., Culican Map, NG 13,
    1935). Other maps show this bolson to include internally drained
    portions of the Mexican highlands from northeastern Chihuahua to
    the region near Lerdo and Torreon. Thayer (1916:73) pointed out
    that the Bolson de Mapimí, in its larger sense, consists of a
    series of basins separated by mountains of considerable elevation.

    The range of _G. flavomarginatus_ appears to be limited ultimately
    by the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the
    Sierra Madre Oriental to the west and east, respectively, and to
    the south by the Mexican plateau. The northern limits of the range
    are less clear; possibly the range extends as far as the portions
    of the United States adjacent to northeastern Chihuahua, but this
    is doubtful. The range seems not to overlap that of any other
    species of _Gopherus_, although the ranges of _G. flavomarginatus_
    and _G. berlandieri_ closely approximate each other in central
    Coahuila.

    In September, 1958, when I was collecting turtles near Cuatro
    Cienegas, Coahuila, I took the opportunity to query natives, as
    well as an American rancher, about the possible occurrence of
    tortoises in the area. Most persons had seen no tortoises in the
    area or said they had seen them only rarely. Several older men who
    had herded goats in the area all their lives said that tortoises
    (referred to as "Tortuga del Monte") were common on the other side
    of the Sierra de La Madera and Sierra de La Fragua ranges west of
    Cuatro Cienegas. These men referred probably to _G.
    flavomarginatus_. Americanos lies approximately 75 miles
    west-northwest of Cuatro Cienegas.

    It is indeed remarkable that a population of large tortoises in
    northern Mexico has so long escaped the notice of naturalists. Also
    remarkable is the fact that the late Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, in
    view of his intense interest in North American chelonians and his
    familiarity with the genus _Gopherus_, did not remark on the
    specimens from Durango when he saw them; a thorough search of
    Stejneger's notes revealed no clue that he had ever studied the
    specimens. Perhaps his first reaction to the specimens, like mine
    when I first examined the two disassociated skulls, was to consider
    "Lerdo" a misspelling of "Laredo." However, a check of old
    correspondence and accession records at the National Museum
    confirmed, beyond doubt, the validity of the locality data for
    these specimens. Dr. Chaffee, the collector, frequently sent
    specimens of plants and animals to the Museum from Durango and
    Zacatecas; his home was in Lerdo.

    _Size._--The largest specimen of _Gopherus flavomarginatus_ (USNM
    61254) exceeds by more than 50 millimeters the length of the
    largest known specimens of _G. agassizii_, and slightly exceeds the
    length of the largest specimen of _G. polyphemus_ that I have
    examined (USNM 51357, length of carapace 360 millimeters, a
    specimen formerly kept at the National Zoological Park). _G.
    polyphemus_ is the largest tortoise inhabiting the United States;
    the maximum length of 343 millimeters given for the species by Carr
    (1952:334) probably more closely approaches the true maximum in
    free-living populations. _G. agassizii_ rarely attains a length
    greater than 300 millimeters (Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:152-5). The
    fact that representatives of the genus do not attain a larger size
    in the United States may be due to the decimation of natural
    populations by man for food and souvenirs.

    There have been several indications that a large species of
    tortoise existed in north-central Mexico. The Chihuahuan specimens
    reported by Duges (248 and 202 millimeters long, respectively) rank
    in size with the smaller paratypes of _G. flavomarginatus_; Duges
    stated, however, that the species was said to attain a length of
    one meter but that he thought such large size surely to apply to
    another species.

    Mr. Charles M. Bogert recently related to me two stories that are
    here worthy of note. One of them, which Bogert learned from the
    late Dr. Karl P. Schmidt, concerns a collector who was sent by the
    Chicago Natural History Museum (then Field Museum) to Coahuila in
    the early part of the century to obtain materials for a desert
    exhibit. When the exhibit had been completed several decades later,
    the collector, visiting the museum, inquired as to where the large
    tortoises were that he had collected in Coahuila. Dr. Schmidt could
    find no record of such tortoises and suggested that possibly they
    had been confused with Galapagos tortoises (_Geochelone_). Dr.
    Robert F. Inger is unable to locate the specimens or add anything
    to the story. The collector stated that the large tortoises had
    been found in only one bolson in Coahuila.

    Mr. Bogert further related that, in 1946 when he was camped at Las
    Delicias, Coahuila, a Mexican mule herder told him of seeing a
    large tortoise "three bolsons north" of the bolson in which Las
    Delicias is located (the general area referred to would be near
    Americanos). The man awoke one morning to find his saddle missing;
    following tracks from the place where the saddle had been left, the
    man eventually found it on the back of a large tortoise. The
    tortoise had apparently sought shelter beneath the saddle and,
    finding it unsatisfactory, had walked away with the saddle on his
    back.

    Either of the incidents related above, or the reference of Duges
    (_loc. cit._) to large size, since they are based on second or
    third-hand accounts, would seem to be unrealistic and of little
    scientific value when considered alone and at face value. However,
    in the light of the discovery of _Gopherus flavomarginatus_, these
    accounts have new meaning and tend to support my proposal that the
    species is the largest tortoise in North America.

    _Remarks._--The paratypes at the University of Illinois were found
    in a trash-dump in Carrillo. According to what the collectors
    learned from local inhabitants, the species is used for food and
    the shells are sometimes used for poultry dishes or even for eating
    utensils. Although the species is found on the flat, sandy desert
    near Carrillo, it is more common on the nearby mountain slopes and
    is seen there most frequently after rains. Dickerman (field notes,
    1954) likewise noted that the species was eaten near Americanos;
    the K.U. paratype represents the best (and only specimen saved) of
    several broken shells found in that area. Judging by the habits of
    other members of the genus and by the notes of Duges (1888:147),
    _G. flavomarginatus_ is probably herbivorous.

    _Acknowledgments._--A portion of this study was completed in the
    summer of 1958, while I was an internee at the United States
    National Museum. I am grateful to Dr. Doris M. Cochran of that
    institution for helpful information regarding the origin of the
    type and for permission to study other specimens in her care.
    Thanks are due also to Messrs. Pete S. Chrapliwy and Kenneth L.
    Williams who collected two of the paratypes and who generously
    provided their notes on the specimens when learning of my study, to
    Dr. Hobart M. Smith and Mr. Charles M. Bogert for offering helpful
    suggestions and for the loan of specimens, and to Mr. Jebb Taylor
    for assistance with taking data. The drawings are the work of Mrs.
    Connie Spitz; the photographs are by the author.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
