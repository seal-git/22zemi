Aruba

Introduction

Aruba

Background:  Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired
by the Dutch in 1636.  The island's economy has been dominated by three
main industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity
brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last decades of
the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry. Aruba seceded from
the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a separate, autonomous member
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence
was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.

Economy Aruba

Economy - overview:  Tourism is the mainstay of the small, open Aruban
economy, with offshore banking and oil refining and storage also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction
has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. In addition,
the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source
of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred
growth. Aruba's small labor force and low unemployment rate have led
to a large number of unfilled job vacancies, despite sharp rises in
wage rates in recent years. The government's goal of balancing the
budget within two years will hamper expenditures, as will the decline
in stopover tourist arrivals following the 11 September terrorist attacks.

Economy Antigua and Barbuda

Economy - overview:  Tourism continues to dominate the economy, accounting
for more than half of GDP. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early
2000 have slowed the economy, however, and pressed the government into a
tight fiscal corner. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is
focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply
and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism
and construction work. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for
export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic
components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue
to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in
the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

Introduction

Afghanistan

Background:  Afghanistan's recent history is characterized by war
and civil strife, with intermittent periods of relative calm and
stability. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 but was forced to withdraw 10
years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the
US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued
among the various mujahidin factions, giving rise to a state of warlordism
that spawned the Taliban in the early 1990s. The Taliban was able to seize
most of the country, aside from Northern Alliance strongholds primarily
in the northeast, until US and allied military action in support of the
opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks forced the
group's downfall. The four largest Afghan opposition groups met in Bonn,
Germany, in late 2001 and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new
government structure that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid KARZAI
as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.
In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing
military action to root out remaining terrorists and Taliban elements,
the country suffers from enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure,
and widespread land mines.

Economy Afghanistan

Economy - overview:  Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). During
that conflict one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan
and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6 million refugees.
Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties
in 1998-2001. The majority of the population continues to suffer
from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care, problems
exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. Inflation
remains a serious problem. Following the US-led coalition war that led
to the defeat of the Taliban in November 2001 and the formulation of
the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) resulting from the December 2001 Bonn
Agreement, International efforts to rebuild Afghanistan were addressed at
the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002,
when $4.5 billion was collected for a trust fund to be administered
by the World Bank. Priority areas for reconstruction include the
construction of education, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement
of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector,
and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

Algeria

Introduction

Algeria

Background:  After a century of rule by France, Algeria became independent
in 1962. The surprising first round success of the fundamentalist FIS
(Islamic Salvation Front) party in the December 1991 balloting caused the
army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and postpone the subsequent
elections. The FIS response has resulted in a continuous low-grade
civil conflict with the secular state apparatus, which nonetheless has
allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based
parties. FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded itself
in January 2000 and many armed militants surrendered under an amnesty
program designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless,
residual fighting continues. Other concerns include Berber unrest,
large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, and the need to diversify
the petroleum-based economy.

Economy Algeria

Economy - overview:  The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP,
and over 95% of export earnings.  Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves
of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it
ranks 14th in oil reserves. Algeria's financial and economic indicators
improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported
by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club. Algeria's finances
in 2000 and 2001 benefited from the temporary spike in oil prices and
the government's tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the
trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in
foreign debt. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy
by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector
has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living
standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with
the European Union that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade.

Azerbaijan

Introduction

Azerbaijan

Background:  Azerbaijan - a nation of Turkic Muslims - has been
an independent republic since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. Despite a 1`994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its
conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh enclave
(largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has lost almost 20% of its
territory and must support some 750,000 refugees and internally displaced
persons as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous and the
promise of widespread wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum
resources remains largely unfulfilled.

Geography Azerbaijan

Location:  Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
and Russia

Geographic coordinates:  40 30 N, 47 30 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 86,600 sq km note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan
Autonomous Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy
was abolished by Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991 water:
Area - comparative:  slightly smaller than Maine

Land boundaries:  total: 2,013 km border countries: Armenia (with
Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave)
221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran
(with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km

Coastline:  0 km (landlocked); note - Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea
(800 km, est.)

Maritime claims:  none (landlocked)

Climate:  dry, semiarid steppe

Terrain:  large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of it
below sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag
Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi
(Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea

Environment - current issues:  local scientists consider the Abseron
Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the
Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world
because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution results
from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants used
in the production of cotton

Economy Azerbaijan

Economy - overview:  Azerbaijan's number one export is oil. Azerbaijan's
oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase
every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements
(PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to
oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur future
industrial development.  Oil production under the first of these PSAs,
with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November
1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet
republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects.
Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and
old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle
to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment in the
non-energy sector, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet
republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey
and the nations of Europe.  Long-term prospects will depend on world oil
prices, the location of new pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's
ability to manage its oil wealth.

Disputes - international:  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists
in Nagorno-Karabakh and militarily occupies almost one-fifth of
Azerbaijan - Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
continues to mediate dispute; Azerbaijan signed bilateral agreements
with Russia delimiting the Caspian seabed, but littoral states are far
from multilateral agreement on dividing the waters and seabed regimes
- Iran insists on division of Caspian Sea into five equal sectors
while Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan have generally
agreed upon equidistant seabed boundaries; Iran threatens to conduct oil
exploration in Azerbaijani-claimed waters, while interdicting Azerbaijani
activities; Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan await ICJ decision to resolve
sovereignty dispute over oilfields in the Caspian Sea

Albania

Introduction

Albania

Background:  In 1990 Albania ended 44 years of xenophobic communist
rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has
proven difficult as corrupt governments have tried to deal with high
unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread gangsterism,
and disruptive political opponents. International observers judged
local elections in 2001 to be acceptable and a step toward democratic
development, but identified serious deficiencies which should be addressed
through reforms in the Albanian electoral code.

Economy Albania

Economy - overview:  Poor and backward by European standards, Albania is
making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy. The
government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to revive economic
activity and trade.  The economy is bolstered by remittances from abroad
of $400-$600 million annually, mostly from Greece and Italy. Agriculture,
which accounts for 52% of GDP, is held back because of frequent drought
and the need to modernize equipment and consolidate small plots of
land. Severe energy shortages are forcing small firms out of business,
increasing unemployment, scaring off foreign investors, and spurring
inflation.

transit neighboring states to emigrate to western Europe

Illicit drugs:  increasingly active transshipment point for Southwest
Asian opiates, hashish, and cannabis transiting the Balkan route and -
to a far lesser extent - cocaine from South America destined for Western
Europe; limited opium and growing cannabis production; ethnic Albanian
narcotrafficking organizations active and rapidly expanding in Europe

Armenia

Introduction

Armenia

Background:  An Armenian Apostolic Christian country, Armenia was
incorporated into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in 1920. Armenian
leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began
fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both
countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By
May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not
only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan
proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability
to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.

scavenged for firewood; pollution of Hrazdan (Razdan) and Aras Rivers;
the draining of Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan), a result of its use as a source
for hydropower, threatens drinking water supplies; restart of Metsamor
nuclear power plant in spite of its location in a seismically-active zone

Economy Armenia

Economy - overview:  Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy.  Since the implosion of the
USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture
away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated
technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but
has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia
is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed
economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe
economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian
Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program
that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2001. Armenia also
managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized
enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent
years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its
nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has
been offset somewhat by international aid, domestic restructuring of
the economy, and foreign direct investment.

Economy Andorra

Economy - overview:  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do
economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists
visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer
and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded
as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have been opened up,
providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking
sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes substantially to
the economy. Agricultural production is limited - only 2% of the land
is arable - and most food has to be imported.  The principal livestock
activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of
cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra is a member of the EU Customs
Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods
(no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Angola

Introduction

Angola

Background:  Civil war has been the norm in Angola since independence
from Portugal in 1975. A 1994 peace accord between the government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) provided for
the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the government and armed

serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of
people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost in fighting

Economy Angola

Economy - overview:  Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter
century of nearly continuous warfare. Subsistence agriculture provides
the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the
supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45%
to GDP and 90% of exports. Violence continues, millions of land mines
remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As
a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. To fully
take advantage of its rich natural resources - gold, diamonds, extensive
forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need
to end its conflict and continue reforming government policies. Internal
strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector, which
is producing roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day. While Angola made
progress in bringing inflation down further, from over 300% in 2000 to
about 110% in 2001, the government has failed to make sufficient progress
on reforms recommended by the IMF, such as increasing foreign exchange
reserves and promoting greater transparency in government spending.
Angola's GDP could be among the world's fastest growing in 2002 if oil
production from the Girassol field, which began production in December
2001, reaches 200,000 barrels per day as expected.

American Samoa

Introduction

American Samoa

Background:  Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was "discovered"
by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in
the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in
which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally
occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the
excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Economy American Samoa

Economy - overview:  This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity
is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts
most of its foreign trade.  Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants
are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary
export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American
Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a
larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location,
its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism,
a developing sector, has been held back by the recurring financial
difficulties in East Asia.

Argentina

Introduction

Argentina

Background:  Following independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina
experienced periods of internal political conflict between conservatives
and liberals and between civilian and military factions. After World
War II, a long period of Peronist authoritarian rule and interference in
subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power
in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983, and numerous elections since then
have underscored Argentina's progress in democratic consolidation.

Economy Argentina

Economy - overview:  Argentina benefits from rich natural resources,
a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. However, when President Carlos MENEM
took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge external debts,
inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was plummeting. To
combat the economic crisis, the government embarked on a path of trade
liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. In 1991, it implemented
radical monetary reforms which pegged the peso to the US dollar and
limited the growth in the monetary base by law to the growth in reserves.
Inflation fell sharply in subsequent years. In 1995, the Mexican peso
crisis produced capital flight, the loss of banking system deposits,
and a severe, but short-lived, recession; a series of reforms to bolster
the domestic banking system followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly,
reaching 8% in 1997. In 1998, international financial turmoil caused by
Russia's problems and increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced
the highest domestic interest rates in more than three years, halving the
growth rate of the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP falling
by 3%. President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in December 1999,
sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, which
had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. Growth in 2000 was a negative
0.5%, as both domestic and foreign investors remained skeptical of the
government's ability to pay debts and maintain the peso's fixed exchange
rate with the US dollar. The economic situation worsened still further in
2001 with the widening of spreads on Argentine bonds, massive withdrawals
from the banks, and a further decline in consumer and investor confidence.
Government efforts to achieve a "zero deficit", to stabilize the banking
system, and to restore economic growth proved inadequate in the face
of the mounting economic problems. At the start of 2002, newly elected
president Eduardo DUHALDE met with IMF officials to secure an additional
$20 billion loan, but immediate action seemed unlikely. The peso's peg
to the dollar was abandoned in January 2002, and the peso was floated
from the dollar in February; inflation picked up rapidly.

Introduction

Australia

Background:  Australia became a commonwealth of the British Empire
in 1901. It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to
rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to
make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II.
Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone
layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the
Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's status, from a
commonwealth headed by the British monarch to an independent republic,
was defeated in 1999.

Economy Australia

Economy - overview:  Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist
economy, with a per capita GDP on par with the four dominant West European
economies. The Australian economy has been resilient in the face of
the global economic downturn in 2001 chalking up 2.3% GDP growth, as
the domestic economy is offsetting the external slump and business and
consumer confidence remains robust. Canberra's emphasis on reforms is
a key factor behind the economy's strength, and Australia is expected
to outperform its trading partners in 2002, with GDP growth projected
to be 3% or better. Australia probably will experience some weakness in
mid-2002 as its business cycle tends to lag the US by about six months,
and larger problems could emerge if Australia's trade position worsens.

Austria

Introduction

Austria

Background:  Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained
unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with
Germany. A constitutional law of that same year declared the country's
"perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. This
neutrality, once ingrained as part of the Austrian cultural identity,
has been called into question since the Soviet collapse of 1991 and
Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995. A prosperous country,
Austria entered the European Monetary Union in 1999.

Economy Austria

Economy - overview:  Austria, with its well-developed market economy
and high standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies,
especially Germany's.  Membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign
investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market
and proximity to EU aspirant economies. Slowing growth in Germany and
elsewhere in the world slowed the economy to only 1.2% growth in 2001;
the economy is expected to do little better in 2002. To meet increased
competition from both EU and Central European countries, Austria will
need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, continue to
deregulate the service sector, and lower its tax burden.

Anguilla

Introduction

Anguilla

Background:  Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century,
when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated
into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several
attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt,
Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally
recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency.

Economy Anguilla

Economy - overview:  Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy
depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing,
and remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism
industry, which has spurred the growth of the construction sector, has
contributed to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put substantial
effort into developing the offshore financial sector, which is small,
but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the economy will depend
largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on revived income growth
in the industrialized nations as well as on favorable weather conditions.

Antarctica

Introduction

Antarctica

Background:  Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was
not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial
operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring
the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic
Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a
continent and not just a group of islands. Several exploration "firsts"
were achieved in the early 20th century. Following World War II, there was
an upsurge in scientific research on the continent. A number of countries
have set up year-round research stations on Antarctica. Seven have made
territorial claims, but no other country recognizes these claims. In
order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the
continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor
gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it
entered into force in 1961.

Geography Antarctica

Location:  continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates:  90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references:  Antarctic Region

Area:  total: 14 million sq km note: fifth-largest continent, following
Asia, Africa, North America, and South America, but larger than Australia
and the subcontinent of Europe land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km
ice-free, 13.72 million sq km ice-covered) (est.)

Area - comparative:  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries:  0 km note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline:  17,968 km

Maritime claims:  none; 20 of 27 Antarctic consultative nations have made
no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the US have reserved
the right to do so) and do not recognize the claims of the other nations;
also see the Disputes - international entry

Climate:  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica
because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate
climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average
slightly below freezing

Terrain:  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with
average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to
nearly 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern
Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of
Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half
of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area
of the continent

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,555 m
highest point: Vinson Massif 4,897 m note: the lowest known land point
in Antarctica is hidden in the Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface
is the deepest ice yet discovered and the world's lowest elevation not
under seawater

Natural resources:  iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum
and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small
uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited; krill, finfish,
and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries

Land use:  arable land: 0% permanent crops: 0% other: 100% (ice 98%,
barren rock 2%) (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  0 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau;
cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast;
volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other
seismic activity rare and weak; large icebergs may calve from ice shelf

Environment - current issues:  in 1998, NASA satellite data showed
that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of icefish,
an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was shown
to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants; in 2002, significant areas
of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming

Geography - note:  the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and driest
continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at
the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period;
mostly uninhabitable

People Antarctica

Population:  no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally staffed
research stations note: approximately 27 nations, all signatory to
the Antarctic Treaty, send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and
year-round research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the
population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and
its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered
by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to
1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel including
ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research are present in the
waters of the treaty region; summer (January) population - 3,687 total;

Government type:  Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic Treaty,
signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,
establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica. The
24th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was held in Russia in
July 2001. At the end of 2001, there were 45 treaty member nations:
27 consultative and 18 non-consultative. Consultative (voting) members
include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national
territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant nations. The US and
Russia have reserved the right to make claims. The US does not recognize
the claims of others. Antarctica is administered through meetings of the
consultative member nations. Decisions from these meetings are carried out
by these member nations (within their areas) in accordance with their own
national laws. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation
was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates
the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are

Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains
unratified; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998;
this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through five specific annexes: 1) marine pollution, 2) fauna and flora,
3) environmental impact assessments, 4) waste management, and 5) protected
area management; it prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources
except scientific research.

Legal system:  Antarctica is administered through meetings of the
consultative member nations.  Decisions from these meetings are carried
out by these member nations (within their areas) in accordance with their
own national laws. US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply extra-territorially. Some
US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic
Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and
criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized
by regulation of statute:  plants and animals; entry into specially
protected areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the
importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation
of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000
in fines and one year in prison. The National Science Foundation and
Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law
95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in 1996,
requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance,
the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation, Arlington,
Virginia 22230; telephone: Economy Antarctica

Economy - overview:  Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based abroad,
account for the limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01
(1 July-30 June) reported landing 112,934 metric tons. Unregulated fishing
probably landed more fish than the regulated fishery, and allegedly
illegal fishing in antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by
France and Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. The Convention
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources determines the
recommended catch limits for marine species. A total of 12,248 tourists
visited in the 2000-01 antarctic summer, down from the 14,762 who visited
the previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 21 commercial
(nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that made trips during the
summer. Most tourist trips lasted approximately two weeks.

Ports and harbors:  there are no developed ports and harbors in
Antarctica; most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and
supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges,
and helicopters; a few stations have a basic wharf facility; US coastal
stations include McMurdo (77 51 S, 166 40 E), Palmer (64 43 S, 64 03 W);
government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under "Legal
System"); all ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with
Article 7, Antarctic Treaty; offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent

Airports:  30 (2001) note: 27 stations, operated by 16 national
governments party to the Antarctic Treaty, have aircraft landing
facilities for either helicopters and/or fixed-wing aircraft; commercial
enterprises operate two additional aircraft landing facilities; helicopter
pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel,
sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled,
fixed-wing aircraft; of these, 1 is greater than 3 km in length, 6 are
between 2 km and 3 km in length, 3 are between 1 km and 2 km in length,
3 are less than 1 km in length, and 2 are of unknown length; snow
surface skiways, limited to use by ski-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft,
are available at another 15 locations; of these, 4 are greater than 3 km
in length, 3 are between 2 km and 3 km in length, 2 are between 1 km and 2
km in length, 2 are less than 1 km in length, and 4 are of unknown length;
aircraft landing facilities generally subject to severe restrictions and
limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions;
aircraft landing facilities do not meet ICAO standards; advance approval
from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization
required for landing; landed aircraft are subject to inspection in
accordance with Article 7, Antarctic Treaty

Heliports:  27 stations have helicopter landing facilities (helipads)
(2001)

Military Antarctica

Military - note:  the Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of
a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and
fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of
any type of weapon; it permits the use of military personnel or equipment
for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes

Transnational Issues Antarctica

Disputes - international:  Antarctic Treaty freezes claims (see Antarctic
Treaty Summary in Government type entry); sections (some overlapping)
claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, NZ, Norway, and UK;
the US and most other states do not recognize the territorial claims
of other states and have made no claims themselves (the US and Russia
reserve the right to do so); no claims have been made in the sector
between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west; several states with land
claims in Antarctica have expressed their intention to submit data to
the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend their
continental shelf claims to adjoining undersea ridges

Bahrain

Introduction

Bahrain

Background:  Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf
countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs
among its larger neighbors. Possessing minimal oil reserves, Bahrain has
turned to petroleum processing and refining, and has transformed itself
into an international banking center. The new amir is pushing economic
and political reforms, and has worked to improve relations with the Shi'a
community. In February 2001, Bahraini voters approved a referendum on
the National Action Charter - the centerpiece of the amir's political
liberalization program.

in the Gulf.  Bahrain is dependent on Saudi Arabia for oil revenue granted
as aid. A large share of exports consists of petroleum products made from
refining imported crude. Construction proceeds on several major industrial
projects. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of
oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems.

Economy Barbados

Economy - overview:  Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but production
in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. Offshore
finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners,
and there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues
its efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage direct foreign investment,
and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The economy contracted
in 2001 due to slowdowns in tourism and consumer spending. Growth will
remain anemic in 2002 with a recovery likely near the end of the year.

Economy Botswana

Economy - overview:  Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest
growth rates since independence in 1966. Through fiscal discipline and
sound management, Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest
countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of
$7,800 in 2001. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best
credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of expansion and
currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP and for four-fifths
of export earnings. Tourism, subsistence farming, and cattle raising
are other key sectors. On the downside, the government must deal with
high rates of unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially is 21%,
but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. HIV/AIDS infection
rates are the highest in the world and threaten Botswana's impressive
economic gains.

successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence was
soundly defeated in 1995.

Economy Bermuda

Economy - overview:  Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
incomes in the world, with its economy primarily based on providing
financial services for international business and luxury facilities for
tourists. The effects of 11 September 2001 have had both positive and
negative ramifications for Bermuda. On the positive side, a number of
new reinsurance companies have located on the island, contributing to
the expansion of an already robust international business sector. On
the negative side, Bermuda's already weakening tourism industry - which
derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - has been further hit as
American tourists have chosen not to travel. Most capital equipment
and food must be imported, with the US serving as the primary source
of goods, followed by the UK. Bermuda's industrial sector is small,
although construction continues to be important. Agriculture is limited,
only 6% of the land being arable.

Belgium

Introduction

Belgium

Background:  Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830
and was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. It has prospered
in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European
state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions between the Dutch-speaking
Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have
led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions
formal recognition and autonomy.

Economy Belgium

Economy - overview:  This modern private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed transport
network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is
concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With few
natural resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw
materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its economy
unusually dependent on the state of world markets. About three-quarters of
its trade is with other EU countries. Belgium's public debt is expected
to fall to about 100% of GDP in 2002, and the government has succeeded
in balancing its budget. Belgium, together with 11 of its EU partners,
began circulating euro currency in January 2002.  Economic growth in
2001 dropped sharply due to the global economic slowdown. Prospects for
2002 depend largely on recovery in the EU and the US.

Economy Bahamas, The

Economy - overview:  The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with
an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
alone accounts for more than 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly
employs almost half of the archipelago's labor force. Steady growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and
residences have led to solid GDP growth in recent years. Manufacturing
and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP
and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those
sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on
the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US,
the source of the majority of tourist visitors.

Bangladesh

Introduction

Bangladesh

Background:  Bangladesh came into existence in 1971 when Bengali East
Pakistan seceded from its union with West Pakistan. About a third of this
extremely poor country floods annually during the monsoon rainy season,
hampering economic development.

Geography Bangladesh

Location:  Southern Asia, bordering the Bay of Bengal, between Burma
and India

Geographic coordinates:  24 00 N, 90 00 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 144,000 sq km land: 133,910 sq km water: 10,090 sq km

Area - comparative:  slightly smaller than Iowa

Land boundaries:  total: 4,246 km border countries: Burma 193 km, India
4,053 km

Coastline:  580 km

Maritime claims:  contiguous zone: 18 NM territorial sea: 12 NM
continental shelf: up to the outer limits of the continental margin
exclusive economic zone: 200 NM

Climate:  tropical; mild winter (October to March); hot, humid summer
(March to June); humid, warm rainy monsoon (June to October)

Terrain:  mostly flat alluvial plain; hilly in southeast

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m highest point:
Keokradong 1,230 m

Natural resources:  natural gas, arable land, timber, coal

Land use:  arable land: 61% permanent crops: 3% other: 36% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  38,440 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  droughts, cyclones; much of the country routinely
inundated during the summer monsoon season

Environment - current issues:  many people are landless and forced to
live on and cultivate flood-prone land; water-borne diseases prevalent
in surface water; water pollution, especially of fishing areas, results
from the use of commercial pesticides; ground water contaminated by
naturally occurring arsenic; intermittent water shortages because of
falling water tables in the northern and central parts of the country;
soil degradation and erosion; deforestation; severe overpopulation

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Biodiversity, Climate
Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered
Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea,
Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands signed, but not
ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography - note:  most of the country is situated on deltas of large
rivers flowing from the Himalayas: the Ganges unites with the Jamuna
(main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually
empty into the Bay of Bengal

Economy Bangladesh

Economy - overview:  Despite sustained domestic and international efforts
to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains a
poor, overpopulated, and ill-governed nation. Although more than half
of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of
Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the
single most important product. Major impediments to growth include
frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises,
inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural
gas), insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic
reforms. Economic reform is stalled in many instances by political
infighting and corruption at all levels of government. Progress also has
been blocked by opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions,
and other vested interest groups. The newly-elected BNP government,
led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has the parliamentary strength to
push through needed reforms, but the party's level of political will to
do so remains undetermined.

Economy Belize

Economy - overview:  The small, essentially private enterprise economy is
based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and merchandising,
with tourism and construction assuming greater importance. Sugar,
the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of exports, while the banana
industry is the country's largest employer. The government's expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP
growth of 6.4% in 1999 and 10.5% in 2000. Growth decelerated in 2001 to
3% due to the global slowdown and severe hurricane damage to agriculture,
fishing, and tourism. Major concerns continue to be the rapidly expanding
trade deficit and foreign debt. A key short-term objective remains the
reduction of poverty with the help of international donors.

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Introduction

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Background:  Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty
in October 1991, was followed by a declaration of independence from
the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted
by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia
and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning
the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a
"greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number
of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a
joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November
1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties signed a peace agreement
that brought to a halt the three years of interethnic civil strife (the
final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton
Agreement retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and
created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national
government was charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal
policy.  Also recognized was a second tier of government comprised of two
entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation
and RS governments were charged with overseeing internal functions. In
1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000
troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of
the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR remains
in place at the January 2002 level of approximately 18,000 troops,
though further reductions may take place later in the year.

Government - note:  The Dayton Agreement, signed in Paris on 14 December
1995, retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's exterior border and created a
joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government -
based on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the
former socialist regime - is charged with conducting foreign, economic,
and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized a second tier of
government, comprised of two entities - a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS)
- each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The Federation
and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal functions. The
Bosniak/Croat Federation is further divided into 10 cantons. The Dayton
Agreement established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to
oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About
250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

Economy Bosnia and Herzegovina

Economy - overview:  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation.  Although agriculture is almost all in private
hands, farms are small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
is a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly overstaffed,
one reflection of the socialist economic structure of Yugoslavia. TITO
had pushed the development of military industries in the republic with
the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense
plants. The bitter interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production
to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995, unemployment to soar, and human
misery to multiply. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered
in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth
slowed in 2000 and 2001. GDP remains far below the 1990 level. Economic
data are of limited use because, although both entities issue figures,
national-level statistics are limited. Moreover, official data do not
capture the large share of activity that occurs on the black market. The
marka - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is now pegged to the
euro, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina has dramatically
increased its reserve holdings. Implementation of privatization, however,
has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level
institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the communist-era
payments bureaus were shut down. The country receives substantial amounts
of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international
community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

Introduction

Bolivia

Background:  Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and counter-coups. Comparatively
democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s, but leaders have
faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
drug production. Current goals include attracting foreign investment,
strengthening the educational system, continuing the privatization
program, and waging an anticorruption campaign.

Economy Bolivia

Economy - overview:  Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries, has made considerable progress
toward the development of a market-oriented economy. Successes under
President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-97) included the signing of a free
trade agreement with Mexico and becoming an associate member of the
Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur), as well as the privatization of
the state airline, telephone company, railroad, electric power company,
and oil company. Growth slowed in 1999, in part due to tight government
budget policies, which limited needed appropriations for anti-poverty
programs, and the fallout from the Asian financial crisis. In 2000, major
civil disturbances in April, and again in September and October, held
down overall growth to 2.5%. Bolivia's GDP failed to grow in 2001 due to
the global slowdown and laggard domestic activity. Growth is expected to
pick up in 2002, but the fiscal deficit and debt burden will remain high.

Economy Burma

Economy - overview:  Burma is a resource-rich country that suffers from
abject rural poverty. The military regime took steps in the early 1990s to
liberalize the economy after decades of failure under the "Burmese Way to
Socialism", but those efforts have since stalled. Burma has been unable
to achieve monetary or fiscal stability, resulting in an economy that
suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including an official
exchange rate that overvalues the Burmese kyat by more than 100 times
the market rate. In addition, most overseas development assistance
ceased after the junta suppressed the democracy movement in 1988 and
subsequently ignored the results of the 1990 election. Burma is data
poor, and official statistics are often dated and inaccurate. Published
estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated because of
the size of the black market and border trade - often estimated to be
one to two times the official economy.

drug trafficking in cross-border region; Burmese attempts to construct a
dam on border stream with Bangladesh in 2001 prompted an armed response
halting construction; Burmese Muslim migration into Bangladesh strains
Bangladesh's meager resources

Illicit drugs:  world's largest producer of illicit opium, surpassing
Afghanistan (potential production in 2001 - 865 metric tons, down 21%
due to drought, and to a lesser extent, eradication; cultivation in 2002
- 105,000 hectares, a 3% decline from 2000); surrender of drug warlord
KHUN SA's Mong Tai Army in January 1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major
counternarcotics success, but lack of government will and ability to take
on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against
money laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major
source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption

Economy Benin

Economy - overview:  The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output averaged a stable 5% in the past five years,
but rapid population rise offset much of this increase. Inflation has
subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth still
further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more
emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing
systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and
communication technology. The 2001 privatization policy should continue
in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture in spite of
initial government reluctance. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors
have eased the external debt situation.

Economy Belarus

Economy - overview:  Belarus has seen little structural reform since
1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
"market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed
administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
enterprise. In addition to the burdens imposed by high inflation and
persistent trade deficits, businesses have been subject to pressure on
the part of central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in
regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive application of
new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive" businessmen and
factory owners. Close relations with Russia, possibly leading to reunion,
color the pattern of economic developments. For the time being, Belarus
remains self-isolated from the West and its open-market economies.

digital metropolitan network and a cellular NMT-450 network; waiting
lists for telephones are long; local service outside Minsk is neglected
and poor; intercity - Belarus has a partly developed fiber-optic backbone
system presently serving at least 13 major cities (1998); Belarus's fiber
optics form synchronous digital hierarchy rings through other countries'
systems; an inadequate analog system remains operational international:
Belarus is a member of the Trans-European Line (TEL), Trans-Asia-Europe
(TAE) fiber-optic line, and has access to the Trans-Siberia Line (TSL);

Introduction

Solomon Islands

Background:  The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands
in the 1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred
on these islands.  Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence
two years later. Ethnic violence, government malfeasance, and endemic
crime have undermined stability and civil society.

Economy Solomon Islands

Economy - overview:  The bulk of the population depends on agriculture,
fishing, and forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Most
manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The islands
are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel,
and gold.  However, severe ethnic violence, the closing of key business
enterprises, and an empty government treasury have led to serious
economic disarray, indeed near collapse. Tanker deliveries of crucial
fuel supplies (including those for electrical generation) have become
sporadic due to the government's inability to pay and attacks against
ships. Telecommunications are threatened by the nonpayment of bills and
by the lack of technical and maintenance staff many of whom have left
the country.

Navassa Island

Introduction

Navassa Island

Background:  This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857 for
its guano, and mining took place between 1865 and 1898. The lighthouse,
built in 1917, was shut down in 1996 and administration of Navassa Island
transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department of the Interior. A 1998
scientific expedition to the island described it as a unique preserve
of Caribbean biodiversity; the following year it became a National
Wildlife Refuge.

Brazil

Introduction

Brazil

Background:  Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal,
Brazil became an independent nation in 1822. By far the largest and most
populous country in South America, Brazil has overcome more than half
a century of military intervention in the governance of the country to
pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of the interior.
Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, Brazil became
South America's leading economic power by the 1970s. Highly unequal
income distribution remains a pressing problem.

Geography Brazil

Location:  Eastern South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

Geographic coordinates:  10 00 S, 55 00 W

economic zone: 200 NM

Climate:  mostly tropical, but temperate in south

Terrain:  mostly flat to rolling lowlands in north; some plains, hills,
mountains, and narrow coastal belt

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m highest point:
Pico da Neblina 3,014 m

Natural resources:  bauxite, gold, iron ore, manganese, nickel,
phosphates, platinum, tin, uranium, petroleum, hydropower, timber

Land use:  arable land: 6% permanent crops: 2% other: 92% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  26,560 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  recurring droughts in northeast; floods and occasional
frost in south

Environment - current issues:  deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys the
habitat and endangers a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous
to the area; there is a lucrative illegal wildlife trade; air and water
pollution in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and several other large cities;
land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities;
wetland degradation; severe oil spills

is close to the implied underenumeration of 4.6% for the 1991 census;
estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of
excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy,
higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth
rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than
would otherwise be expected (July 2002 est.)

Economy Brazil

Economy - overview:  Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its presence
in world markets.  The maintenance of large current account deficits via
capital account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk
averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian financial
crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting
a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform,
Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international support program in
November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that
the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation
helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors
had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998, and the country
posted moderate GDP growth. Economic growth slowed considerably in 2001
- to less than 2% - because of a slowdown in major markets and the
hiking of interest rates by the Central Bank to combat inflationary
pressures. Investor confidence was strong at yearend 2001, in part
because of the strong recovery in the trade balance.

Bhutan

Introduction

Bhutan

Background:  In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu,
under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding
some border land.  Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907;
three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to
interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to
direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India
after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the
areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies
the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense
and foreign relations. A refugee issue of some 100,000 Bhutanese in
Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven United
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. Maoist
Assamese separatists from India, who have established themselves in the
southeast portion of Bhutan, have drawn Indian cross-border incursions.

Economy Bhutan

Economy - overview:  The economy, one of the world's smallest and
least developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, providing
the main livelihood for more than 90% of the population. Agriculture
consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged
mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage
industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely
on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction
for tourists are key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some
progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social
welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each
economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect
the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed controls
and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing, trade, labor,
and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.  Major hydroelectric
projects will lead expansion of GDP in 2002 by an estimated 6%.

Bulgaria

Introduction

Bulgaria

Background:  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with
the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the
Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of
the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks.  Bulgaria
regained its independence in 1878, but having fought on the losing side
in both World Wars, it fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and
became a People's Republic in 1946.  Communist domination ended in 1990,
when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and
began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and
a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime.  Today, reforms and democratization keep Bulgaria on a path
toward eventual integration into NATO and the EU - with which it began
accession negotiations in 2000.

Economy Bulgaria

Economy - overview:  Bulgaria, a former communist country striving to
enter the European Union, has experienced macroeconomic stability and
positive growth rates since a major economic downturn in 1996 led to the
fall of the then socialist government. The current government, elected in
2001, has pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives
of its predecessor, i.e., retaining the Currency Board, practicing sound
financial policies, accelerating privatization, and pursuing structural
reforms. A $300 million stand-by agreement negotiated with the IMF at
the end of 2001 will help the government maintain economic stability as
it seeks to overcome high rates of poverty and unemployment.

Bouvet Island

Introduction

Bouvet Island

Background:  This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered
by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by a
French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was made
until 1825 when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its
claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous
year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were
designated a nature reserve. Since 1977, Norway has run an automated
meteorological station on the island.

Brunei

Introduction

Brunei

Background:  The Sultanate of Brunei's heyday occurred between the
15th and 17th centuries, when its control extended over coastal areas
of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently
entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888,
Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was achieved in 1984.
Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields, the
source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the less developed
countries. The same family has now ruled Brunei for over six centuries.

Economy Brunei

Economy - overview:  This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of foreign
and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation, welfare measures,
and village tradition.  Crude oil and natural gas production account for
nearly half of GDP. Per capita GDP is far above most other Third World
countries, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements
income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical
services and subsidizes rice and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned
that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine
internal social cohesion although it became a more prominent player by
serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation)
forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the labor force, reducing
unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist sectors, and, in
general, further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.

Introduction

Burundi

Background:  Burundi's first democratically elected president was
assassinated in October 1993 after only four months in office. Since
then, some 200,000 Burundians have perished in widespread, often
intense ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Hundreds
of thousands have been internally displaced or have become refugees
in neighboring countries. Burundian troops, seeking to secure their
borders, intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in 1998. More recently, many of these troops have been redeployed
back to Burundi to deal with periodic upsurges in rebel activity. A new
transitional government, inaugurated on 1 November 2001, was to be the
first step towards holding national elections in three years. However,
the unwillingness of the Hutu rebels to enact a cease fire with Bujumbura
continues to obstruct prospects for a sustainable peace.

Economy Burundi

Economy - overview:  Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with
an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on subsistence
agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which
accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for
imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the climate and
the international coffee market. Since October 1993 the nation has
suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the
death of more than 200,000 persons and the displacement of about 800,000
others. Only one in four children go to school, and more than one in ten
adults has HIV/AIDS. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short
supply. Doubts regarding the sustainability of peace continue to impede
development. A Geneva donors' conference in November 2001 brought $800
million in pledges, and an IMF-staff-monitored program could lead to a
further agreement in 2002.

Canada

Introduction

Canada

Background:  A land of vast distances and rich natural resources,
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties
to the British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has
developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an
unfortified border. Its paramount political problem continues to be
the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its French-speaking
residents and unique culture, to the remainder of the country.

Geography Canada

Location:  Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean
on the east, North Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Arctic Ocean on
the north, north of the conterminous US

Geographic coordinates:  60 00 N, 95 00 W

Map references:  North America

Area:  total: 9,976,140 sq km land: 9,220,970 sq km water: 755,170 sq km

Land use:  arable land: 5% permanent crops: 0% other: 95% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  7,200 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle
to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a
result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North
American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east
of the mountains

Environment - current issues:  air pollution and resulting acid
rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; metal smelting,
coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural
and forest productivity; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to
agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities

Economy Canada

Economy - overview:  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World
War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into
one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
(which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and
economic integration with the US. As a result of the close cross-border
relationship, the economic downturn in the United States in 2001
had a negative impact on the Canadian economy. Real growth averaged
nearly 3% during 1993-2000, but declined in 2001. Unemployment is up,
with contraction in the manufacturing and natural resource sectors.
Nevertheless, with its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
and modern capital plant Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Two
shadows loom, the first being the continuing constitutional impasse
between English- and French-speaking areas, which has been raising the
possibility of a split in the federation. Another long-term concern is the
flow south to the US of professionals lured by higher pay, lower taxes,
and the immense high-tech infrastructure.

Cambodia

Introduction

Cambodia

Background:  Following a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge
forces captured Phnom Penh in 1975 and ordered the evacuation of all
cities and towns; over 1 million displaced people died from execution
or enforced hardships. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge
into the countryside and touched off 13 years of fighting. UN-sponsored
elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy, as did the
rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1990s. A coalition
government, formed after national elections in 1998, brought renewed
political stability and the surrender of remaining Khmer Rouge forces.

with Thailand have resulted in habitat loss and declining biodiversity (in
particular, destruction of mangrove swamps threatens natural fisheries);
soil erosion; in rural areas, a majority of the population does not have
access to potable water; toxic waste delivery from Taiwan sparked unrest
in Kampong Saom (Sihanoukville) in December 1998

Economy Cambodia

Economy - overview:  Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98
due to the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political
infighting. Foreign investment and tourism fell off. In 1999, the first
full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and
growth resumed at 5%. GDP growth for 2000 had been projected to reach
5.5%, but the worst flooding in 70 years severely damaged agricultural
crops, and high oil prices hurt industrial production, and growth for the
year is estimated at only 4%. In 2001, severe floods damaged an estimated
15% of the area devoted to rice. Tourism now is Cambodia's fastest growing
industry, with arrivals up 34% in 2000 and up another 40% in 2001 before
the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. The long-term development
of the economy after decades of war remains a daunting challenge. The
population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the
poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of
basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption
within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign
aid. On the brighter side, the government is addressing these issues
with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.

Introduction

Chad

Background:  Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured
three decades of ethnic warfare as well as invasions by Libya before
a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
eventually suppressed or came to terms with most political-military
groups, settled a territorial dispute with Libya on terms favorable to
Chad, drafted a democratic constitution, and held multiparty presidential
and National Assembly elections in 1996 and 1997 respectively. In 1998
a new rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which continued to escalate
throughout 2000. A peace agreement, signed in January 2002 between the
government and the rebels, provides for the demobilization of the rebels
and their reintegration into the political system. Despite movement
toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern
ethnic oligarchy.

Economy Chad

Economy - overview:  Chad's primarily agricultural economy will be boosted
by major oilfield and pipeline projects that began in 2000. Over 80% of
Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and stock raising for
their livelihood.  Cotton, cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of
Chad's export earnings, but Chad will begin to export oil in 2004. Chad's
economy has long been handicapped by its land-locked position, high energy
costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign assistance and
foreign capital for most public and private sector investment projects. A
consortium led by two US companies is investing $3.7 billion to develop
oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels in southern Chad.

Economy Sri Lanka

Economy - overview:  In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic policies
and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented policies
and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic sectors now are food
processing, textiles and apparel, food and beverages, telecommunications,
and insurance and banking. By 1996 plantation crops made up only 20% of
exports (compared with 93% in 1970), while textiles and garments accounted
for 63%. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% throughout the 1990s
until a drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth
to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in 1997-2000 with average growth
of 5.3%. But 2001 saw the first contraction in the country's history,
due to a combination of power shortages, severe budgetary problems,
the global slowdown, and continuing civil strife.

Economy Congo, Republic of the

Economy - overview:  The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support services,
and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Oil
has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a
major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s,
rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale
development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the
highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial
portion of its oil earnings, contributing to a shortage of revenues. The
12 January 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted
in inflation of 61% in 1994, but inflation has subsided since. Economic
reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations,
notably the World Bank and the IMF. The reform program came to a
halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who
returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly expressed
interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and
in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions.
However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and
the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the
republic's budget deficit. Given a fragile peace, agreements with the IMF
and the World Bank, and general international support for reconstruction
and development, prospects for structural reform and 4% growth in 2002-03
appear strong.

Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Introduction

Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Background:  Since 1997 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC;
formerly called Zaire) has been rent by ethnic strife and civil war,
touched off by a massive inflow in 1994 of refugees from the fighting
in Rwanda and Burundi.  The government of former president MOBUTU Sese
Seko was toppled by a rebellion led by Laurent KABILA in May 1997;
his regime was subsequently challenged by a Rwanda- and Uganda-backed
rebellion in August 1998. Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Chad,
and Sudan intervened to support the Kinshasa regime. A cease-fire was
signed on 10 July 1999 by the DROC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Uganda, Namibia,
Rwanda, and Congolese armed rebel groups RCD-G and MLC, but sporadic
fighting continued. KABILA was assassinated on 16 January 2001 and his
son Joseph KABILA was named head of state on 26 January 2001. Despite
taking a radically different approach than his father, the new president
has been equally unsuccessful in ending the war.

875,000 refugees to return to Rwanda in late 1996 and early 1997 and
additional refugees have returned in subsequent years; fighting between
the Congolese government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese rebels
spawned a regional war in DROC in August 1998, which left 1.8 million
Congolese displaced in DROC and caused 300,000 Congolese refugees to
flee to surrounding countries (2002 est.)

Economy Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Economy - overview:  The economy of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo - a nation endowed with vast potential wealth - has declined
drastically since the mid-1980s.  The war, which began in August 1998,
has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and has
increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due
to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure,
and the difficult operating environment. The war has intensified the
impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption,
raging inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy
and financial operations. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have
met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan,
and President KABILA has begun implementing reforms.

Introduction

China

Background:  For centuries China stood as a leading civilization,
outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences. But in the
19th and early 20th centuries, China was beset by civil unrest, major
famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II,
the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship that, while
ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday
life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, his
successor DENG Xiaoping gradually introduced market-oriented reforms
and decentralized economic decision making, and output quadrupled by
2000. Political controls remain tight even while economic controls
continue to be relaxed.

Economy China

Economy - overview:  In late 1978 the Chinese leadership began moving the
economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
market-oriented system. Whereas the system operates within a political
framework of strict Communist control, the economic influence of non-state
organizations and individual citizens has been steadily increasing.
The authorities have switched to a system of household and village
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry,
permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and
light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade
and investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In
2001, with its 1.27 billion people but a GDP of just $4,300 per capita,
China stood as the second largest economy in the world after the US
(measured on a purchasing power parity basis). Agriculture and industry
have posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong
and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment has helped spur output of
both domestic and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has
often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy and lassitude) and of capitalism (windfall gains and
growing income disparities). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. The government has struggled
to (a) collect revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals;
(b) reduce corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat
the large state-owned enterprises many of which had been shielded from
competition by subsidies and had been losing the ability to pay full
wages and pensions. From 80 to 120 million surplus rural workers are
adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through
part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central policy,
and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population
control program, which is essential to maintaining long-term growth in
living standards.  Another long-term threat to continued rapid economic
growth is the deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution,
soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the
north. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
development. Beijing will intensify efforts to stimulate growth through
spending on infrastructure - such as water control and power grids -
and poverty relief and through rural tax reform aimed at eliminating
arbitrary local levies on farmers. Access to the World Trade Organization
strengthens China's ability to maintain sturdy growth rates, and at
the same time puts additional pressure on the hybrid system of strong
political controls and growing market influences. Although Beijing has
claimed 7%-8% annual growth in recent years, many observers believe the
rate, while strong, is more like 5%.

Economy Chile

Economy - overview:  Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized
by a high level of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's
reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when
the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from
the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the
military government.  Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97,
but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global financial
crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in 1999, reducing crop
yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and electricity rationing,
and Chile experienced negative economic growth for the first time in more
than 15 years. Despite the effects of the recession, Chile maintained
its reputation for strong financial institutions and sound policy that
have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. By
the end of 1999, exports and economic activity had begun to recover,
and growth rebounded to 5.4% in 2000. Unemployment remains stubbornly
high, however, putting pressure on President LAGOS to improve living
standards. The Argentine financial meltdown has put pressure on the
Chilean peso and is slowing the country's economic growth.  Meanwhile,
Chile and the US are conducting negotiations for a free trade agreement.

Economy Cameroon

Economy - overview:  Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of
the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such
as a top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate
for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked
on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business
investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and
recapitalize the nation's banks. In June 2000, the government completed
an IMF-sponsored, three-year structural adjustment program; however, the
IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency
and privatization. International oil and cocoa prices have considerable
impact on the economy.

Economy Comoros

Economy - overview:  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made
up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young
and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level
of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign
grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting,
and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food
production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The
government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training,
to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health
services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the
high population growth rate. Increased foreign support is essential if
the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be met. Remittances from 150,000
Comorans abroad help supplement GDP.

Introduction

Colombia

Background:  Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and
Venezuela). A 40-year insurgent campaign to overthrow the Colombian
Government escalated during the 1990s, undergirded in part by funds
from the drug trade.  Although the violence is deadly and large swaths
of the countryside are under guerrilla influence, the movement lacks
the military strength or popular support necessary to overthrow the
government.  An anti-insurgent army of paramilitaries has grown to be
several thousand strong in recent years, challenging the insurgents for
control of territory and illicit industries such as the drug trade and
the government's ability to exert its dominion over rural areas. While
Bogota continues to try to negotiate a settlement, neighboring countries
worry about the violence spilling over their borders.

Economy Colombia

Economy - overview:  Colombia's economy suffered from weak domestic
demand, austere government budgets, and a difficult security situation. A
new president takes office in 2002 and will face economic challenges
ranging from pension reform to reduction of unemployment. Two of
Colombia's leading exports, oil and coffee, face an uncertain future; new
exploration is needed to offset declining oil production, while coffee
harvests and prices are depressed. Problems in public security are a
concern for Colombian business leaders, who are calling for progress in
the government's peace negotiations with insurgent groups. Colombia is
looking for continued support from the international community to boost
economic and peace prospects.

have caused a temporary slowdown. The agricultural sector is made up of
cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes,
and melons. Garment production is by far the most important industry
with employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments
to the US under duty and quota exemptions.

Economy Costa Rica

Economy - overview:  Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends
on tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social safety
net has been put into place. Foreign investors remain attracted by the
country's political stability and high education levels, and tourism
continues to bring in foreign exchange. However, traditional export
sectors have not kept pace. Low coffee prices and an overabundance of
bananas have hurt the agricultural sector. The government continues to
grapple with its large deficit and massive internal debt and with the need
to modernize the state-owned electricity and telecommunications sector.

Economy Central African Republic

Economy - overview:  Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The
agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted for
about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for 54%. Important
constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position,
a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a
legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of
the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had
mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton
exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and
nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were
accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of
2%. The IMF approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998
and the World Bank extended further credits in 1999 and approved a $10
million loan in early 2001. As of January 2002, many civil servants
were owed as much as 16 months pay during the PATASSE administration,
as well as 14 months pay from the KOLINGBA administration.

Cuba

Introduction

Cuba

Background:  Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron
rule has held the country together since. Cuba's Communist revolution,
with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The country is now slowly recovering
from a severe economic recession in 1990, following the withdrawal of
former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Havana
portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place
since 1961. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien
smugglers, or falsified visas - is a continuing problem. Some 3,000
Cubans attempted the crossing of the Straits of Florida in 2001; the US
Coast Guard interdicted only about 25% of these.

Economy Cuba

Economy - overview:  The government continues to balance the need for
economic loosening against a concern for firm political control. It has
undertaken limited reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity,
increase enterprise efficiency, and alleviate serious shortages of
food, consumer goods, and services, but is unlikely to implement
extensive changes. A major feature of the economy is the dichotomy
between relatively efficient export enclaves and inefficient domestic
sectors. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level
than before the severe economic depression of the early 1990s, which
was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. High
oil prices, recessions in key export markets, and damage from Hurricane
Michelle hampered growth in 2001. Cuba paid high prices for oil imports
in the face of slumping prices in the key sugar and nickel industries
and suffered a slowdown in tourist arrivals following September 11. The
government subsequently depreciated the peso by approximately 30% and
now aims for 3% growth in 2002.

Economy Cape Verde

Economy - overview:  Cape Verde suffers from a poor natural resource base,
including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term
drought. The economy is service-oriented, with commerce, transport,
and public services accounting for 70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of
the population lives in rural areas, the share of agriculture in GDP
in 2001 was only 11%, of which fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 82% of
food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna,
is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
supplement GDP by more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new
democratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector
and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects
for 2002 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances,
and the momentum of the government's development program.

Cook Islands

Introduction Cook Islands

Background:  Named after Captain Cook, who sighted them in 1770, the
islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative
control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965 residents chose
self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration of
skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are continuing
problems.

Economy Cook Islands

Economy - overview:  Like many other South Pacific island nations,
the Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of
the country from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets,
lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters,
and inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture provides the economic base with
major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities
are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade
deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived
beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating
a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state
assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement of
tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment
and growth.

Cyprus

Introduction

Cyprus

Background:  Independence from the UK was approved in 1960 with
constitutional guarantees by the Greek Cypriot majority to the Turkish
Cypriot minority. In 1974, a Greek-sponsored attempt to seize the
government was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon
controlled almost 40% of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area
declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", but it is
recognized only by Turkey.  UN-led talks on the status of Cyprus resumed
in December 1999 to prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations
leading to a comprehensive settlement.

Economy Cyprus

Economy - overview:  Economic affairs are affected by the division
of the country. The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly
susceptible to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s
reflect the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals,
caused by political instability in the region and fluctuations in
economic conditions in Western Europe.  Economic policy is focused on
meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish sector,
water shortages are a perennial problem; a few desalination plants
are now online. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than one-half the
per capita GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey,
it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign
firms have hesitated to invest there. It remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service, which together employ about half of
the work force. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides
substantial direct and indirect aid to tourism, education, industry, etc.

payments surplus. The government has been successful in meeting, and
even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for participating in
the third phase (a common European currency) of the European Monetary
Union (EMU), but Denmark, in a September 2000 referendum, reconfirmed
its decision not to join the 11 other EU members in the euro. Even so,
the Danish currency remains pegged to the euro.

Economy Djibouti

Economy - overview:  The economy is based on service activities connected
with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
northeast Africa.  Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must
be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of
payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of 50%
continues to be a major problem. Inflation is not a concern, however,
because of the fixed tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita
consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because
of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including
immigrants and refugees). Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties,
the government has fallen in arrears on long-term external debt and has
been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors. Another
factor limiting growth is the negative impact on port activity now that
Ethiopia has more trade route options.

Introduction

Dominica

Background:  Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which
made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence,
Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration
was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime
minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years.

Economy Dominica

Economy - overview:  The Dominican economy depends on agriculture,
primarily bananas, and remains highly vulnerable to climatic
conditions. Hurricane Luis devastated the country's banana crop in
1995 after tropical storms wiped out a quarter of the 1994 crop. The
subsequent recovery has been fueled by increases in construction, soap
production, and tourist arrivals. Development of the tourism industry
remains difficult however, because of the rugged coastline, lack of
beaches, and the absence of an international airport. Economic growth is
sluggish, and unemployment is greater than 20%. The government has been
attempting to develop an offshore financial sector in order to diversify
the island's production base.

Background:  First discovered by the British in 1821, the uninhabited
island was annexed by the US in 1858, but abandoned in 1879 after tons
of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island in 1889, but never
carried out plans for further exploitation. The US occupied and reclaimed
the island in 1935. Abandoned after World War II, the island is currently
a National Wildlife Refuge administered by the US Department of the

Economy Dominican Republic

Economy - overview:  The Dominican economy experienced dramatic growth
over the last decade, even though the economy was hit hard by Hurricane
Georges in 1998.  Although the country has long been viewed primarily as
an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, in recent years the service
sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer,
due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The country suffers from
marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives
less than one-fifth of GNP, while the richest 10% enjoy 40% of national
income. A US $500 million foreign bond issue in September 2001 will
contribute to increased public investment spending.

Economy Ecuador

Economy - overview:  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its accession
commitments. The aftermath of El Nino and depressed oil market of 1997-98
drove Ecuador's economy into a free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999
saw the banking sector collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented
default on external loans later that year. Continued economic instability
drove a 70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which forced
a desperate government to "dollarize" the currency regime in 2000. The
move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the ouster of the
government. Gustavo NOBOA, who assumed the presidency in January 2000,
has managed to pass substantial economic reforms and mend relations
with international financial institutions. Ecuador completed its first
standby agreement since 1986 when the IMF Board approved a 10 December
2001 disbursement of $96 million, the final installment of a $300 million
standby credit agreement.

Egypt

Introduction

Egypt

Background:  Nominally independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of the Aswan High
Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored
place of the Nile river in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A
rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable
land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and
stress society. The government has struggled to ready the economy for
the new millennium through economic reform and massive investment in
communications and physical infrastructure.

Economy Egypt

Economy - overview:  Egypt improved its macroeconomic performance
throughout most of the last decade by following IMF advice on fiscal,
monetary, and structural reform policies. As a result, Cairo managed
to tame inflation, slash budget deficits, and attract more foreign
investment. In the past three years, however, the pace of reform has
slackened, and excessive spending on national infrastructure projects
has widened budget deficits again. Lower foreign exchange earnings since
1998 resulted in pressure on the Egyptian pound and periodic dollar
shortages. Monetary pressures have increased since 11 September 2001
because of declines in tourism, Suez canal tolls, and exports, and Cairo
has devalued the pound several times in the past year.  The development
of a gas export market is a major bright spot for future growth prospects.

Ireland

Introduction

Ireland

Background:  A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several
years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from
the UK for the 26 southern counties; the six northern counties (Ulster)
remained part of Great Britain. In 1948 Ireland withdrew from the
British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973. Irish
governments have sought the peaceful unification of Ireland and have
cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A peace settlement
for Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement and approved

Economy Ireland

Economy - overview:  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy
with growth averaging a robust 9% in 1995-2001. Agriculture, once the
most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts
for 38% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor
force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust
growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer spending
and recovery in both construction and business investment. Over the past
decade, the Irish government has implemented a series of national economic
programs designed to curb inflation, reduce government spending, increase
labor force skills, and promote foreign investment.  Ireland joined in
launching the euro currency system in January 1999 along with 10 other
EU nations. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown
in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector; the growth rate was
cut by nearly half. Growth in 2002 is expected to fall in the 3%-5% range.

Economy Equatorial Guinea

Economy - overview:  The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves
have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Forestry,
farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming predominates.  Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect
of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential
for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to
reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid programs
sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since
1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for
concessional financing because of large oil revenues, the government
has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a "shadow" fiscal management
program with the World Bank and IMF.  Businesses, for the most part,
are owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped
natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and
alluvial gold. Boosts in production and higher world oil prices stimulated
growth in 2002, with oil accounting for 90% of increased exports.

1980; in connection with the start-up of new water purification plants,
the pollution load of wastewater decreased; Estonia has more than 1,400
natural and manmade lakes, the smaller of which in agricultural areas
need to be monitored; coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations

Eritrea

Introduction

Eritrea

Background:  Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two and a half year
border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices on
12 December 2000.  Eritrea currently hosts a UN peacekeeping operation
that will monitor the border region until an international commission
determines and demarcates the boundary between the two countries.

Economy Eritrea

Economy - overview:  Since independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
Eritrea has faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor
country. Like the economies of many African nations, the economy is
largely based on subsistence agriculture, with 80% of the population
involved in farming and herding. The Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998-2000
severely hurt Eritrea's economy. GDP growth in 1999 fell to less than 1%,
and GDP decreased by 8.2% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into
northern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss,
including losses of $225 million in livestock and 55,000 homes. The attack
prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region, causing
food production to drop by 62%. Even during the war, Eritrea developed
its transportation infrastructure, asphalting new roads, improving its
ports, and repairing war damaged roads and bridges. Eritrea's economic
future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used
Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole
to fill. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master
fundamental social problems like illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills,
and to convert the diaspora's money and expertise into economic growth.

Economy El Salvador

Economy - overview:  El Salvador is a struggling Central American
economy which has been suffering from a weak tax collection system,
factory closings, the aftermaths of Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and the
devastating earthquakes of early 2001, and weak world coffee prices. On
the bright side, in recent years inflation has fallen to single digit
levels, and total exports have grown substantially. The trade deficit
has been offset by remittances (an estimated $1.6 billion in 2000) from
Salvadorans living abroad and by external aid. As of 1 January 2001,
the US dollar was made legal tender alongside the colon. Growth in 2002
will depend largely on the speed of recovery in the US.

Introduction

Ethiopia

Background:  Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule, one exception being
the Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974 a military junta, the Derg,
deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established
a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought,
and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled by a
coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic
Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A constitution was adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's
first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A two and a half year
border war with Eritrea ended with a peace treaty on 12 December 2000.

Economy Ethiopia

Economy - overview:  Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on
agriculture, which accounts for half of GDP, 85% of exports, and 80% of
total employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought
and poor cultivation practices, and as many as 4.6 million people need
food assistance annually. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy with
exports of some $260 million in 2000. Other important exports include
qat, live animals, hides, and gold. The war with Eritrea in 1999-2000
and recurrent drought have buffeted the economy, in particular coffee
production. In November 2001 Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Under Ethiopia's land
tenure system, the government owns all land and provides long-term leases
to the tenants; the system continues to hamper growth in the industrial
sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use land as collateral for loans.
Despite this limitation, strong growth is expected to continue in the
near term as good rainfall, the cessation of hostilities, and renewed
foreign aid and debt relief push the economy forward.

Czech Republic

Introduction Czech Republic

Background:  After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet
sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize party rule and create
"socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following
year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of
Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a
peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a
"velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia. Now a member of NATO, the Czech Republic has moved toward
integration in world markets, a development that poses both opportunities
and risks.

Economy Czech Republic

Economy - overview:  Basically one of the most stable and prosperous of
the post-Communist states, the Czech Republic has been recovering from
recession since mid-1999. Growth in 2000-01 was led by exports to the
EU, especially Germany, and foreign investment, while domestic demand is
reviving.  Uncomfortably high fiscal and current account deficits could
be future problems. Unemployment is gradually declining as job creation
continues in the rebounding economy; inflation is up to 4.7% but still
moderate. The EU put the Czech Republic just behind Poland and Hungary in
preparations for accession, which will give further impetus and direction
to structural reform. Moves to complete banking, telecommunications, and
energy privatization will add to foreign investment, while intensified
restructuring among large enterprises and banks and improvements in the
financial sector should strengthen output growth.

Economy French Guiana

Economy - overview:  The economy is tied closely to the French economy
through subsidies and imports.  Besides the French space center at Kourou,
fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities. Forest
and woodland cover 90% of the country. The large reserves of tropical
hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry
that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops is limited to
the coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated; rice
and manioc are the major crops. French Guiana is heavily dependent
on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
particularly among younger workers.

Finland

Introduction

Finland

Background:  Ruled by Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries and by
Russia from 1809, Finland finally won its independence in 1917. During
World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and fend off
invasions by the Soviet Union and Germany. In the subsequent half century,
the Finns have made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy
to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now
on par with Western Europe. As a member of the European Union, Finland
was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in
January 1999.

Economy Finland

Economy - overview:  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing
- principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications,
and electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equaling
almost one-third of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods.  Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry,
an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the
rural population. Rapidly increasing integration with Western Europe -
Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the euro monetary system
(EMU) on 1 January 1999 - will dominate the economic picture over the
next several years. Growth in 2001 was held back by the global slowdown
and will likely be anemic again in 2002.

Fiji

Introduction

Fiji

Background:  Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as
a British colony.  Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups
in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by
the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the
islands by the British in the 19th century). A 1990 constitution favored
native Melanesian control of Fiji, but led to heavy Indian emigration;
the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that
Melanesians became the majority. Amendments enacted in 1997 made the
constitution more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted
in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a coup in May of 2000 ushered
in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held
in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government
and gave a mandate to the government of Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE.

Economy Fiji

Economy - overview:  Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies,
though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports and a growing
tourist industry - with 300,000 to 400,000 tourists annually - are the
major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third
of industrial activity. Long-term problems include low investment and
uncertain property rights. The political turmoil in Fiji has had a severe
impact with the economy shrinking by 2.8% in 2000 and growing by only 1%

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Introduction

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Background:  Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592,
the first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later
in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until
1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the
islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first
between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK
asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there
in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British
responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and
after fierce fighting forced Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.

Economy Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Economy - overview:  The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic
activity. In 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign
trawlers operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These
license fees total more than $40 million per year, which goes to support
the island's health, education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for
75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption;
crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade
wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. The islands
are now self-financing except for defense. The British Geological
Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in
1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of
producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date no exploitable site has been
identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to
defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign
interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Tourism is increasing
rapidly, with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. The second largest source
of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank.
The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.

Economy Micronesia, Federated States of

Economy - overview:  Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence
farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth
exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist
industry exists, but the remote location and a lack of adequate facilities
hinder development. In 1996, the country experienced a 20% reduction in
revenues from the Compact of Free Association - the agreement with the
US in which Micronesia received $1.3 billion in financial and technical
assistance over a 15-year period until 2001. Since these revenues
accounted for 57% of consolidated government revenues, reduced Compact
funding resulted in a severe depression. Economic activity recovered in
1999-2001. The country's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due
to likely further reductions in external grants made under the US Compact
funding. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure
remain major impediments to long-term growth.

Economy Faroe Islands

Economy - overview:  The Faroese economy has had a strong performance
since 1994, mostly as a result of increasing fish landings and high and
stable export prices.  Unemployment is falling and there are signs of
labor shortages in several sectors. The positive economic development
has helped the Faroese Home Rule Government produce increasing budget
surpluses which in turn help to reduce the large public debt, most of
it owed to Denmark. However, the total dependence on fishing makes the
Faroese economy extremely vulnerable, and the present fishing efforts
appear in excess of what is a sustainable level of fishing in the long
term. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the
immediate Faroese area, which may eventually lay the basis for a more
diversified economy and thus lessen dependence on Denmark and Danish
economic assistance. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy (15% of GDP)
from Denmark, the Faroese have a standard of living not far below the
Danes and other Scandinavians.

Economy French Polynesia

Economy - overview:  Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel
in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy to
one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed by
the military or supports the tourist industry. With the halt of French
nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to the economy fell
sharply. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary
source of hard currency earnings. Other sources of income are pearl
farming and deep-sea commercial fishing. The small manufacturing sector
primarily processes agricultural products. The territory substantially
benefits from development agreements with France aimed principally at
creating new businesses and strengthening social services.

Baker Island

Introduction Baker Island

Background:  The US took possession of the island in 1857, and its guano
deposits were mined by US and British companies during the second half
of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization was
begun on this island - as well as on nearby Howland Island - but was
disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned. Presently the island
is a National Wildlife Refuge run by the US Department of the Interior;
a day beacon is situated near the middle of the west coast.

Introduction

France

Background:  Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France
suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as
a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most
modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations.
Since 1958, it has constructed a presidential democracy resistant to the
instabilities experienced in earlier parliamentary democracies. In recent
years, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central
to the economic integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro
in January 1999.  Presently, France is at the forefront of European states
seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation
of a more unified and capable European defense and security apparatus.

Economy France

Economy - overview:  France is in the midst of transition, from a
well-to-do modern economy that featured extensive government ownership
and intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
Socialist-led government has partially or fully privatized many large
companies, banks, and insurers, but still retains large stakes in
several leading firms, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault,
and Thales, and remains dominant in some sectors, particularly power,
public transport, and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is
gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain committed
to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws,
tax policies, and social spending that reduce income disparity and
the impact of free markets on public health and welfare. The current
government has lowered income taxes and introduced measures to boost
employment, but has done little to reform an overly expensive pension
system, rigid labor market, and restrictive bureaucracy that discourage
hiring and make the tax burden one of the highest in Europe. In addition
to the tax burden, the reduction of the workweek to 35 hours, which is to
be extended to small firms in 2002, has drawn criticism for lowering the
competitiveness of French businesses. The current economic slowdown has
thrown the government's goal of balancing the budget by 2004 off track.

Introduction

Gambia, The

Background:  The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965; it
formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia with Senegal between 1982
and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation
treaty. A military coup in 1994 overthrew the president and banned
political activity, but a new 1996 constitution and presidential
elections, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
nominal return to civilian rule. The country undertook another round of
presidential and legislative elections in late 2001 and early 2002.

Economy Gambia, The

Economy - overview:  The Gambia has no important mineral or other
natural resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale
manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and
hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic
activity, but a 1999 government-imposed preshipment inspection plan,
and instability of the Gambian dalasi (currency) have drawn some of
the reexport trade away from Banjul. The government's 1998 seizure
of the private peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest purchaser
of Gambian groundnuts; the following two marketing seasons have seen
substantially lower prices and sales. A decline in tourism in 2000
has also held back growth. Unemployment and underemployment rates are
extremely high. Shortrun economic progress remains highly dependent
on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government
economic management as forwarded by IMF technical help and advice, and
on expected growth in the construction sector. Record crops undergirded
sturdy growth in 2001.

Gabon

Introduction

Gabon

Background:  Ruled by autocratic presidents since independence from France
in 1960, Gabon introduced a multiparty system and a new constitution in
the early 1990s that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and
for reforms of governmental institutions. A small population, abundant
natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make
Gabon one of the more prosperous black African countries.

Economy Gabon

Economy - overview:  Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that
of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp
decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a
large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to
face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports.
Despite the abundance of natural wealth, the economy is hobbled by poor
fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP,
and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to
a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private
creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12 January
1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to
6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95,
a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates
beginning in late 1995, and stand-by credit of $119 million in October
2000. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January 1997
after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to
Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items,
overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for
privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in
1999-2000 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from
fully realizing potential gains. In December 2000, Gabon signed a new
agreement with the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. A follow-up
bilateral repayment agreement with the US was signed in December 2001.

Georgia

Introduction

Georgia

Background:  Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th
century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian
revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet
Union dissolved in 1991. Ethnic separation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
poor governance, and Russian military bases deny the government effective
control over the entirety of the state's internationally recognized
territory. Despite myriad problems, progress on market reforms and
democratization support the country's goal of greater integration with
Western political, economic and security institutions.

Economy Georgia

Economy - overview:  Georgia's main economic activities include
the cultivation of agricultural products such as citrus fruits, tea,
hazelnuts, and grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a
small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages,
metals, machinery, and chemicals. The country imports the bulk of its
energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable
internal energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the
economy has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of
the IMF and World Bank, has made substantial economic gains since 1995,
achieving positive GDP growth and curtailing inflation.  However, the
Georgian government suffers from limited resources due to a chronic
failure to collect tax revenues. Georgia also suffers from energy
shortages; it privatized the T'bilisi distribution network in 1998,
but collection rates are low, making the venture unprofitable. The
country is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery on its role as a
transit state for pipelines and trade.  The start of construction on
the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in summer 2002 will bring much-needed
investment and job opportunities to the country.

Introduction

Ghana

Background:  Formed from the merger of the British colony of the
Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became
the first country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. A long
series of coups resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981
and the banning of political parties. A new constitution, restoring
multiparty politics, was approved in 1992. Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS, head
of state since 1981, won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but
was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000.
He was succeeded by John KUFUOR.

Economy Ghana

Economy - overview:  Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
roughly twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West
Africa. Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international
financial and technical assistance.  Gold, timber, and cocoa production
are major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues
to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 36% of GDP
and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. Excessively
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy prior to the 2000 elections led
to accelerating inflation in early 2001. A depressed cocoa market and
continued weak growth in non-traditional exports led to disappointing
growth in 2001. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002.

Gibraltar

Introduction

Gibraltar

Background:  Strategically important, Gibraltar was ceded to Great
Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was
formally declared a colony in 1830. In a 1967 referendum, Gibraltarians
ignored Spanish pressure and voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
dependency. Spain and the UK are discussing the issue of Gibraltar and
have set the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-2002.

Economy Gibraltar

Economy - overview:  Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and
now contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
accounts for 20% of GDP; tourism (almost 6 million visitors in 1998),
shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate
revenue.  In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major structural change
from a public to a private sector economy, but changes in government
spending still have a major impact on the level of employment.

Economy Grenada

Economy - overview:  Despite government steadying of annual economic
growth in recent years through progress in fiscal reform and prudent
macroeconomic management, a downturn in tourist arrivals in 2001 threatens

source of foreign exchange, although it also supports a small agriculture
sector and a developing offshore financial industry. Short-term concerns
include a rising fiscal deficit and the deterioration in the external
account balance.

Economy Greenland

Economy - overview:  The economy remains critically dependent on exports
of fish and substantial support from the Danish Government, which supplies
about half of government revenues. The public sector, including publicly
owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role
in the economy.  Despite several interesting hydrocarbon and minerals
exploration activities, it will take several years before production can
materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential,
and even this is limited due to a short season and high costs.

Introduction

Germany

Background:  As Europe's largest economy and most populous nation,
Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political,
and defense organizations.  European power struggles immersed the country
in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and
left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK,
France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two
German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic
FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations,
the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the
front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the
end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then
Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity
and wages up to western standards. In January 2002, Germany and 11 other
EU countries introduced a common European currency, the euro.

Economy Germany

Economy - overview:  Germany's affluent and technologically powerful
economy turned in a relatively weak performance throughout much of the
1990s. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy
continues to be a costly long-term problem, with annual transfers
from west to east amounting to roughly $70 billion. Germany's ageing
population, combined with high unemployment, has pushed social security
outlays to a level exceeding contributions from workers. Structural
rigidities in the labor market - including strict regulations on
laying off workers and the setting of wages on a national basis -
have made unemployment a chronic problem. Business and income tax cuts
introduced in 2001 did not spare Germany from the impact of the downturn
in international trade, and domestic demand faltered as unemployment began
to rise. The government expects growth to gain pace in the second half of
2002, but to fall short of 1% for the year again. Corporate restructuring
and growing capital markets are setting the foundations that could allow
Germany to meet the long-term challenges of European economic integration
and globalization, particularly if labor market rigidities are addressed.

Economy Guadeloupe

Economy - overview:  The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It also depends on France for large subsidies
and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US;
an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The
traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such
as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant,
and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local
consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food,
mainly from France. Light industry features sugar and rum production. Most
manufactured goods and fuel are imported.  Unemployment is especially
high among the young. Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.

Economy Guam

Economy - overview:  The economy depends on US military spending,
tourism, and the export of fish and handicrafts. Total US grants, wage
payments, and procurement outlays amounted to $1 billion in 1998. Over
the past 20 years, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, creating a
construction boom for new hotels and the expansion of older ones. More
than 1 million tourists visit Guam each year. The industry has recently
suffered setbacks because of the continuing Japanese slowdown; the
Japanese normally make up almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and
industrial goods are imported. Guam faces the problem of building up
the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.

Introduction

Greece

Background:  Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in
1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of
the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories
with Greek-speaking populations. Following the defeat of Communist
rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military dictatorship,
which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and forced the king to
flee the country, lasted seven years. Democratic elections in 1974 and a
referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy;
Greece joined the European Community or EC in 1981 (which became the EU
in 1992).

Economy Greece

Economy - overview:  Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the public
sector accounting for about half of GDP. Tourism is a key industry,
providing a large portion of GDP and foreign exchange earnings. Greece
is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of GDP. The economy
has improved steadily over the last few years, as the government tightened
policy in the run-up to Greece's entry into the EU's Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) on 1 January 2001. Major challenges remaining include the
reduction of unemployment and further restructuring of the economy,
including privatizing several state enterprises, undertaking social
security reforms, overhauling the tax system, and minimizing bureaucratic
inefficiencies. Economic growth is forecast at 3%-3.5% in 2002.

Economy Guatemala

Economy - overview:  The agricultural sector accounts for about one-fourth
of GDP, two-thirds of exports, and half of the labor force. Coffee,
sugar, and bananas are the main products. Former President ARZU
(1996-2000) worked to implement a program of economic liberalization
and political modernization. The 1996 signing of the peace accords,
which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to foreign
investment. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused relatively little damage to
Guatemala compared to its neighbors. Ongoing challenges include increasing
government revenues, negotiating further assistance from international
donors, and increasing the efficiency and openness of both government
and private financial operations.  Despite low international prices
for Guatemala's main commodities, the economy grew by 3% in 2000 and
2.3% in 2001. Guatemala, along with Honduras and El Salvador, recently
concluded a free trade agreement with Mexico and has moved to protect
international property rights. However, the PORTILLO administration has
undertaken a review of privatizations under the previous administration,
thereby creating some uncertainty among investors.

Economy Guinea

Economy - overview:  Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, yet remains an underdeveloped nation. The country
possesses over 30% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the second
largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about 75% of
exports in 1999. Long-run improvements in government fiscal arrangements,
literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to move out
of poverty. The government made encouraging progress in budget management
in 1997-99, and reform progress was praised in the World Bank/IMF October
2000 assessment. However, escalating fighting along the Sierra Leonean
and Liberian borders has caused major economic disruptions. In addition to
direct defense costs, the violence has led to a sharp decline in investor
confidence.  Foreign mining companies have reduced expatriate staff, while
panic buying has created food shortages and inflation in local markets.

Introduction

Guyana

Background:  Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966 and became a
republic in 1970. In 1989 Guyana launched an Economic Recovery Program,
which marked a dramatic reversal from a state-controlled, socialist
economy towards a more open, free market system. Results through the
first decade have proven encouraging.

Economy Guyana

Economy - overview:  The Guyanese economy has exhibited moderate economic
growth since 1999, based on an expansion in the agricultural and mining
sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more
realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support
of international organizations. Chronic problems include a shortage
of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is
juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded
public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities
combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries threaten the
government's already tenuous fiscal position and dim prospects for 2002.

Gaza Strip

Introduction Gaza Strip

Background:  The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers
and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West
Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the
Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron,
the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September
1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain
responsibility during the transitional period for external security
and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israeli
citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza
and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus,
but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September
2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian
Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

Economy Gaza Strip

Economy - overview:  Economic output in the Gaza Strip - under the
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo Agreement of
May 1994 - declined by about one-third between 1992 and 1996. The downturn
was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition
of generalized border closures in response to security incidents in
Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity
market relationships between Israel and the WBGS (West Bank and Gaza
Strip). The most serious negative social effect of this downturn was
the emergence of high unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the
1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's
use of comprehensive closures decreased during the next few years and,
in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures
and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and
labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6%
in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the
outbreak of Palestinian violence, triggering tight Israeli closures of
Palestinian self-rule areas and a severe disruption of trade and labor
movements. In 2001, and even more severely in early 2002, internal turmoil
and Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas resulted in
the destruction of capital plant and administrative structure, widespread
business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been
the decline in income earned by Palestinian workers in Israel.

Haiti

Introduction

Haiti

Background:  One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. Over
three decades of dictatorship followed by military rule ended in 1990
when Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE was elected president. Most of his term was
usurped by a military takeover, but he was able to return to office in
1994 and oversee the installation of a close associate to the presidency
in 1996. ARISTIDE won a second term as president in 2000, and took office
early in 2001. However, a political crisis stemming from fraudulent
legislative elections in 2000 has not yet been resolved.

Economy Haiti

Economy - overview:  About 80% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector,
which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs
about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country
has experienced little job creation since the former President
PREVAL took office in February 1996, although the informal economy
is growing. Following legislative elections in May 2000, fraught with
irregularities, international donors - including the US and EU - suspended
almost all aid to Haiti. The economy shrank an estimated 1.2% in 2001,
and the contraction will likely intensify in 2002 unless a political
agreement with donors is reached and aid restored.

Introduction Hong Kong

Background:  Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded
by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
in the 19th century.  Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and
the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this agreement,
China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula,
China's socialist economic system will not be imposed on Hong Kong and
that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except
foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.

Economy Hong Kong

Economy - overview:  Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy highly
dependent on international trade. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports and exports,
including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value. Even before Hong
Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1 July 1997 it had extensive
trade and investment ties with China. Per capita GDP compares with the
level in the four big economies of Western Europe. GDP growth averaged
a strong 5% in 1989-97. The widespread Asian economic difficulties
in 1998 hit this trade-dependent economy quite hard, with GDP down 5%.
The economy, with growth of 10% in 2000, recovered rapidly from the Asian
financial crisis. The recent global downturn has badly hurt Hong Kong's
exports and GDP growth is estimated to be 0% in 2001.  Private sector
analysts project 2002 GDP growth to be 1.8%.

Honduras

Introduction

Honduras

Background:  Part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
became an independent nation in 1821. After two and one-half decades of
mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power
in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista
contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to
Salvadoran Government forces fighting against leftist guerrillas.

development and improper land use practices such as farming of marginal
lands; mining activities polluting Lago de Yojoa (the country's largest
source of fresh water) as well as several rivers and streams with
heavy metals

Economy Honduras

Economy - overview:  Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere with an extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, is
banking on expanded trade privileges under the Enhanced Caribbean Basin
Initiative and on debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative. While the country has met most of its macroeconomic
targets, it failed to meet the IMF's goals to liberalize its energy and
telecommunications sectors. Growth remains dependent on the status of the
US economy, its major trading partner, on commodity prices, particularly
coffee, and on containment of the recent rise in crime.

took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying
Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands.  Under UN supervision

Economy Croatia

Economy - overview:  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. The economy emerged from its mild recession in 2000 with
tourism the main factor, but massive structural unemployment remains
a key negative element. The government's failure to press the economic
reforms needed to spur growth is largely the result of coalition politics
and public resistance, particularly from the trade unions, to measures
that would cut jobs, wages, or social benefits. As a result, the country
is likely to experience only moderate growth without disciplined fiscal
and structural reform.

Hungary

Introduction

Hungary

Background:  Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist
rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and announced withdrawal
from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by
Moscow. In the more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to
dissolve the Warsaw Pact and steadily shifted toward multiparty democracy
and a market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,
Hungary developed close political and economic ties to Western Europe. It
joined NATO in 1999 and is a frontrunner in a future expansion of the EU.

Iceland

Introduction

Iceland

Background:  Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish)
immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing, established
in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled
by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated
the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter
century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and
the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete
independence attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social
cohesion are first-rate by world standards.

Economy Iceland

Economy - overview:  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment, and
remarkably even distribution of income. In the absence of other natural
resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power),
the economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, providing 70%
of export earnings and employing 12% of the work force. The economy
remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in
world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,
and ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to continue its
policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting
foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and
fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned
industries. The government remains opposed to EU membership, primarily
because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing
resources.  Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and
service industries in the last decade, and new developments in software
production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The
tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism
and whale watching. Growth has been remarkably steady over the past five
years at 4%-5%.

authoritarianism, addressing charges of cronyism and corruption, holding
the military accountable for human rights violations, and resolving
growing separatist pressures in Aceh and Irian Jaya. On 30 August 1999
a provincial referendum for independence was overwhelmingly approved by
the people of Timor Timur. Concurrence followed by Indonesia's national
legislature, and the name East Timor was provisionally adopted. On 20 May
2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an independent state.

Economy Indonesia

Economy - overview:  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, faces severe
economic development problems, stemming from secessionist movements and
the low level of security in the regions, the lack of reliable legal
recourse in contract disputes, corruption, weaknesses in the banking
system, and strained relations with the IMF. Investor confidence will
remain low and few new jobs will be created under these circumstances. In
November 2001, Indonesia agreed with the IMF on a series of economic
reforms in 2002, thus enabling further IMF disbursements.  Keys to
future growth remain internal reform, the build-up of the confidence
of international donors and investors, and a strong comeback in the
global economy.

Introduction

India

Background:  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the
world, goes back at least 5,000 years. Aryan tribes from the northwest
invaded about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier inhabitants created
the classical Indian culture. Arab incursions starting in the 8th century
and Turkish in 12th were followed by European traders beginning in the
late 15th century. By the 19th century, Britain had assumed political
control of virtually all Indian lands.  Nonviolent resistance to British
colonialism under Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to independence
in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India
and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the
two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate
nation of Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in India include the ongoing
dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation, environmental
degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife, all
this despite impressive gains in economic investment and output.

Economy India

Economy - overview:  India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. About a quarter
of the population is too poor to be able to afford an adequate
diet. India's international payments position remained strong in 2001
with adequate foreign exchange reserves, and moderately depreciating
nominal exchange rates.  Growth in manufacturing output has slowed,
and electricity shortages continue in many regions. India has large
numbers of well-educated people skilled in English language; India is
a major exporter of software services and software workers.

Telephone system:  general assessment: mediocre service; local and long
distance service provided throughout all regions of the country, with

is taking place with the recent admission of private and private-public
investors, but, with telephone density at about two for each 100 persons
and a waiting list of over 2 million, demand for main line telephone
service will not be satisfied for a very long time domestic: local
service is provided by microwave radio relay and coaxial cable, with
open wire and obsolete electromechanical and manual switchboard systems
still in use in rural areas; starting in the 1980s, a substantial amount
of digital switch gear has been introduced for local and long-distance
service; long-distance traffic is carried mostly by coaxial cable and
low-capacity microwave radio relay; since 1985 significant trunk capacity
has been added in the form of fiber-optic cable and a domestic satellite
system with 254 earth stations; mobile cellular service is provided
in four metropolitan cities international: satellite earth stations -
8 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Inmarsat (Indian Ocean region); nine
gateway exchanges operating from Mumbai (Bombay), New Delhi, Kolkata
(Calcutta), Chennai (Madras), Jalandhar, Kanpur, Gaidhinagar, Hyderabad,

British Indian Ocean Territory

Introduction

British Indian Ocean Territory

Background:  Established as a territory of the UK in 1965, a number of
the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) islands were transferred to
the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT
has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos
Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia,
contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining
islands are uninhabited. Former agricultural workers, earlier residents
in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius but also to the
Seychelles, between 1967 and 1973. In 2000, a British High Court ruling
invalidated the local immigration order which had excluded them from
the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.

Iran

Introduction

Iran

Background:  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic
in 1979 after the ruling shah was forced into exile. Conservative clerical
forces subsequently crushed westernizing liberal elements. Militant
Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and
held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody,
indecisive war with Iraq over disputed territory. Key current issues
affecting the country include the pace of accepting outside modernizing
influences and reconciliation between clerical control of the regime
and popular government participation and widespread demands for reform.

Economy Iran

Economy - overview:  Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture,
and small-scale private trading and service ventures. President KHATAMI
has continued to follow the market reform plans of former President
RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he will pursue diversification of
Iran's oil-reliant economy although he has made little progress toward
that goal. The strong oil market in 1996 helped ease financial pressures
on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt service payments. Iran's
financial situation tightened in 1997 and deteriorated further in
1998 because of lower oil prices. The subsequent rise in oil prices
in 1999-2000 afforded Iran fiscal breathing room but does not solve
Iran's structural economic problems, including the encouragement of
foreign investment.

administered island in the Persian Gulf (called Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE
and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran); Iran insists on division of
Caspian Sea into five equal sectors while Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia,
and Turkmenistan have generally agreed upon equidistant seabed boundaries;
Iran threatens to conduct oil exploration in Azerbaijani-claimed waters,
while interdicting Azerbaijani activities

Illicit drugs:  despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran remains a
key transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe; domestic
narcotics consumption remains a persistent problem and Iranian press
reports estimate at least 1.8 million drug users in the country

Israel

Introduction

Israel

Background:  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish
states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the Israelis
defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions
between the two sides. The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967
war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise
noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the
1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Outstanding territorial and other disputes
with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of
Peace. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference
in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel
and Palestinian representatives (from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip) and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement; however, these
efforts were derailed/postponed by the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian
violence in September 2000. On 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally
from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982.

Economy Israel

Economy - overview:  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of
crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite
limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel
is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains. Cut
diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and
vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable current
account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad
and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt
is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and military
aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR during the
period 1989-99 coupled with the opening of new markets at the end of the
Cold War, energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in the early
1990s.  But growth began moderating in 1996 when the government imposed
tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the immigration bonus petered
out. Growth was a strong 6.4% in 2000. But the outbreak of Palestinian
unrest in late September 2000 and the declines in the high-technology
and tourist sectors led to a 0.6% drop in GDP in 2001.

Italy

Introduction

Italy

Background:  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the city-states
of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
King Victor EMMANUEL.  An era of parliamentary government came to a
close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in
1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO
and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront
of European economic and political unification, joining the European
Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration,
the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the
low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the
prosperous north.

Economy Italy

Economy - overview:  Italy has a diversified industrial economy with
roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the UK. This
capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north,
dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural
south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry
and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past
decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the
requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from
lower interest and inflation rates. Italy's economic performance has
lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has
enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness
and long-term growth. Rome has moved slowly, however, on implementing
needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and
overhauling Italy's rigid labor market and expensive pension system,
because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labor unions.

Cote d'Ivoire

Introduction Cote d'Ivoire

Background:  Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the
development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment
made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African
states. Falling cocoa prices and political turmoil, however, sparked an
economic downturn in 1999 and 2000. On 25 December 1999, a military coup
- the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government
led by President Henri Konan BEDIE. Presidential and legislative
elections held in October and December 2000 provoked violence due to
the exclusion of opposition leader Alassane OUATTARA. In October 2000,
Laurent GBAGBO replaced junta leader Robert GUEI as president, ending
10 months of military rule. In October 2001, President GBAGBO initiated
a two-month-long National Reconciliation Forum, but its ability to
conciliate Ivorians with one another remains unclear.

Economy Cote d'Ivoire

Economy - overview:  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil. Consequently, the
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for
these products and to weather conditions. Despite government attempts
to diversify the economy, it is still largely dependent on agriculture
and related activities, which engage roughly 68% of the population. After
several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback
in 1994, due to the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices
for cocoa and coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such
as pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization,
offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous external financing
and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. Moreover,
government adherence to donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in growth
to 5% annually during 1996-99. Growth was negative in 2000 and 2001
because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international
donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability.
Political instability continues to impede growth.

Iraq

Introduction

Iraq

Background:  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an
independent kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but
in actuality a series of military strongmen have ruled the country since
then, the latest being SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led
to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990
Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during
January-February 1991. The victors did not occupy Iraq, however, thus
allowing the regime to stay in control. Following Kuwait's liberation,
the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of
mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in effect due to incomplete Iraqi
compliance with relevant UNSC resolutions.

has been displaced; furthermore, the destruction of the natural habitat
poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations; inadequate
supplies of potable water; development of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers system

Economy Iraq

Economy - overview:  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which
has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In
the 1980s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the
eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran
led the government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and
later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses
from the war of at least $100 billion. After hostilities ended in 1988,
oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines
and restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in
August 1990, subsequent international economic sanctions, and damage
from military action by an international coalition beginning in January
1991 drastically reduced economic activity. Although government policies
supporting large military and internal security forces and allocating
resources to key supporters of the regime have hurt the economy,
implementation of the UN's oil-for-food program in December 1996 has
helped improve conditions for the average Iraqi citizen. For the first
six, six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export limited
amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and some infrastructure
spare parts.  In December 1999 the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to
export under the program as much oil as required to meet humanitarian
needs. Oil exports are now more than three-quarters prewar level.
However, 28% of Iraq's export revenues under the program are deducted to
meet UN Compensation Fund and UN administrative expenses. The drop in GDP
in 2001 was largely the result of the global economic slowdown and lower
oil prices. Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while
medical supplies and health care services are steadily improving. Per
capita output and living standards are still well below the prewar level,
but any estimates have a wide range of error.

Transnational Issues Iraq

Disputes - international:  despite restored diplomatic relations in
1990, lacks maritime boundary with Iran and disputes land boundary,
navigation channels, and other issues from eight-year war; in November
1994, Iraq formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which
had been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773
(1993), and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and
to Bubiyan and Warbah islands although the government continues periodic
rhetorical challenges; dispute over water development plans by Turkey
for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers

Introduction

Japan

Background:  While retaining its time-honored culture, Japan rapidly
absorbed Western technology during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. After its devastating defeat in World War II, Japan recovered
to become the second most powerful economy in the world and a staunch
ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of
national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful politicians,
bureaucrats, and business executives. The economy experienced a major
slowdown in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented growth.

Economy Japan

Economy - overview:  Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
rapidity to the rank of second most technologically powerful economy
in the world after the US and third largest economy in the world
after the US and China. One notable characteristic of the economy is
the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in
closely-knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been
the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the
urban labor force. Both features are now eroding. Industry, the most
important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw
materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly
subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the
world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50%
of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains
one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15%
of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had
been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s largely
because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late 1980s and
contractionary domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses
from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts to revive
economic growth have met with little success and were further hampered
in 2000-01 by the slowing of the US and Asian economies. The crowding
of habitable land area and the aging of the population are two major
long-run problems. Robotics constitutes a key long-term economic strength,
with Japan possessing 410,000 of the world's 720,000 "working robots".

Economy Jersey

Economy - overview:  The economy is based largely on international
financial services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower,
tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped
mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide
and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted
for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the
economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has
encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an
electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing
of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are imported,
as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death
duties make the island a popular tax haven.

Introduction

Jamaica

Background:  Jamaica gained full independence within the British
Commonwealth in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the
1970s led to recurrent violence and a dropoff in tourism. Elections
in 1980 saw the democratic socialists voted out of office. Subsequent
governments have been open market oriented. Political violence marred
elections during the 1990s.

Economy Jamaica

Economy - overview:  The economy, which depends heavily on tourism and
bauxite, has been stagnant since 1995. After five years of recession,
the economy grew 0.8% in 2000 and 1.1% in 2001, but the global economic
slowdown, particularly in the United States after the 11 September
terrorist attacks, has stunted the economic recovery. Serious problems
include: high interest rates; increased foreign competition; a pressured,
sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise trade deficit;
and a growing internal debt, the result of government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
sector. Depressed economic conditions have led to increased civil unrest,
including a mounting crime rate. Jamaica's medium-term prospects will
depend upon encouraging investment, maintaining a competitive exchange
rate, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing proper fiscal and
monetary policies.

Jordan

Introduction

Jordan

Background:  For most of its history since independence from British
administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN (1953-1999). A
pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from
the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel,
and a large internal Palestinian population, through several wars and
coup attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary elections and gradually
permitted political liberalization; in 1994 a formal peace treaty was
signed with Israel. King ABDALLAH II - the eldest son of King HUSSEIN
and Princess MUNA - assumed the throne following his father's death in
February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and established
his domestic priorities.

Economy Jordan

Economy - overview:  Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil. Debt,
poverty, and unemployment are fundamental problems, but King ABDALLAH
since assuming the throne in 1999 has undertaken some broad economic
reforms in a long-term effort to improve living standards. Amman in the
past three years has signed on to an IMF agreement, practiced careful
monetary policy, and made significant headway with privatization. The
government also has liberalized the trade regime sufficiently to secure
Jordan's membership in the WTrO, an association agreement with the EU,
and a free trade accord with US. These measures have helped improve
productivity and have put Jordan on the foreign investment map. Ongoing
challenges include fiscal adjustment to reduce the budget deficit and
broader investment incentives to promote job-creating ventures.

Kenya

Introduction

Kenya

Background:  Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo
KENYATTA led Kenya from independence until his death in 1978, when
current President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional
succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until
1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the
sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure
for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured
opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and
1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but are viewed as having
generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. The country faces a
period of political uncertainty because MOI is constitutionally required
to step down at the next election that has to be held by early 2003.

Economy Kenya

Economy - overview:  Kenya, the regional hub for trade and finance in East
Africa, is hampered by corruption and reliance upon several primary goods
whose prices continue to decline. Following strong economic growth in 1995
and 1996, Kenya's economy has stagnated, with GDP growth failing to keep
up with the rate of population growth. In 1997, the IMF suspended Kenya's
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government's failure
to maintain reforms and curb corruption. A severe drought from 1999 to
2000 compounded Kenya's problems, causing water and energy rationing
and reducing agricultural output. As a result, GDP contracted by 0.3%
in 2000. The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through
the drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed
to institute several anticorruption measures. Despite the return of
strong rains in 2001, weak commodity prices, endemic corruption, and low
investment limited Kenya's economic growth to 1%, and Kenya is unlikely
to see growth above 2% in 2002. Substantial IMF and other foreign support
is essential to prevent a further decline in real per capita output.

Economy Kyrgyzstan

Economy - overview:  Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been one of
the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying
out market reforms. With fits and starts, inflation has been lowered to
an estimated 7% in 2001. Much of the government's stock in enterprises
has been sold. Drops in production had been severe since the breakup
of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995 production began
to recover and exports began to increase. Growth was held down to
2.1% in 1998 largely because of the spillover from Russia's economic
difficulties, but moved ahead to 3.6% in 1999, 5% in 2000, and 5% again
in 2001. Despite these gains, poverty indicators are no better in 2001
than in 1996. On the positive side, the government and the international
financial institutions have embarked on a comprehensive medium-term
poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. In November 2001,
with financing assurance from the Paris Club, the IMF Board approved a
three-year, $93 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.

Korea, North

Introduction

Korea, North

Background:  Following World War II, Korea was split with the northern
half coming under Communist domination and the southern portion becoming
Western oriented. KIM Chong-il has ruled North Korea since his father
and the country's founder, president KIM Il-song, died in 1994. After
decades of mismanagement, the North relies heavily on international
food aid to feed its population, while continuing to expend resources
to maintain an army of about 1 million. North Korea's long-range missile
development and research into nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons
and massive conventional armed forces are of major concern to the
international community.

Economy Korea, North

Economy - overview:  North Korea, one of the world's most
centrally planned and isolated economies, faces desperate economic
conditions. Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a
result of years of underinvestment and spare parts shortages. Industrial
and power output have declined in parallel. Despite a good harvest in
2001, the nation faces its eighth year of food shortages because of
a lack of arable land; collective farming; weather-related problems,
including major drought in 2000; and chronic shortages of fertilizer
and fuel.  Massive international food aid deliveries have allowed the
regime to escape mass starvation since 1995-96, but the population
remains vulnerable to prolonged malnutrition and deteriorating living
conditions. Large-scale military spending eats up resources needed for
investment and civilian consumption. In 2001, the regime placed emphasis
on earning hard currency, developing information technology, addressing
power shortages, and attracting foreign aid, but in no way at the expense
of relinquishing central control over key national assets or undergoing
widespread market-oriented reforms.

Kiribati

Introduction

Kiribati

Background:  The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971
and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati. The
US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line
Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.

Geography Kiribati

Location:  Oceania, group of 33 coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean,
straddling the equator; the capital Tarawa is about one-half of the way
from Hawaii to Australia; note - on 1 January 1995, Kiribati proclaimed
that all of its territory lies in the same time zone as its Gilbert
Islands group (GMT +12) even though the Phoenix Islands and the Line
Islands under its jurisdiction lie on the other side of the International
Date Line

Geographic coordinates:  1 25 N, 173 00 E

Map references:  Oceania

Area:  total: 811 sq km note: includes three island groups - Gilbert
Islands, Line Islands, Phoenix Islands water: 0 sq km land: 811 sq km

Land boundaries:  0 km

Coastline:  1,143 km

Maritime claims:  exclusive economic zone: 200 NM territorial sea: 12 NM

Climate:  tropical; marine, hot and humid, moderated by trade winds

Terrain:  mostly low-lying coral atolls surrounded by extensive reefs

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point:
unnamed location on Banaba 81 m

Natural resources:  phosphate (production discontinued in 1979)

Land use:  arable land: 51% permanent crops: 0% other: 49% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  NA sq km

Natural hazards:  typhoons can occur any time, but usually November to
March; occasional tornadoes; low level of some of the islands make them
very sensitive to changes in sea level

Environment - current issues:  heavy pollution in lagoon of south Tarawa
atoll due to heavy migration mixed with traditional practices such as
lagoon latrines and open-pit dumping; ground water at risk

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Biodiversity, Climate
Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes,
Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection signed, but not ratified: none
of the selected agreements

Geography - note:  21 of the 33 islands are inhabited; Banaba (Ocean
Island) in Kiribati is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in
the Pacific Ocean - the others are Makatea in French Polynesia, and Nauru

Economy Kiribati

Economy - overview:  A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources.  Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The
economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development
is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure,
and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more than
one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an early stage of development
as is the expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial
aid, from UK, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and China, is a critical
supplement to GDP, equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.  Remittances
from workers abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

GDP:  purchasing power parity - $79 million (2001 est.), supplemented
by a nearly equal amount from external sources

GDP - real growth rate:  1.5% (2001 est.)

GDP - per capita:  purchasing power parity - $840 (2001 est.)

GDP - composition by sector:  agriculture: 30% industry: 7% services: 63%

Korea, South

Introduction

Korea, South

Background:  After World War II, a republic was set up in the southern
half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was
installed in the north. The Korean War (1950-53) had US and other UN
forces intervene to defend South Korea from North Korean attacks supported
by the Chinese. An armistice was signed in 1953 splitting the peninsula
along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter,
South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income far
outstripping the level of North Korea. In 1997, the nation suffered
a severe financial crisis from which it continues to make a solid
recovery. South Korea has also maintained its commitment to democratize
its political processes. In June 2000, a historic first south-north
summit took place between the south's President KIM Dae-jung and the
north's leader KIM Chong-il. In December 2000, President KIM Dae-jung
won the Noble Peace Prize for his lifelong commitment to democracy and
human rights in Asia. He is the first Korean to win a Nobel Prize.

Economy Korea, South

Economy - overview:  As one of the Four Tigers of East Asia, South
Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago
GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries
of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is seven times India's,
17 times North Korea's, and comparable to the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government/business ties, including directed credit,
import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong
labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings
and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-99
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
and an undisciplined financial sector. Growth plunged by 6.6% in 1998,
then strongly recovered to plus 10% in 1999 and 9% in 2000. Growth fell
back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy, falling
exports, and the perception that much-needed corporate and financial
reforms have stalled.

Economy Christmas Island

Economy - overview:  Phosphate mining had been the only significant
economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian Government
closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened. With the support of the
government, a $34 million casino opened in 1993. The casino closed in
1998. The Australian Government in 2001 agreed to support the creation
of a commercial space-launching site on the island, slated to begin
operation in 2003.

Economy Kuwait

Economy - overview:  Kuwait is a small, rich, relatively open
economy with proved crude oil reserves of 94 billion barrels - 10%
of world reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90%
of export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait's climate
limits agricultural development.  Consequently, with the exception of
fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of potable
water must be distilled or imported. Higher oil prices put the FY99/00
budget into a $2 billion surplus. The FY00/01 budget covers only nine
months because of a change in the fiscal year. The budget for FY01/02
envisioned higher expenditures for salaries, construction, and other
general categories. Kuwait continues its discussions with foreign oil
companies to develop fields in the northern part of the country.

Kazakhstan

Introduction

Kazakhstan

Background:  Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes
who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as a
single nation.  The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century and
Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s
agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to
help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants
(mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the
ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence
has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include:
the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
achieving a sustainable economic growth outside the oil, gas, and mining
sectors; and strengthening relations with neighboring states and other
foreign powers.

Geography Kazakhstan

Location:  Central Asia, northwest of China

Geographic coordinates:  48 00 N, 68 00 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 2,717,300 sq km water: 47,500 sq km land: 2,669,800 sq km

Area - comparative:  slightly less than four times the size of Texas

Land boundaries:  total: 12,012 km border countries: China 1,533 km,
Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846 km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan
2,203 km

Coastline:  0 km (landlocked); note - Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now
split into two bodies of water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)

Maritime claims:  none (landlocked)

Climate:  continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid

Terrain:  extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the
plains in western Siberia to oases and desert in Central Asia

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m highest point:

Land use:  arable land: 11% permanent crops: 0% other: 89% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  23,320 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  earthquakes in the south, mudslides around Almaty

Environment - current issues:  radioactive or toxic chemical sites
associated with its former defense industries and test ranges throughout
the country pose health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution
is severe in some cities; because the two main rivers which flowed into
the Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and
leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts;
these substances are then picked up by the wind and blown into noxious
dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse
of agricultural chemicals and salination from poor infrastructure and
wasteful irrigation practices

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Air Pollution,
Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species,
Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution signed, but not ratified: Climate
Change-Kyoto Protocol

Economy Kazakhstan

Economy - overview:  Kazakhstan, the largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil
fuel reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and
metals. It also is a large agricultural - livestock and grain -
producer. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction
and processing of these natural resources and also on a growing
machine-building sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors,
agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR
in December 1991 and the collapse in demand for Kazakhstan's traditional
heavy industry products resulted in a short-term contraction of the
economy, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97,
the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization
quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private
sector. Kazakhstan has enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01 thanks
largely to its booming energy sector, but also to economic reform, good
harvests, and foreign investment. The opening of the Caspian Consortium
pipeline in 2001, from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield to the
Black Sea, substantially raises export capacity. Astana has embarked
upon an industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away from
overdependence on the oil sector by developing light industry.

Economy Laos

Economy - overview:  The government of Laos - one of the few remaining
official Communist states - began decentralizing control and encouraging
private enterprise in 1986.  The results, starting from an extremely
low base, were striking - growth averaged 7% in 1988-2001 except during
the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis beginning
in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with a
primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road system,
and limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The economy will
continue to benefit from aid from the IMF and other international sources
and from new foreign investment in food-processing and mining.

Lebanon

Introduction

Lebanon

Background:  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
institutions since 1991 and the end of the devastating 16-year civil
war. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation
- the Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since the
end of the war, the Lebanese have conducted several successful elections,
most of the militias have been weakened or disbanded, and the Lebanese
Armed Forces (LAF) have extended central government authority over about
two-thirds of the country.  Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains
its weapons. Syria maintains about 20,000 troops in Lebanon based mainly
in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's troop deployment
was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's civil war and in
the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies its continued military presence
in Lebanon by citing Beirut's requests and the failure of the Lebanese
Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if
Accord. Israel's withdrawal from its security zone in southern Lebanon
in May of 2000, however, has emboldened some Lebanese Christians and
Druze to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well.

Economy Lebanon

Economy - overview:  The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking
hub. Peace enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery was helped by a financially sound banking
system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family
remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and
international aid provided the main sources of foreign exchange.
Lebanon's economy made impressive gains since the launch in 1993 of
"Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion reconstruction program. Real
GDP grew 8% in 1994, 7% in 1995, 4% in 1996 and in 1997 but slowed to 2%
in 1998, -1% in 1999, and -0.5% in 2000.  Growth recovered slightly in
2001 to 1%. During the 1990s annual inflation fell to almost 0% from more
than 100%. Lebanon has rebuilt much of its war-torn physical and financial
infrastructure.  The government nonetheless faces serious challenges in
the economic arena. It has funded reconstruction by borrowing heavily
- mostly from domestic banks. The re-installed HARIRI government has
failed to rein in the ballooning national debt. Without large-scale
international aid and rapid privatization of state-owned enterprises,
markets may force a currency devaluation and debt default in 2002.

Background:  After a brief period of independence between the two World
Wars, Latvia was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It reestablished its
independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although
the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the Russian minority
(some 30% of the population) remains of concern to Moscow. Latvia
continues to revamp its economy for eventual integration into various
Western European political and economic institutions.

Economy Latvia

Economy - overview:  Latvia's transitional economy recovered from the 1998
Russian financial crisis, largely due to the SKELE government's budget
stringency and a gradual reorientation of exports toward EU countries,
lessening Latvia's trade dependency on Russia. The majority of companies,
banks, and real estate have been privatized. Latvia officially joined
the World Trade Organization in February 1999 - the first Baltic state
to join - and was invited at the Helsinki EU Summit in December 1999 to
begin accession talks in early 2000. Preparing for EU membership over
the next few years remains a top foreign policy goal. The high current
account deficit remains a major concern.

Lithuania subsequently has restructured its economy for eventual
integration into Western European institutions.

Liberia

Introduction

Liberia

Background:  Seven years of civil strife were brought to a close in
1996 when free and open presidential and legislative elections were
held. President TAYLOR now holds strong executive power with no real
political opposition.  The years of fighting coupled with the flight of
most businesses have disrupted formal economic activity. A still unsettled
domestic security situation has slowed the process of rebuilding the
social and economic structure of this war-torn country. In 2001, the UN
imposed sanctions on Liberian diamonds along with an army embargo and
a travel ban on government officials for Liberia's support of the rebel
insurgency in Sierra Leone.

Economy Liberia

Economy - overview:  A civil war in 1989-96 destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
them. Some returned; many will not return. Richly endowed with water,
mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while
local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. The
democratically elected government, installed in August 1997, inherited
massive international debts and currently relies on revenues from its
maritime registry and timber industry to provide the bulk of its foreign
exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising
of incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the implementation of sound
macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government, including
the encouragement of foreign investment.  Recent growth has been from a
low base, and continued growth will require major policy successes and
containment of armed rebellion.

Slovakia

Introduction

Slovakia

Background:  In 1918 the Slovaks joined the closely related Czechs to form
Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II, Czechoslovakia became
a Communist nation within Soviet-ruled Eastern Europe. Soviet influence
collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks
and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Historic,
political, and geographic factors have caused Slovakia to experience
more difficulty in developing a modern market economy than some of its
Central European neighbors.

hands, and foreign investment has picked up. Slovakia's economy exceeded
expectations in 2001, despite recession in key export markets. Revival
of domestic demand, partly due to a rise in real wages, offset slowing
export growth to help drive the economy to its strongest expansion since
1998. Solid domestic demand is expected to boost economic growth to 3.4%
in 2002, and about 4% in 2003. Unemployment, rising to 19.8% at the end
of 2001, remained the economy's Achilles' heel.  The government faces
other strong challenges in 2002, especially the maintenance of fiscal
balance ahead of the September 2002 parliamentary election, cutting
budget and current account deficits, and privatization of the Slovak
energy and power monopolies.

which is now privately owned by the Nature Conservancy. This organization
is managing the atoll as a nature preserve. The lagoons and surrounding

Liechtenstein

Introduction

Liechtenstein

Background:  The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within
the Holy Roman Empire in 1719; it became a sovereign state in 1806. Until
the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic
devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to conclude
a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II
(in which Liechtenstein remained neutral) the country's low taxes have
spurred outstanding economic growth. However, shortcomings in banking
regulatory oversight have resulted in concerns about the use of the
financial institutions for money laundering.

Economy Liechtenstein

Economy - overview:  Despite its small size and limited natural resources,
Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized,
free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and
living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large European
neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 18% - and easy
incorporation rules have induced 73,700 holding or so-called letter box
companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30%
of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with
Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It
imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has
been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as
a bridge between European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and EU) since
May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

Economy Lesotho

Economy - overview:  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's
primary natural resource is water. Its economy is based on subsistence
agriculture, livestock, remittances from miners employed in South Africa,
and a rapidly growing apparel-assembly sector. The number of mineworkers
has declined steadily over the past several years. A small manufacturing
base depends largely on farm products that support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries. Agricultural products are exported primarily
to South Africa. Proceeds from membership in a common customs union with
South Africa form the majority of government revenue. Although drought has
decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, completion of a
major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits the sale of water to
South Africa, generating royalties for Lesotho. The pace of privatization
has increased in recent years. In December 1999, the government embarked
on a nine-month IMF staff-monitored program aimed at structural adjustment
and stabilization of macroeconomic fundamentals. The government is in
the process of applying for a three-year successor program with the IMF
under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Lesotho has a marked
inequality in income distribution and serious unemployment/underemployment
problems that will not yield to short-run solutions.

Luxembourg

Background:  Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half
of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in
both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into
the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the
European Economic Community (later the European Union) and in 1999 it
joined the euro currency area.

Economy Luxembourg

Economy - overview:  This stable, high-income economy features solid
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial sector,
initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to
include chemicals, rubber, and other products. Growth in the financial
sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
especially banking, account for a substantial proportion of the
economy. Agriculture is based on small family-owned farms. The economy
depends on foreign and trans-border workers for 30% of its labor
force. Although Luxembourg, like all EU members, has suffered from the
global economic slump, the country has maintained a fairly robust growth
rate. On 1 January 2002, Luxembourg - together with 11 of its EU partners
- began to replace its circulating national currency with the euro.

Libya

Introduction

Libya

Background:  Since he took power in a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar Abu
Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system - a combination
of socialism and Islam - which he calls the Third International
Theory. Viewing himself as a revolutionary leader, he used oil funds
during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya,
even supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of
Marxism and capitalism. Libyan military adventures failed, e.g., the
prolonged foray of Libyan troops into the Aozou Strip in northern Chad
was finally repulsed in 1987. Libyan support for terrorism decreased
after UN sanctions were imposed in 1992. Those sanctions were suspended
in April 1999.

Economy Libya

Economy - overview:  The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon
revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export
earnings and about one-quarter of GDP. These oil revenues and a small
population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa, but
little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society. Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded
from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production
of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and
poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about
75% of its food.  Higher oil prices in 1999 and 2000 led to an increase
in export revenues, which improved macroeconomic balances and helped
to stimulate the economy. The suspension of UN sanctions in 1999 also
boosted growth. Libya's January 2002 51% devaluation of the official
exchange rate of the dinar is another fiscal plus, although it will also
bring higher inflation.

Madagascar

Background:  Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French
colony in 1886, but regained its independence in 1960. During 1992-93,
free presidential and National Assembly elections were held, ending 17
years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race,
Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned
to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between
the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing
secession of half of the country. In April 2002 the High Constitutional
Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner.

Economy Madagascar

Economy - overview:  Madagascar faces problems of chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied by
erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay
of the economy, accounting for one-third of GDP and contributing more
than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile manufacturing and
the processing of agricultural products. Growth in output in 1992-97
averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been
held back by antigovernment strikes and demonstrations, a decline in
world coffee prices, and the erratic commitment of the government to
economic reform. The extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants of future growth.

Economy Martinique

Economy - overview:  The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism,
and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports
are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable,
and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic
trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.
Tourism, which employs more than 11,000 people, has become more important
than agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority
of the work force is employed in the service sector and in administration.

Economy Macau

Economy - overview:  Macau's economy two years after reversion to China
remains one of the most open in the world, according to the World
Trade Organization. The government collects no duty on imports and
sets no restrictions on exports beyond those required by international
agreements. The territory's net exports of goods and services account
for 35% of GDP, with tourism and apparel exports as the mainstays. The
territory therefore has been hit hard by the 2001 downturn in its key US
and EU export markets. Tourism remained strong, however, driven by a surge
in visitors from mainland China. In response to the expected contraction
of the economy in 2002, the government has announced a stimulative
income tax cut and public works program that will push the budget into
deficit. China already has extended support by easing restrictions on
travel to Macau and is proposing a China-Hong Kong-Macau free trade
area. China's economic weight is increasingly felt, with the mainland
now holding more than 50% of assets in the financial, real estate,
and construction sectors.  Mainlanders, however, have been excluded
from bidding on the gambling industry licenses that Macau is offering
to break up the territory's four-decade-old gambling monopoly. Gambling
taxes account for up to 60% of revenue, and the government with Beijing's
backing intends to revitalize the industry.

Economy Moldova

Economy - overview:  Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good
farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy
depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,
and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to sharp
production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. As
part of an ambitious reform effort, Moldova introduced a convertible
currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state
enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls,
and freed interest rates. Yet these efforts could not offset the impact
of political and economic difficulties, both internal and regional. In
1998, the economic troubles of Russia, by far Moldova's leading trade
partner, were a major cause of the 8.6% drop in GDP. In 1999, GDP fell
again, by 4.4%, the fifth drop in the past seven years; exports were
down, and energy supplies continued to be erratic. Following the return
to positive GDP growth in 2000 (1.9%), Moldova experienced strong 6.1%
rise in GDP in 2001, driven by a marked improvement in industry and a 20%
improvement in agriculture.

Mongolia

Introduction

Mongolia

Background:  The Mongols entered history in the 13th century when under
GENGHIS KHAN they conquered a huge Eurasian empire. After his death
the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these
broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their
original steppe homelands and came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its
independence in 1921 with Soviet backing. A Communist regime was installed
in 1924. During the early 1990s, the ex-Communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) gradually yielded its monopoly on power to the
Democratic Union Coalition (DUC), which defeated the MPRP in a national
election in 1996. Over the next four years the DUC put forward a number
of key reforms to modernize the economy and democratize the political
system. However, the former Communists were a strong opposition that
stalled additional restructuring and made implementation difficult. In
2000, the MPRP won an overwhelming victory in the legislature - with 72
of the 76 seats - and completely reshuffled the government. While it
continues many of the reform policies, the MPRP is focusing on social
welfare and public order priorities.

Economy Mongolia

Economy - overview:  Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and breeding of livestock. Mongolia also has extensive
mineral deposits: copper, coal, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
account for a large part of industrial production. Soviet assistance,
at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990-91,
at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. Mongolia was driven into
deep recession, prolonged by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's
(MPRP) reluctance to undertake serious economic reform. The Democratic
Coalition (DC) government has embraced free-market economics, easing price
controls, liberalizing domestic and international trade, and attempting
to restructure the banking system and the energy sector. Major domestic
privatization programs were undertaken, as well as the fostering of
foreign investment through international tender of the oil distribution
company, a leading cashmere company, and banks. Reform was held back by
the ex-Communist MPRP opposition and by the political instability brought
about through four successive governments under the DC.  Economic growth
picked up in 1997-99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of natural
disasters and declines in world prices of copper and cashmere. In August
and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban
on exports of oil and oil products, and Mongolia remains vulnerable
in this sector. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTrO)
in 1997. The international donor community pledged over $300 million
per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar
in June 1999. The MPRP government, elected in July 2000, is anxious to
improve the investment climate; it must also deal with a heavy burden
of external debt. Falling prices for Mongolia's mainly primary sector
exports, widespread opposition to privatization, and adverse effects of
weather on agriculture in early 2000 and 2001 restrained real GDP growth
in 2000-01.

Economy Montserrat

Economy - overview:  Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995,
has put a damper on this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in
June 1997 closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic and
social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island.
Some began to return in 1998, but lack of housing limited the number. The
agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land
for farming and the destruction of crops.  Prospects for the economy
depend largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public
sector construction activity.  The UK has launched a three-year $122.8
million aid program to help reconstruct the economy. Half of the island
is expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade.

Economy Malawi

Economy - overview:  Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least
developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural,
with about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for 40% of GDP and 88% of export revenues. The economy depends
on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World
Bank, and individual donor nations. In late 2000, Malawi was approved
for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. The
government faces strong challenges, e.g., to fully develop a market
economy, to improve educational facilities, to face up to environmental
problems, and to deal with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS.
The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth.

Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Introduction

Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Background:  International recognition of The Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia's (F.Y.R.O.M.) independence from Yugoslavia in 1991
was delayed by Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it
considered a Hellenic name and symbols. Greece finally lifted its
trade blockade in 1995, and the two countries agreed to normalize
relations, despite continued disagreement over F.Y.R.O.M.'s use of
"Macedonia." F.Y.R.O.M.'s large Albanian minority, an ethnic Albanian
armed insurgency in F.Y.R.O.M. in 2001, and the status of neighboring
Kosovo continue to be sources of ethnic tension.

Economy Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Economy - overview:  At independence in November 1991, Macedonia was the
least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the
total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia
ended transfer payments from the center and eliminated advantages from
inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN
sanctions on Yugoslavia, one of its largest markets, and a Greek economic
embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag
hindered economic growth until 1996. GDP subsequently rose each year
through 2000. However, the leadership's commitment to economic reform,
free trade, and regional integration was undermined by the ethnic Albanian
insurgency of 2001. The economy shrank about 4% because of decreased
trade, intermittent border closures, increased deficit spending on
security needs, and investor uncertainty. The international community
hopes to restart growth with a donors' conference in 2002.

Mali

Introduction

Mali

Background:  The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of
France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a
few months, the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship
was brought to a close in 1991 with a transitional government, and in 1992
when Mali's first democratic presidential election was held.  Since his
reelection in 1997, President KONARE continued to push through political
and economic reforms and to fight corruption. In 1999 he indicated he
would not run for a third term, in keeping with the Malian constitution's
two-term limit.

Economy Mali

Economy - overview:  Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 70% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing.  Industrial activity is concentrated
on processing farm commodities.  Mali is heavily dependent on foreign
aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful implementation
of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that is helping
the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's
adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the African
franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a sturdy 5%
average in 1996-2000. In 2001, GDP decreased by 1.2% mainly due to a 50%
drop in cotton production in 2000-01.

Economy Monaco

Economy - overview:  Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean
coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino
and pleasant climate. In 2001, a major new construction project
will extend the pier used by cruise ships in the main harbor. The
Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and
small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no
income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies
that have set up businesses and offices. The state retains monopolies
in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and
the postal service.  Living standards are high, roughly comparable to
those in prosperous French metropolitan areas. Monaco does not publish

Introduction

Morocco

Background:  Morocco's long struggle for independence from France ended
in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier was turned over to the new
country that same year. Morocco virtually annexed Western Sahara during
the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the territory
remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in
the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997.

Economy Morocco

Economy - overview:  Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries - restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and achieving sustainable economic
growth. Following structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF,
World Bank, and the Paris Club, the dirham is now fully convertible for
current account transactions, and reforms of the financial sector have
been implemented. Droughts depressed activity in the key agricultural
sector and contributed to a stagnant economy in 1999 and 2000.  During
that time, however, Morocco reported large foreign exchange inflows from
the sale of a mobile telephone license and partial privatization of the
state-owned telecommunications company.  Favorable rainfall in 2001 led
to a growth of 5%. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing
the external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU;
and improving education and attracting foreign investment to boost living
standards and job prospects for Morocco's youth.

Transnational Issues Morocco

Disputes - international:  claims and administers Western Sahara, but
sovereignty remains unresolved; UN-administered cease-fire has remained in
effect since September 1991, but attempts to hold a referendum have failed
and parties reject other proposals; Spain controls three small possessions
off the coast of Morocco - the islands of Penon de Alhucemas, Penon de
Velez de la Gomera, and Islas Chafarinas and two autonomous communities
on the coast of Morrocco - Ceuta and Mellila; Morocco rejected Spain's
unilateral designation of a median line from the Canary Islands in 2002 to
explore undersea resources and to interdict illegal refugees from Africa

Illicit drugs:  illicit producer of hashish; trafficking increasing
for both domestic and international drug markets; shipments of hashish
mostly directed to Western Europe; transit point for cocaine from South
America destined for Western Europe

Introduction

Mauritius

Background:  Discovered by the Portuguese in 1505, Mauritius was
subsequently held by the Dutch, French, and British before independence
was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and
a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable
foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita
incomes. Recent poor weather and declining sugar prices have slowed
economic growth leading to some protests over standards of living in
the Creole community.

Economy Mauritius

Economy - overview:  Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed
from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist
sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 5%
to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable
income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality,
and a much improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90%
of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The
government's development strategy centers on foreign investment. Mauritius
has attracted more than 9,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce
in India and South Africa, and investment in the banking sector alone
has reached over $1 billion.  Mauritius, with its strong textile sector
and responsible fiscal management, was well-poised to take advantage of
the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

Midway Islands

Introduction

Midway Islands

Background:  The US took formal possession of the islands in 1867. The
laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through the islands,
brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and 1947, Midway was
used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights. The US naval victory
over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the turning points
of World War II. The islands continued to serve as a naval station until
closed in 1993. Today the islands are a national wildlife refuge. From
1996 to 2001 the refuge was open to the public. It is now temporarily
closed.

Mauritania

Introduction

Mauritania

Background:  Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Opposition
parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in 1991. Two
multiparty presidential elections since then were widely seen as flawed,
but October 2001 legislative and municipal elections were generally
free and open. Mauritania remains, in reality, a one-party state.
The country continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black
minority population and the dominant Maur (Arab-Berber) populace.

Economy Mauritania

Economy - overview:  Half the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts
in the 1970s and 1980s.  Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron
ore, which account for half of total exports. The decline in world
demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The
nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the
world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source
of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott
in 1986. In the past, drought and economic mismanagement resulted in
a buildup of foreign debt. In February, 2000, Mauritania qualified for
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative
and in December 2001 received strong support from donor and lending
countries at a triennial Consultative Group review. Mauritania withdrew
its membership in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
in 2000 and subsequently increased commercial ties with Arab Maghreb
Union members Morocco and Tunisia, most notably in telecommunications. In
2001, exploratory oil wells in tracts 80 km offshore indicated potential
viable extraction at current world oil prices. However, the refinery in
Nouadhibou historically has not exceeded 20% of its distillation capacity,
and it handled no crude in the year 2000. A new Investment Code approved
in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment.

Economy Maldives

Economy - overview:  Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts
for 20% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. Almost 400,000 tourists visited the islands in
1998. Fishing is a second leading sector. The Maldivian Government began
an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import quotas
and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently, it has
liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and
manufacturing continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by
the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic
labor. Most staple foods must be imported.  Industry, which consists
mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts, accounts
for about 18% of GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of
erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80%
of the area is one meter or less above sea level.

Mexico

Introduction

Mexico

Background:  The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came
under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence
early in the 19th century.  A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw
Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in over half
a century. The nation continues to make an impressive recovery. Ongoing
economic and social concerns include low real wages, underemployment for
a large segment of the population, inequitable income distribution, and
few advancement opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the
impoverished southern states. Elections held in July 2000 marked the first
time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that the opposition defeated the
party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Vicente
FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) was sworn in on 1 December 2000
as the first chief executive elected in free and fair elections.

Economy Mexico

Economy - overview:  Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by
the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition
in seaports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural
gas distribution, and airports. Income distribution remains highly
unequal. Trade with the US and Canada has tripled since the implementation
of NAFTA in 1994. Following 6.9% growth in 2000, real GDP fell 0.3% in
2001, with the US slowdown the principal cause. Positive developments in
2001 included a drop in inflation to 6.5%, a sharp fall in interest rates,
and a strong peso that appreciated 5% against the dollar.  Mexico City
implemented free trade agreements with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador,
and the European Free Trade Area in 2001, putting more than 90% of
trade under free trade agreements. Foreign direct investment reached
$25 billion in 2001, of which $12.5 billion came from the purchase of
Mexico's second largest bank, Banamex, by Citigroup.

Economy Malaysia

Economy - overview:  Malaysia, a middle income country, transformed itself
from 1971 through the late 1990s from a producer of raw materials into
an emerging multi-sector economy. Growth is almost exclusively driven
by exports - particularly of electronics - and, as a result Malaysia was
hard hit by the global economic downturn and the slump in the Information
Technology (IT) sector in 2001. GDP in 2001 grew only 0.3% due to an
estimated 11% contraction in exports, but a substantial fiscal stimulus
package has mitigated the worst of the recession and the economy is
expected to grow by 2% to 3% in 2002 as the world economy rebounds. Kuala
Lumpur's healthy foreign exchange reserves and relatively small external
debt make it unlikely that Malaysia will experience a crisis similar
to the crisis of 1997, but the economy remains vulnerable to a more
protracted downturn in the US and Japan, top export destinations and
key sources of foreign investment.

Mozambique

Introduction

Mozambique

Background:  Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close
with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration by whites, economic
dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war
hindered the country's development. The ruling party formally abandoned
Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for
multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace
agreement with rebel forces ended the fighting in 1992.

Economy Mozambique

Economy - overview:  At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the
world's poorest countries.  Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil
war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1988, the government
embarked on a series of dramatic macroeconomic reforms designed to
stabilize the economy and reduce government participation. These steps
combined with the political stability that has prevailed since the
1994 multi-party elections have led to dramatic improvements in the
country's growth rate fueled by foreign and domestic investments and
donor assistance. Inflation was brought to single digits during the
same period, although it has returned to double digits in 2000 and
2001. Foreign exchange rates have remained relatively stable.  Fiscal
reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of
the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection
abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remains dependent upon
foreign assistance for much of its annual budget, and the majority of
the population remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture
continues to employ the vast majority of the country's workforce. A
substantial trade imbalance persists, although it has diminished
with the opening of the MOZAL aluminum smelter, the country's largest
foreign investment project.  Additional investment projects in titanium
extraction/processing and garment manufacturing should further close the
import/export gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been
reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is
now at a manageable level.

Economy New Caledonia

Economy - overview:  New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known
nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered because of
depressed international demand for nickel, the principal source of export
earnings. Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation,
and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel,
the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys
to the health of the economy. The situation in 1998 was clouded by
the spillover of financial problems in East Asia and by lower prices
for nickel.  Nickel prices jumped in 1999-2000, and large additions
were made to capacity. Strikes in the building industry in 2001, which
lasted four months, adversely affected many other sectors of the economy.
French Government interests in the New Caledonian nickel industry are
being transferred to local ownership.

Niue

Introduction

Niue

Background:  Niue's remoteness, as well as cultural and linguistic
differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest
of the Cook Islands, have caused it to be separately administered. The
population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5,200 in
1966 to about 2,100 in 2002) with substantial emigration to New Zealand,
2,400 km to the southwest.

Economy Niue

Economy - overview:  The economy suffers from the typical Pacific
island problems of geographic isolation, few resources, and a small
population. Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the
shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that
are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government
expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The
agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although
some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of
small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut
cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important
source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss
of population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand. Efforts to
increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and a financial services
industry, although Premier LAKATANI announced in February 2002 that
Niue will shut down the offshore banking industry. Economic aid from
New Zealand in 2002 will be about $2.6 million.

Economy Niger

Economy - overview:  Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, because of declining
world demand. The 50% devaluation of the West African franc in January
1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of
Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral and
multilateral aid - which was suspended following the April 1999 coup
d'etat - for operating expenses and public investment. In 2000-01, the
World Bank approved a structural adjustment loan of $105 million to help
support fiscal reforms. However, reforms could prove difficult given the
government's bleak financial situation.  The IMF approved a $73 million
poverty reduction and growth facility for Niger in 2000 and announced
$115 million in debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative.

Economy Vanuatu

Economy - overview:  The economy is based primarily on subsistence
or small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about
50,000 visitors in 1997, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral
deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A
small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues
come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by
dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural
disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent
islands. A severe earthquake in November 1999 followed by a tsunami,
caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecote and left
thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused
extensive damage in the capital, Port-Vila, and surrounding areas,
and also was followed by a tsunami. GDP growth has risen less than 3%
on average in the 1990s. In response to foreign concerns, the government
has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center.

Nigeria

Background:  Following nearly 16 years of military rule, a new
constitution was adopted in 1999, and a peaceful transition to civilian
government was completed. The president faces the daunting task of
rebuilding a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered
through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In
addition, the OBASANJO administration must defuse longstanding ethnic
and religious tensions, if it is to build a sound foundation for economic
growth and political stability.

Economy Nigeria

Economy - overview:  The oil-rich Nigerian economy, long hobbled by
political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic management,
is undergoing substantial economic reform under the new civilian
administration.  Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify
the economy away from overdependence on the capital-intensive oil
sector, which provides 20% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings,
and about 65% of budgetary revenues. The largely subsistence agricultural
sector has failed to keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria,
once a large net exporter of food, now must import food.  Following the
signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000, Nigeria received a
debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from
the IMF, both contingent on economic reforms. The agreement was allowed to
expire by the IMF in November 2001, however, and Nigeria appears unlikely
to receive substantial multilateral assistance in 2002. Nonetheless,
increases in foreign oil investment and oil production should push growth
over 4% in 2002.

Economy Netherlands

Economy - overview:  The Netherlands is a prosperous and open
economy depending heavily on foreign trade. The economy is noted for
stable industrial relations, moderate inflation, a sizable current
account surplus, and an important role as a European transportation
hub. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals,
petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized
agricultural sector employs no more than 4% of the labor force but
provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for
exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began
circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country continues
to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct
investment. Economic growth slowed considerably in 2001, as part of the
global economic slowdown, but for the four years before that, annual
growth averaged nearly 4%, well above the EU average.

Introduction

Norway

Background:  Despite its neutrality, Norway was not able to avoid
occupation by Germany in World War II. In 1949, neutrality was abandoned
and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent
waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current
focus is on containing spending on the extensive welfare system and
planning for the time when petroleum reserves are depleted. In referenda
held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.

Economy Norway

Economy - overview:  The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of
welfare capitalism, featuring a combination of free market activity and
government intervention.  The government controls key areas, such as
the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises). The
country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,
fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil
production and international oil prices; in 1999, oil and gas accounted
for 35% of exports. Only Saudi Arabia and Russia export more oil than
Norway. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November
1994. Growth picked up in 2000 to 2.7%, compared with the meager 0.8%
of 1999, but fell back to 1.3% in 2001. The government moved ahead with
privatization in 2000, even proposing the sale of up to one-third of the
100% state-owned oil company Statoil. With arguably the highest quality
of life worldwide, Norwegians still worry about that time in the next two
decades when the oil and gas begin to run out. Accordingly, Norway has
been saving its oil-boosted budget surpluses in a Government Petroleum
Fund, which is invested abroad and now is valued at more than $43 billion.

Economy Nepal

Economy - overview:  Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with nearly half of its population living below
the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing
a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting for 41% of
GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural
produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Textile and carpet
production, accounteing for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in
recent years, contracted significantly in 2001 due to the overall slowdown
in the world economy and pressures by Maoist insurgents on factory
owners and workers. Security concerns in the wake of Maoist activity,
the June massacre of many members of the royal family, and the September
11 terrorist attacks in the US led to a decrease in tourism, another key
source of foreign exchange. Agricultural production is growing by about
5% on average as compared with annual population growth of 2.3%. Since
May 1991, the government has been moving forward with economic reforms,
particularly those that encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g.,
by reducing business licenses and registration requirements to simplify
investment procedures. The government has also been cutting expenditures
by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off
civil servants. More recently, however, political instability - five
different governments over the past few years - has hampered Kathmandu's
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms. Nepal has
considerable scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting its
potential in hydropower and tourism, areas of recent foreign investment
interest. Prospects for foreign trade or investment in other sectors
will remain poor, however, because of the small size of the economy,
its technological backwardness, its remoteness, its landlocked geographic
location, and its susceptibility to natural disaster.  The international
community's role of funding more than 60% of Nepal's development budget
and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures will likely continue
as a major ingredient of growth.

Nauru

Introduction

Nauru

Background:  Nauru's phosphate deposits began to be mined early in the
20th century by a German-British consortium; the island was occupied by
Australian forces in World War I. Nauru achieved independence in 1968 and
joined the UN in 1999. Nauru is the world's smallest independent republic.

Environment - current issues:  limited natural fresh water resources, roof
storage tanks collect rainwater, but mostly dependent on a single, aging
desalination plant; intensive phosphate mining during the past 90 years -
mainly by a UK, Australia, and NZ consortium - has left the central 90%
of Nauru a wasteland and threatens limited remaining land resources

Economy Nauru

Economy - overview:  Revenues of this tiny island have come from
exports of phosphates, but reserves are expected to be exhausted within
a few years. Phosphate production has declined since 1989, as demand has
fallen in traditional markets and as the marginal cost of extracting the
remaining phosphate increases, making it less internationally competitive.
While phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World, few other resources exist with most necessities being
imported, including fresh water from Australia.  The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's
phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income have been
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for
Nauru's economic future. The government has been borrowing heavily from
the trusts to finance fiscal deficits. To cut costs the government has
called for a freeze on wages, a reduction of over-staffed public service
departments, privatization of numerous government agencies, and closure
of some overseas consulates. In recent years Nauru has encouraged the
registration of offshore banks and corporations.  Tens of billions of
dollars have been channeled through their accounts. Few comprehensive
statistics on the Nauru economy exist, with estimates of Nauru's per
capita GDP varying widely.

Suriname

Introduction

Suriname

Background:  Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five
years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime
that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to rule through
a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when
international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1989, the
military overthrew the civilian government, but a democratically-elected
government returned to power in 1991.

Economy Suriname

Economy - overview:  The economy is dominated by the bauxite
industry, which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export
earnings. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend
on renewed commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and
to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and
promote competition.  The government of Ronald VENETIAAN has begun an
austerity program, raised taxes, and attempted to control spending. The
Dutch Government has restarted the aid flow, which will allow Suriname
to access international development financing.

Nicaragua

Introduction

Nicaragua

Background:  Settled as a colony of Spain in the 1520s, Nicaragua
gained its independence in 1821.  Violent opposition to governmental
manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted
in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas
to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused
the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the
1980s. Free elections in 1990, 1996, and again in 2001 saw the Sandinistas
defeated. The country has slowly rebuilt its economy during the 1990s,
but was hard hit by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

Economy Nicaragua

Economy - overview:  Nicaragua, one of the hemisphere's poorest countries,
faces low per capita income, flagging socio-economic indicators, and huge
external debt.  Distribution of income is extremely unequal. While the
country has made progress toward macroeconomic stabilization over the past
few years, a banking crisis and scandal has shaken the economy. Managua
will continue to be dependent on international aid and debt relief under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Donors have made
aid conditional on improving governability, the openness of government
financial operation, poverty alleviation, and human rights. Nicaragua
met the conditions for additional debt service relief in December
2000. Growth should move up in 2002 because of increased private
investment and recovery in the global economy.

Economy New Zealand

Economy - overview:  Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, transforming New Zealand from an agrarian economy
dependent on concessionary British market access to a more industrialized,
free market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes (but left behind many at the bottom of the ladder),
broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial
sector, and contained inflationary pressures. While per capita incomes
have been rising, however, they remain below the level of the four largest
EU economies, and there is some government concern that New Zealand is not
closing the gap. New Zealand is heavily dependent on trade - particularly
in agricultural products - to drive growth, and it has been affected by
the global economic slowdown and the slump in commodity prices.  Thus far
the New Zealand economy has been relatively resilient, achieving about
3% growth in 2001, but the New Zealand business cycle tends to lag the
US cycle by about six months, so the worst of the downturn may not hit
until mid-2002.

Southern Ocean

Introduction

Southern Ocean

Background:  A decision by the International Hydrographic Organization
in the spring of 2000 delimited a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean
- from the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and
Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica
north to 60 degrees south latitude, which coincides with the Antarctic
Treaty Limit. The Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's
five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean,
but larger than the Arctic Ocean).

Geography Southern Ocean

Location:  body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and Antarctica

Geographic coordinates:  65 00 S, 0 00 E (nominally), but the Southern
Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of
water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica; this ring of water
lies between 60 degrees south latitude and the coast of Antarctica,
and encompasses 360 degrees of longitude

Map references:  Antarctic Region

Area:  total: 20.327 million sq km note: includes Amundsen Sea,
Bellingshausen Sea, part of the Drake Passage, Ross Sea, a small part
of the Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:  slightly more than twice the size of the US

Coastline:  17,968 km

Climate:  sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to -2
degrees Celsius; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent
and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between
ice and open ocean; the ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the
Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth;
in winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the
Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector,
lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius; at some
coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep
the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter

Terrain:  the Southern Ocean is deep, 4,000 to 5,000 meters over most
of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water; the Antarctic
continental shelf is generally narrow and unusually deep - its edge
lying at depths of 400 to 800 meters (the global mean is 133 meters);
the Antarctic icepack grows from an average minimum of 2.6 million square
kilometers in March to about 18.8 million square kilometers in September,
better than a sixfold increase in area; the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
(21,000 km in length) moves perpetually eastward; it is the world's
largest ocean current, transporting 130 million cubic meters of water
per second - 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: -7,235 m at the southern end of the
South Sandwich Trench highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:  probable large and possible giant oil and gas fields
on the continental margin, manganese nodules, possible placer deposits,
sand and gravel, fresh water as icebergs, squid, whales, and seals -
none exploited; krill, fishes

Natural hazards:  huge icebergs with drafts up to several hundred meters;
smaller bergs and iceberg fragments; sea ice (generally 0.5 to 1 meter
thick) with sometimes dynamic short-term variations and with large
annual and interannual variations; deep continental shelf floored by
glacial deposits varying widely over short distances; high winds and
large waves much of the year; ship icing, especially May-October; most
of region is remote from sources of search and rescue

Environment - current issues:  increased solar ultraviolet radiation
resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole in recent years, reducing marine
primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and damaging
the DNA of some fish; illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in
recent years, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times
more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, which is likely
to affect the sustainability of the stock; large amount of incidental
mortality of seabirds resulting from long-line fishing for toothfish note:
the now-protected fur seal population is making a strong comeback after
severe overexploitation in the 18th and 19th centuries

Environment - international agreements:  the Southern Ocean is subject to
all international agreements regarding the world's oceans; in addition,
it is subject to these agreements specific to the Antarctic region:
International Whaling Commission (prohibits commercial whaling south
of 40 degrees south [south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and
130 degrees west]); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals
(limits sealing); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (regulates fishing) note: many nations (including the
US) prohibit mineral resource exploration and exploitation south of the
fluctuating Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence) which is in the middle
of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line
between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer
waters to the north

Geography - note:  the major chokepoint is the Drake Passage between
South America and Antarctica; the Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence)
is the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern
Ocean; it is a distinct region at the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current that separates the very cold polar surface waters to the south
from the warmer waters to the north; the Front and the Current extend
entirely around Antarctica, reaching south of 60 degrees south near New
Zealand and near 48 degrees south in the far South Atlantic coinciding
with the path of the maximum westerly winds

People Southern Ocean

Population growth rate:  NA%

Economy Southern Ocean

Economy - overview:  Fisheries in 2000-01 (1 July to 30 June)
landed 112,934 metric tons, of which 87% was krill and 11% Patagonian
toothfish. International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to reduce
illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 2000-01 season
landed, by one estimate, 8,376 metric tons of Patagonian and antarctic
toothfish. In the 2000-01 antarctic summer 12,248 tourists, most of them
seaborne, visited the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, compared to 14,762
the previous year.

Transportation Southern Ocean

Ports and harbors:  McMurdo, Palmer, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica
note: few ports or harbors exist on the southern side of the Southern
Ocean; ice conditions limit use of most of them to short periods in
midsummer; even then some cannot be entered without icebreaker escort;
most antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and,
except in an emergency, are not open to commercial or private vessels;
vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection
by Antarctic Treaty observers (see Article 7)

Transportation - note:  Drake Passage offers alternative to transit
through the Panama Canal

Transnational Issues Southern Ocean

Disputes - international:  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctica
entry), but Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway,
and UK assert claims (some overlapping), including the continental
shelf in the Southern Ocean; several states have expressed an interest
in extending those continental shelf claims under the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS) to include undersea ridges; the
US and most other states do not recognize the land or maritime claims
of other states and have made no claims themselves (the US and Russia
have reserved the right to do so); no formal claims have been made in
the sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west

Paraguay

Introduction

Paraguay

Background:  In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70),
Paraguay lost two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory. It
stagnated economically for the next half century. In the Chaco War of
1932-35, large, economically important areas were won from Bolivia.
The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER was overthrown
in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in political infighting in recent
years, relatively free and regular presidential elections have been held
since then.

Economy Paraguay

Economy - overview:  Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector. The informal sector features both reexport of imported
consumer goods to neighboring countries as well as the activities of
thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. Because of
the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are
difficult to obtain. A large percentage of the population derives their
living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. The
formal economy grew by an average of about 3% annually in 1995-97, but
GDP declined slightly in 1998, 1999, and 2000. On a per capita basis, real
income has stagnated at 1980 levels. Most observers attribute Paraguay's
poor economic performance to political uncertainty, corruption, lack of
progress on structural reform, substantial internal and external debt,
and deficient infrastructure.

Introduction

Pitcairn Islands

Background:  Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the British
and settled in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian
companions. Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become a British
colony (in 1838) and today remains the last vestige of that empire in
the South Pacific.  Outmigration, primarily to New Zealand, has thinned
the population from a peak of 233 in 1937 to less than 50 today.

Peru

Introduction

Peru

Background:  Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean
civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by
the Spanish conquistadores in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared
in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824. After a dozen
years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in
1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent
insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in
a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant
progress in curtailing guerrilla activity.  Nevertheless, the president's
increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the
late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime. FUJIMORI
won reelection to a third term in the spring of 2000, but international
pressure and corruption scandals led to his ouster by Congress in November
of that year. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring
of 2001, which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO as the new head of government.

Government Peru

Country name:  conventional long form: Republic of Peru conventional short
form: Peru local long form: Republica del Peru local short form: Peru

Government type:  constitutional republic

Capital:  Lima

Administrative divisions:  24 departments (departamentos, singular -
departamento) and 1 constitutional province* (provincia constitucional);
Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco,
Huancavelica, Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto,
Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura, Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes,
Ucayali note: the 1979 constitution mandated the creation of regions
(regiones, singular - region) to function eventually as autonomous
economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
constituted from 23 of the 24 departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres
Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa),
Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre
de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari
(from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui (from Moquegua, Tacna,
Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas),
San Martin (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another
region has been delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional province
of Callao to merge with the department of Lima; because of inadequate
funding from the central government and organizational and political
difficulties, the regions have yet to assume major responsibilities;
the 1993 constitution retains the regions but limits their authority;
the 1993 constitution also reaffirms the roles of departmental and
municipal governments

Economy Peru

Economy - overview:  Thanks to strong foreign investment and the
cooperation between the government and the IMF and World Bank, growth
was strong in 1994-97 and inflation was brought under control. In 1998,
El Nino's impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and
instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. And 1999 was another
lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of El Nino and the Asian financial
crisis working its way through the economy. Political instability
resulting from the presidential election and FUJIMORI's subsequent
departure from office limited growth in 2000. The downturn in the global
economy further depressed growth in 2001. President TOLEDO, who assumed
the presidency in July 2001, is working to reinvigorate the economy and
reduce unemployment. Economic growth in 2002 is projected to be 3 to 3.5%.

Background:  This archipelago is surrounded by productive fishing grounds
and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed
the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance
was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel
Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison
occupying the western islands. The islands are claimed by Vietnam
and Taiwan.

Spratly Islands

Introduction

Spratly Islands

Background:  This archipelago - surrounded by rich fishing grounds and
potentially by gas and oil deposits - is claimed in its entirety by
China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and
the Philippines. All five parties occupy certain islands or reefs.

Geography Spratly Islands

Location:  Southeastern Asia, group of reefs and islands in the South
China Sea, about two-thirds of the way from southern Vietnam to the
southern Philippines

Geographic coordinates:  8 38 N, 111 55 E

Map references:  Southeast Asia

Area:  total: less than 5 sq km note: includes 100 or so islets, coral
reefs, and sea mounts scattered over an area of nearly 410,000 sq km of
the central South China Sea water: 0 sq km land: less than 5 sq km

Economy Spratly Islands

Economy - overview:  Economic activity is limited to commercial
fishing. The proximity to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary
basins suggests the potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region
is largely unexplored, and there are no reliable estimates of potential
reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.

Transportation Spratly Islands

Waterways:  none

Ports and harbors:  none; offshore anchorage only

Military Spratly Islands

Military - note:  Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands
or reefs, of which about 45 are claimed and occupied by China, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam

Transnational Issues Spratly Islands

Disputes - international:  all of the Spratly Islands are claimed by
China, Taiwan, and Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Malaysia and
the Philippines; in 1984, Brunei established an exclusive fishing zone
that encompasses Louisa Reef in the southern Spratly Islands, but has
not publicly claimed the island; in 2000, China joined ASEAN discussions
towards creating a South China Sea "code of conduct" - a non-legally
binding confidence building measure

Economy Pakistan

Economy - overview:  Pakistan, an impoverished and underdeveloped country,
suffers from internal political disputes, lack of foreign investment,
and a costly confrontation with neighboring India. Pakistan's economic
prospects, marred by poor human development indicators, low levels
of foreign investment, and reliance on international creditors for
hard currency inflows, were nonetheless on an upswing through most of
2001. The MUSHARRAF government made significant inroads in macroeconomic
reform - it completed an IMF short-term loan program for the first time
and improved its standing with international creditors by increasing
revenue collection and restraining the fiscal deficit in the 2001/02
budget. While Pakistan has capitalized on its international standing after
the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US by garnering substantial
assistance from abroad - including $1.3 billion in IMF Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility aid and $12.5 billion in Paris Club debt rescheduling
- long-term prospects remain uncertain. GDP growth will continue to
hinge on crop performance; dependence on foreign oil leaves the import
bill vulnerable to fluctuating oil prices; and foreign and domestic
investors remain wary of committing to projects in Pakistan. Pakistani
trade levels - already in decline due to the global economic downturn -
worsened in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.

Poland

Background:  Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived around
the middle of the 10th century.  It's golden age occurred in the 16th
century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry
and internal disorders weakened the nation, until an agreement in 1772
between Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland. Poland regained
its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet
Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite country following
the war, but one that was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor
turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union
"Solidarity" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had
swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A "shock therapy"
program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its
economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, boosting hopes
for acceptance to the EU.  Poland joined the NATO alliance in 1999.

the resulting acid rain has caused forest damage; water pollution from
industrial and municipal sources is also a problem, as is disposal of
hazardous wastes

Economy Poland

Economy - overview:  Poland has steadfastly pursued a policy of
liberalizing the economy and today stands out as one of the most
successful and open transition economies. GDP growth had been strong
and steady in 1993-2000 but fell back in 2001 with slowdowns in domestic
investment and consumption and the weakening in the global economy. The
privatization of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal
law on establishing new firms have allowed for the rapid development of a
vibrant private sector. In contrast, Poland's large agricultural sector
remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor, inefficient
small farms, and lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization
of "sensitive sectors" (e.g., coal, steel, railroads, and energy)
has begun. Structural reforms in health care, education, the pension
system, and state administration have resulted in larger than expected
fiscal pressures. Further progress in public finance depends mainly
on privatization of Poland's remaining state sector. The government's
determination to enter the EU as soon as possible affects most aspects
of its economic policies. Improving Poland's outsized current account
deficit and reining in inflation are priorities.  Warsaw leads the region
in foreign investment and needs a continued large inflow.

Introduction

Panama

Background:  With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and
promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of
a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the
structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US
Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. On 7 September 1977, an
agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to
Panama by the end of 1999. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing
responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the intervening
years. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The
entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US
military bases were turned over to Panama by or on 31 December 1999.

Economy Panama

Economy - overview:  Panama's economy is based primarily on a
well-developed services sector that accounts for three-fourths of
GDP. Services include the Panama Canal, banking, the Colon Free Zone,
insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. A slump
in Colon Free Zone and agricultural exports, the global slowdown,
and the withdrawal of US military forces held back economic growth in
2000-01. The government plans public works programs, tax reforms, and
new regional trade agreements in order to stimulate growth.

Introduction

Portugal

Background:  Following its heyday as a world power during the 15th
and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with
the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the
Napoleonic Wars, and the independence in 1822 of Brazil as a colony. A
1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades
repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military
coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year Portugal
granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal entered
the EC (now the EU)in 1985.

Economy Portugal

Economy - overview:  Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly
service-based economy since joining the European Community in
1986. Over the past decade, successive governments have privatized many
state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including
the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country qualified for
the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began circulating its new
currency, the euro, on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU member
economies. Economic growth has been above the EU average for much of
the past decade, but GDP per capita stands at just 75% of that of the
leading EU economies. The government has failed to reign in a widening
deficit and to advance structural reforms needed to boost Portugal's
economic competitiveness. A poor educational system, in particular, has
been an obstacle to greater productivity and growth. Portugal has been
increasingly overshadowed by lower-cost producers in Central Europe and
Asia as a target for foreign direct investment.

Introduction Papua New Guinea

Background:  The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second
largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK
(south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902,
which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to
administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A nine-year
secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997, after
claiming some 20,000 lives.

Economy Papua New Guinea

Economy - overview:  Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and the
high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence
livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits, including oil,
copper, and gold, account for 72% of export earnings. The economy has
declined over the past two years and will probably continue to falter
in 2002. Prime Minister Mekere MORAUTA has tried to restore integrity
to state institutions, stabilize the kina, restore stability to the
national budget, privatize public enterprises where appropriate, and
ensure ongoing peace on Bougainville. The government has had considerable
success in attracting international support, specifically gaining the
support of the IMF and the World Bank in securing development assistance
loans. Significant challenges remain for MORAUTA, however, including
gaining further investor confidence, specifically for the proposed
Papua New Guinea-Australia oil pipeline, continuing efforts to privatize
government assets, and maintaining the support of members of Parliament.

Guinea-Bissau

Introduction

Guinea-Bissau

Background:  In 1994, 20 years after independence from Portugal,
the country's first multiparty legislative and presidential elections
were held. An army uprising that triggered a bloody civil war in 1998,
created hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. The president was
ousted by a military junta in May 1999. An interim government turned
over power in February 2000 when opposition leader Kumba YALA took
office following two rounds of transparent presidential elections.
Guinea-Bissau's transition back to democracy will be complicated by its
crippled economy devastated in the civil war.

Economy Guinea-Bissau

Economy - overview:  One of the 10 poorest countries in the world,
Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks sixth
in cashew production.  Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with
small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the major crop
and staple food. However, intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed
government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country's
infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998;
the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with partial recovery
in 1999-2001. Before the war, trade reform and price liberalization
were the most successful part of the country's structural adjustment
program under IMF sponsorship.  The tightening of monetary policy and
the development of the private sector had also begun to reinvigorate the
economy. Because of high costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate,
and other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect. However,
unexploited offshore oil reserves could provide much-needed revenue in
the long run. The inequality of income distribution is one of the most
extreme in the world. The government and international donors continue
to work out plans to forward economic development.

Introduction

Qatar

Background:  Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar
transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for
pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas
revenues.  During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy
was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by
the amir who had ruled the country since 1972. He was overthrown by his
son, the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, in a bloodless coup in
1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Oil and natural gas revenues enable Qatar to
have a per capita income not far below the leading industrial countries
of Western Europe.

Economy Qatar

Economy - overview:  Oil accounts for more than 30% of GDP, roughly 80%
of export earnings, and 58% of government revenues. Proved oil reserves
of 3.7 billion barrels should ensure continued output at current levels
for 23 years. Oil has given Qatar a per capita GDP comparable to that of
the leading West European industrial countries. Qatar's proved reserves
of natural gas exceed 7 trillion cubic meters, more than 5% of the world
total, third largest in the world. Production and export of natural
gas are becoming increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the
development of offshore natural gas reserves. In 2000, Qatar posted its
highest ever trade surplus of $7 billion, due mainly to high oil prices
and increased natural gas exports, and managed to maintain the surplus
in 2001.

Background:  The Portuguese discovered the uninhabited island in
1513. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French immigration supplemented
by influxes of Africans, Chinese, Malays, and Malabar Indians gave the
island its ethnic mix. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cost the
island its importance as a stopover on the East Indies trade route.

Economy Reunion

Economy - overview:  The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture. Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century,
and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has
been pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high
unemployment, which amounts to more than 40% of the labor force. The gap
in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts
for the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian communities
are substantially better off than other segments of the population,
often approaching European standards, whereas minority groups suffer the
poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African
continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates
the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of
Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France.

Economy Marshall Islands

Economy - overview:  US Government assistance is the mainstay of this tiny
island economy.  Agricultural production is primarily subsistence and
is concentrated on small farms; the most important commercial crops are
coconuts and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts,
tuna processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of
foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains
the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural
resources, and imports far exceed exports.  Under the terms of the
Compact of Free Association, the US provides roughly $39 million in annual
aid. Negotiations have continued for an extended agreement. Government
downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline in tourism and
foreign investment due to the Asian financial difficulties, and less
income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth
to an average of 1% over the past decade.

Introduction

Romania

Background:  Soviet occupation following World War II led to the
formation of a Communist "peoples republic" in 1947 and the abdication
of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU
and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and
draconian through the 1980s.  CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed
in late 1989. Former communists dominated the government until 1996
when they were swept from power by a fractious coalition of center-right
parties. Today the Communist Party, renamed the Party of Social Democracy,
rules in cooperation with the ethnic Hungarian minority rights party.
Much economic restructuring remains to be carried out before Romania
can achieve its hope of joining the EU.

Economy Romania

Economy - overview:  Romania, one of the poorest countries of Central
and Eastern Europe, began the transition from Communism in 1989 with a
largely obsolete industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the
country's needs. Over the past decade economic restructuring has lagged
behind most other countries in the region. Consequently, living standards
have continued to fall - real wages are down perhaps 40%.  The country
emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year recession thanks to strong
demand in EU export markets, and despite the global slowdown in 2001,
strong domestic activity in construction, agriculture, and consumption
led to 4.8% growth. A standby agreement with the IMF - covering the
period October 2001 to March 2003 - provides a key opportunity for
vigorous privatization, regulatory reform, deficit reduction, and the
curbing of inflation.  The government in the past has not been able to
fully implement IMF agreements; its degree of success in this case will
affect prospects for joining the EU.

Bulgarian-Romanian team will recommend sovereignty changes to several
islands and redefine the boundary

Philippines

Introduction

Philippines

Background:  The Philippines were ceded by Spain to the US in 1898
following the Spanish-American War. They attained their independence
in 1946 after Japanese occupation in World War II. The 21-year rule of
Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986 when a widespread popular rebellion forced
him into exile. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases on the
islands. The Philippines has had two electoral presidential transitions
since Marcos' removal by "people power." In January 2001, the Supreme
Court declared Joseph ESTRADA unable to rule in view of mass resignations
from his government and administered the oath of office to Vice President
Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO as his constitutional successor. The government
continues to struggle with ongoing Muslim insurgencies in the south.

Economy Philippines

Economy - overview:  In 1998 the Philippine economy - a mixture of
agriculture, light industry, and supporting services - deteriorated as
a result of spillover from the Asian financial crisis and poor weather
conditions. Growth fell to 0.6% in 1998 from 5% in 1997, but recovered
to about 3% in 1999 and 4% in 2000. The government has promised to
continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines match the pace
of development in the newly industrialized countries of East Asia. The
strategy includes improving infrastructure, overhauling the tax system to
bolster government revenues, furthering deregulation and privatization of
the economy, and increasing trade integration with the region. Prospects
for 2002 depend heavily on the economic performance of two major trading
partners, the US and Japan.

Puerto Rico

Introduction

Puerto Rico

Background:  Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island
was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following Columbus' second
voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that
saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave
labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the
Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in
1917 and popularly elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952,
a constitution was enacted providing for internal self-government. In
plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998 voters chose to retain
commonwealth status.

Economy Puerto Rico

Economy - overview:  Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic
economies in the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has
surpassed agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and
income. Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives,
US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum
wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the agricultural
sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income,
with estimated arrivals of nearly 5 million tourists in 1999. Growth
fell off in 2001, largely due to the slowdown in the US economy.

Introduction

Russia

Background:  The defeat of the Russian Empire in World War I led to the
seizure of power by the Communists and the formation of the USSR. The
brutal rule of Josef STALIN (1924-53) strengthened Russian dominance
of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet
economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General
Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness)
and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism,
but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991
splintered the USSR into 15 independent republics. Since then, Russia
has struggled in its efforts to build a democratic political system and
market economy to replace the strict social, political, and economic
controls of the Communist period. A determined guerrilla conflict still
plagues Russia in Chechnya.

Economy Russia

Economy - overview:  A decade after the implosion of the Soviet Union in
December 1991, Russia is still struggling to establish a modern market
economy and achieve strong economic growth. In contrast to its trading
partners in Central Europe - which were able to overcome the initial
production declines that accompanied the launch of market reforms within
three to five years - Russia saw its economy contract for five years, as
the executive and legislature dithered over the implementation of many
of the basic foundations of a market economy. Russia achieved a slight
recovery in 1997, but the government's stubborn budget deficits and
the country's poor business climate made it vulnerable when the global
financial crisis swept through in 1998. The crisis culminated in the
August depreciation of the ruble, a debt default by the government, and a
sharp deterioration in living standards for most of the population. The
economy subsequently has rebounded, growing by an average of more than
6% annually in 1999-2001 on the back of higher oil prices and a weak
ruble. This recovery, along with a renewed government effort in 2000
and 2001 to advance lagging structural reforms, have raised business
and investor confidence over Russia's prospects in its second decade
of transition. Yet serious problems persist. Russia remains heavily
dependent on exports of commodities, particularly oil, natural gas,
metals, and timber, which account for over 80% of exports, leaving the
country vulnerable to swings in world prices. Russia's industrial base
is increasingly dilapidated and must be replaced or modernized if the
country is to achieve sustainable economic growth. Other problems include
widespread corruption, lack of a strong legal system, capital flight,
and brain drain.

Rwanda

Introduction

Rwanda

Background:  In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the
majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over
the next several years thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000
driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles
later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and began a
civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic
upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions culminating in April 1994 in
the genocide of roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi
rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the killing in July 1994, but
approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution -
fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then
most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda.  Despite substantial
international assistance and political reforms - including Rwanda's first
local elections in March 1999 - the country continues to struggle to
boost investment and agricultural output and to foster reconciliation. A
series of massive population displacements, a nagging Hutu extremist
insurgency, and Rwandan involvement in two wars over the past four years
in the neighboring DROC continue to hinder Rwanda's efforts.

Economy Rwanda

Economy - overview:  Rwanda is a rural country with about 90% of
the population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture. It is
the most densely populated country in Africa; landlocked with few
natural resources and minimal industry. Primary exports are coffee
and tea. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base,
severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded the
country's ability to attract private and external investment. However,
Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating
its economy.  GDP has rebounded, and inflation has been curbed. Rwanda
received approval for debt relief from the IMF in late 2000 and continued
to make progress on inflation, privatization, and GDP growth in 2001.
However, export earnings were hindered by low global coffee prices,
depriving the country of much needed hard currency. President KAGAME
is encouraging investors to take advantage of export opportunities in
Rwanda based on its membership in the COMESA free trade area and its
access to the US and the EU markets through preferential trade agreements.

Saudi Arabia

Introduction Saudi Arabia

Background:  In 1902 Abd al-Aziz Ibn SAUD captured Riyadh and set out
on a 30-year campaign to unify the Arabian Peninsula. In the 1930s,
the discovery of oil transformed the country. Following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and
400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on
its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. A burgeoning
population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on
petroleum output and prices are all major governmental concerns.

Economy Saudi Arabia

Economy - overview:  This is an oil-based economy with strong government
controls over major economic activities. Saudi Arabia has the largest
reserves of petroleum in the world (26% of the proved reserves), ranks as
the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The
petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 45% of
GDP, and 90% of export earnings. About 25% of GDP comes from the private
sector. Roughly 4 million foreign workers play an important role in the
Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and service sectors. Riyadh expects
to have a budget deficit in 2002, in part because of increased spending
for education and other social programs. The government in 1999 announced
plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies, which follows the
ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. The government
is expected to continue calling for private sector growth to lessen the
kingdom's dependence on oil and increase employment opportunities for
the swelling Saudi population. Shortages of water and rapid population
growth will constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency
in agricultural products.

Economy Saint Pierre and Miquelon

Economy - overview:  The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the
coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because
of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the
number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration panel
awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle
a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents
only 25% of what France had sought. The islands are heavily subsidized
by France to the great betterment of living standards. The government
hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects. Recent test
drilling for oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector.

Geography - note:  with coastlines in the shape of a baseball bat and
ball, the two volcanic islands are separated by a three-km-wide channel
called The Narrows; on the southern tip of long, baseball bat-shaped
Saint Kitts lies the Great Salt Pond; Nevis Peak sits in the center of
its almost circular namesake island and its ball shape complements that
of its sister island

Economy Saint Kitts and Nevis

Economy - overview:  Sugar was the traditional mainstay of the
St. Kitts economy until the 1970s.  Although the crop still dominates
the agricultural sector, activities such as tourism, export-oriented
manufacturing, and offshore banking have assumed larger roles in the
economy. As tourism revenues are now the chief source of the islands'
foreign exchange, a decline in stopover tourist arrivals following
the September 11 terrorist attacks has eroded government finances. The
government revised estimates of 2001 growth down to 1% and faces dim
recovery prospects in 2002, given the depressed state of the tourism
industry, low sugar prices, and a growing budget deficit.

Economy Seychelles

Economy - overview:  Since independence in 1976, per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the old
near-subsistence level.  Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which
employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard
currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years the government
has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other
services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the
dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing,
and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector
was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf
war and once again following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on
the US. Other issues facing the government are the curbing of the budget
deficit, including the containment of social welfare costs, and further
privatization of public enterprises. Growth slowed in 1998-2001, due
to sluggish tourist and tuna sectors. Also, tight controls on exchange
rates and the scarcity of foreign exchange have impaired short-term
economic prospects. The black market value of the Seychelles rupee is
half the official exchange rate; without a devaluation of the currency
the tourist sector should remain sluggish as vacationers seek cheaper
destinations such as Comoros, Mauritius, and Madagascar.

South Africa

Introduction South Africa

Background:  After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in
1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found
their own republics.  The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886)
spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the
native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments, but were
defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902). The resulting Union of South Africa
operated under a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the
races. The 1990s brought an end to apartheid politically and ushered in
black majority rule.

Economy South Africa

Economy - overview:  South Africa is a middle-income, developing country
with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal,
communications, energy, and transport sectors, a stock exchange that
ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a modern infrastructure
supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers
throughout the region. However, growth has not been strong enough to cut
into high unemployment, and daunting economic problems remain from the
apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and lack of economic
empowerment among the disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime,
corruption, and HIV/AIDS. At the start of 2000, President MBEKI vowed to
promote economic growth and foreign investment, and to reduce poverty by
relaxing restrictive labor laws, stepping up the pace of privatization,
and cutting unneeded governmental spending. The economy slowed in 2001,
largely the result of the slowing of the international economy.

Economy Senegal

Economy - overview:  In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and
ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international
donor community. This reform began with a 50% devaluation of Senegal's
currency, the CFA franc, which is linked at a fixed rate to the French
franc. Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily
dismantled. After seeing its economy contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal
made an important turnaround, thanks to the reform program, with real
growth in GDP averaging 5% annually during 1995-2001. Annual inflation had
been pushed down to less than 1%, but rose to an estimated 3.3% in 2001.
Investment rose steadily from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in 1997. As a
member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal
is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external
tariff. Senegal also realized full Internet connectivity in 1996, creating
a miniboom in information technology-based services. Private activity now
accounts for 82% of GDP. On the negative side, Senegal faces deep-seated
urban problems of chronic unemployment, trade union militancy, juvenile
delinquency, and drug addiction.

Slovenia

Introduction

Slovenia

Background:  The Slovene lands were part of the Holy Roman Empire and
Austria until 1918 when the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in
forming a new nation, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II,
Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though
Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with
the exercise of power of the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded
in establishing their independence in 1991. Historical ties to Western
Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy make Slovenia a leading
candidate for future membership in the EU and NATO.

Economy Slovenia

Economy - overview:  Although Slovenia enjoys a GDP per capita
substantially higher than that of the other transitioning economies
of Central Europe, it needs to speed up the privatization process and
the dismantling of restrictions on foreign investment. About 45% of the
economy remains in state hands, and the level of foreign direct investment
inflows as a percent of GDP is the lowest in the region. Despite the
global slowdown in 2001, the economy turned in an excellent record on
exports, which grew 5%. Inflation dropped slightly but at 8.4% remains
a matter of concern.

Sierra Leone

Introduction

Sierra Leone

Background:  Since 1991, civil war between the government and the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has resulted in tens of thousands of
deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (well over
one-third of the population) many of whom are now refugees in neighboring
countries. After several setbacks, the end to the eleven-year conflict
in Sierra Leone may finally be near at hand. With the support of the UN
peacekeeping force and contributions from the World Bank and international
community, demobilization and disarmament of the RUF and Civil Defense
Forces (CDF) combatants has been completed.  Reestablishment of government
authority throughout the country is slowly proceeding and national
elections took place in May 2002.

Economy Sierra Leone

Economy - overview:  Sierra Leone is an extremely poor African nation with
tremendous inequality in income distribution. It does have substantial
mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources. However, the economic
and social infrastructure is not well developed, and serious social
disorders continue to hamper economic development, following a 10-year
civil war. About two-thirds of the working-age population engages in
subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing
of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. There
are plans to reopen bauxite and rutile mines shut down during the
conflict. The major source of hard currency consists of the mining
of diamonds. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of
domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad.

Economy Singapore

Economy - overview:  Singapore, a highly developed and successful
free-market economy, enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free
environment, stable prices, and one of the highest per capita GDPs in the
world. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in electronics
and manufacturing, and was hard hit in 2001 by the global recession and
the slump in the technology sector. In 2001, GDP contracted by 2.2%. The
economy is expected to recover in 2002 in response to improvements
in the US economy, and GDP growth for 2002 is projected to be 3% to
4%. In the longer term the government hopes to establish a new growth
path that will be less vulnerable to the external business cycle than
the current export-led model, but is unlikely to abandon efforts to
establish Singapore as Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.

Somalia

Introduction

Somalia

Background:  The SIAD BARRE regime was ousted in January 1991; turmoil,
factional fighting, and anarchy have followed for eleven years. In May
of 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland
that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed,
Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government,
this entity has maintained a stable existence, aided by the overwhelming
dominance of a ruling clan and economic infrastructure left behind by
British, Russian, and American military assistance programs. The regions
of Bari and Nugaal comprise a neighboring self-declared autonomous state
of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998, but does not
aim at independence; it has also made strides towards reconstructing
legitimate, representative government. Puntland also claims Sool and
eastern Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort
(primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but
when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties,
order still had not been restored. A Transitional National Government
(TNG) was created in August 2000 in Arta, Djibouti which was attended
by a broad representation of Somali clans. The TNG has a three-year
mandate to create a permanent national Somali government. The TNG does
not recognize Somaliland as an independent republic but so far has
been unable to reunite either Somaliland or Puntland with the unstable
regions in the south. Numerous warlords and factions are still fighting
for control of Mogadishu and the other southern regions. Suspicion of
Somali links with global terrorism complicate the picture.

Economy Somalia

Economy - overview:  One of the world's poorest and least
developed countries, Somalia has few resources and is prone to
drought. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by civil war
since 1991. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock
accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads
and semi-nomads, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood,
make up a large portion of the population. Livestock, hides, charcoal,
and bananas are Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn,
fish, qat, and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's
small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural
products, has largely been looted and sold as scrap metal. Despite the
seeming anarchy, Somalia's service sector has managed to survive and
grow. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major
cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. In
the absence of a formal banking sector, money exchange services have
sprouted throughout the country, handling between $200 million and
$500 million in remittances annually.  Mogadishu's main market offers
a variety of goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels
continue to operate, and security is provided by militias. Ongoing
civil disturbances and clan rivalries, however, have interfered with any
broad-based economic development and international aid arrangements. The
failure of spring rains caused major food shortages in the south in 2001.
Economic data is scare and prone to a wide margin of error.

Spain

Introduction

Spain

Background:  Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries
ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure
to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country
to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political
power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II, but suffered
through a devastating civil war (1936-39). In the second half of the 20th
century, Spain has played a catch-up role in the western international
community. Continuing concerns are Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA)
terrorism and further reductions in unemployment.

Economy Spain

Economy - overview:  Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP
that on a per capita basis is 80% that of the four leading West European
economies. Its center-right government successfully worked to gain
admission to the first group of countries launching the European single
currency on 1 January 1999. The AZNAR administration has continued to
advocate liberalization, privatization, and deregulation of the economy
and has introduced some tax reforms to that end. Unemployment has been
steadily falling under the AZNAR administration but remains the highest
in the EU at 13%. The government intends to make further progress in
changing labor laws and reforming pension schemes, which are key to
the sustainability of both Spain's internal economic advances and its
competitiveness in a single currency area. Adjusting to the monetary and
other economic policies of an integrated Europe - and further reducing
unemployment - will pose challenges to Spain over the next few years.

Alhucemas, Penon de Velez de la Gomera, and Islas Chafarinas; Morocco
rejected Spain's unilateral designation of a median line from the Canary
Islands in 2002 to explore undersea resources and to interdict illegal
refugees from Africa

Sudan

Introduction

Sudan

Background:  Military dictatorships favoring an Islamic-oriented
government have dominated national politics since independence from the
UK in 1956.  Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for all but 10 years
of this period (1972-82). Since 1983, the war and war- and famine-related
effects have led to more than 2 million deaths and over 4 million people
displaced. The war pits the Arab/Muslim majority in Khartoum against
the non-Muslim African rebels in the south. Since 1989, traditional
northern Muslim parties have made common cause with the southern rebels
and entered the war as a part of an anti-government alliance.

Economy Sudan

Economy - overview:  Sudan has turned around a struggling economy with
sound economic policies and infrastructure investments, but it still faces
formidable economic problems. Starting in 1997 Sudan began implementing
IMF macroeconomic reforms that have successfully stabilized inflation.
In 1999 Sudan began exporting crude oil and in the last quarter of
1999 recorded its first trade surplus, along with monetary policy, has
stabilized the exchange rate. Current oil production stands at 220,000
barrels per day, of which some 70% is exported and the rest refined
mostly for domestic consumption. Increased oil production, revived light
industry, and expanded export processing zones should maintain GDP growth
at 5% in 2002. Agriculture production remains Sudan's most important
sector, employing 80% of the work force and contributing 43% of GDP,
but most farms remain rain-fed and susceptible to drought. Sudan is also
constrained by its limited access to international credit; most of Sudan's
$24.9 billion debt remains in arrears. The civil war, chronic instability,
adverse weather, and weak world agricultural prices ensure that much of
the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years.

Economy Svalbard

Economy - overview:  Coal mining is the major economic activity on
Svalbard. The treaty of 9 February 1920 gives the 41 signatories
equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian
regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have
mined in the past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and
Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The
Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian
population on the island, runs many of the local services, and provides
most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal,
polar bear, fox, and walrus.

Sweden

Introduction

Sweden

Background:  A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not
participated in any war in almost two centuries. An armed neutrality was
preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's long-successful economic formula
of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was
challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment, rising maintenance costs,
and a declining position in world markets. Indecision over the country's
role in the political and economic integration of Europe delayed Sweden's
entry into the EU until 1995, and waived the introduction of the euro
in 1999.

Economy Sweden

Economy - overview:  Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole 20th
century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It
has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and
iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented
toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of
industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50%
of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only 2% of GDP and 2%
of the jobs. The government's commitment to fiscal discipline resulted
in a substantive budgetary surplus in 2001, but is expected to shrink
somewhat in 2002, due to the global economic slowdown, tax cuts, and
spending increases. The Swedish central bank (the Riksbank) is focusing
on price stability with an inflation target of 2% for 2002.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands

Introduction South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands

Background:  The islands lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland
Islands and have been under British administration since 1908 except for
a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them. Grytviken, on South
Georgia, was a 19th and early 20th century whaling station. The famed
explorer Ernest SHACKLETON stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated
attempt to cross Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later
with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue
for the rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died
in 1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today, the
station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. The islands
have large bird and seal populations and, recognizing the importance of
preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended
the exclusive fishing zone from 12 NM to 200 NM around each island.

Economy Syria

Economy - overview:  Syria's predominantly statist economy has been
growing slower than its 2.5% annual population growth rate, causing a
persistent decline in per capita GDP. President Bashar AL-ASAD has made
little progress on the economic front after one year in office, but does
appear willing to permit a gradual strengthening of the private sector.
His most obvious accomplishment to this end was the recent passage
of legislation allowing private banks to operate in Syria, although a
private banking sector will take years and further government cooperation
to develop. ASAD's recent cabinet reshuffle may improve his chances of
implementing further growth-oriented policies, although external factors
such as the international war on terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, and downturn in oil prices could weaken the foreign investment
and government revenues Syria needs to flourish. A long-run economic
constraint is the pressure on water supplies caused by rapid population
growth, industrial expansion, and increased water pollution.

UN and international organizations has strengthened Switzerland's ties
with its neighbors. Switzerland is active in many UN and international
organizations, but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.

Economy Switzerland

Economy - overview:  Switzerland is a prosperous and stable modern
market economy with a per capita GDP higher than that of the big
western European economies. The Swiss in recent years have brought their
economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their
international competitiveness. Although the Swiss are not pursuing full EU
membership in the near term, in 1999 Bern and Brussels signed agreements
to further liberalize trade ties. They continue to discuss further areas
for cooperation. Switzerland remains a safe haven for investors, because
it has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's
long-term external value. The GDP growth rate dipped to 1.6% in 2001,
and the government projects that it will slow further to 1.3% in 2002.

United Arab Emirates

Introduction

United Arab Emirates

Background:  The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK
control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In
1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah,
Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).  They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per
capita GDP is not far below those of leading West European nations. Its
generosity with oil revenues and its moderate foreign policy stance have
allowed the UAE to play a vital role in the affairs of the region.

Economy United Arab Emirates

Economy - overview:  The UAE has an open economy with a high per capita
income and a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is based on oil and
gas output (about 33% of GDP), and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate
with the prices of those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone
a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert
principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At
present levels of production, oil and gas reserves should last for more
than 100 years. The government has increased spending on job creation
and infrastructure expansion and is opening up its utilities to greater
private sector involvement.

Shariqah (Sharjah) emirates, including the Musandam Peninsula, where
an administrative boundary substitutes for an international boundary;
because details of 1974 and 1977 treaties have not been made public, the
exact location of the Saudi Arabia-UAE boundary is unknown and status is
considered de facto; UAE seeks United Arab League and other international
support against Iran's occupation of Greater Tunb Island (called Tunb
al Kubra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by
Iran) and Lesser Tunb Island (called Tunb as Sughra in Arabic by UAE
and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and attempts to occupy
completely a jointly administered island in the Persian Gulf (called
Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)

Illicit drugs:  The UAE is a drug transshipment point for traffickers
given its proximity to southwest Asian drug producing countries; the
UAE's position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable to money
laundering; anti-money-laundering legislation was signed into law by
the president on 25 January 2002

Economy Trinidad and Tobago

Economy - overview:  Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation
as an excellent investment site for international businesses. A
leading performer in the past 4 years has been the booming natural gas
sector. Tourism is a growing sector, although not proportionately as
important as in many other Caribbean islands. The expected recovery of
the global economy, along with anticipated higher oil prices, are plus
factors for 2002. Negative factors are persistent high unemployment and
the political uncertainties following the contentious selection of a
new government in December 2001.

Economy Thailand

Economy - overview:  After enjoying the world's highest growth rate
from 1985 to 1995 - averaging almost 9% annually - increased speculative
pressure on Thailand's currency in 1997 led to a crisis that uncovered
financial sector weaknesses and forced the government to float the
baht. Long pegged at 25 to the dollar, the baht reached its lowest
point of 56 to the dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted
by 10.2% that same year.  Thailand entered a recovery stage in 1999,
expanding 4.2% and grew 4.4% in 2000, largely due to strong exports -
which increased about 20% in 2000. An ailing financial sector and the
slow pace of corporate debt restructuring, combined with a softening of
global demand, however, slowed growth in 2001 to 1.4%.

Tajikistan

Introduction

Tajikistan

Background:  Tajikistan has experienced three changes in government and
a five-year civil war since it gained independence in 1991 from the
USSR. A peace agreement among rival factions was signed in 1997, and
implemented in 2000. The central government's less than total control
over some areas of the country has forced it to compromise and forge
alliances among factions. Open skirmishes in the streets are less of a
problem than they were during the war five years ago.  Attention by the
international community in the wake of the war in Afghanistan may bring
increased economic development assistance, which would create jobs and
increase stability in the long term.  Tajikistan is in the beginning
stages of seeking World Trade Organization membership and has been
approved to join NATO's Partnership for Peace.

Economy Tajikistan

Economy - overview:  Tajikistan has the lowest per capita GDP among the
15 former Soviet republics. Cotton is the most important crop. Mineral
resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold, uranium,
and tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant, hydropower
facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry and
food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely damaged the already
weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and
agricultural production. Even though 80% of its people continue to live
in abject poverty, Tajikistan has experienced strong economic growth since
1997. Continued privatization of medium and large state-owned enterprises
will further increase productivity. Tajikistan's economic situation,
however, remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural
reforms, weak governance, and the external debt burden. Servicing of
the debt, owed principally to Russia and Uzbekistan, could require as
much as 50% of government revenues in 2002, thus limiting the nation's
ability to meet pressing development needs.

Turks and Caicos Islands

Introduction Turks and Caicos Islands

Background:  The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962,

of revenue come from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins,
and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to families from relatives in

Economy Tonga

Economy - overview:  Tonga has a small, open economy with a narrow export
base in agricultural goods.  Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans
are the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of total
exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly
from New Zealand. Tourism is the second largest source of hard currency
earnings following remittances. The country remains dependent on external
aid and remittances from Tongan communities overseas to offset its trade
deficit. The government is emphasizing the development of the private
sector, especially the encouragement of investment, and is committing
increased funds for health and education. Tonga has a reasonable basic
infrastructure and well-developed social services.

Introduction

Togo

Background:  French Togoland became Togo in 1960. General Gnassingbe
EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, is Africa's longest-serving
head of state.  Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in
the early 1990s, the government continues to be dominated by President
EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained
power almost continually since 1967. In addition, Togo has come under
fire from international organizations for human rights abuses and is
plagued by political unrest. Most bilateral and multilateral aid to Togo
remains frozen.

provides employment for 65% of the labor force. Some basic foodstuffs
must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton generate about
40% of export earnings, with cotton being the most significant cash
crop despite falling prices on the world market. Political unrest,
including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993,
jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted vital
economic activity. The 12 January 1994 devaluation of the XOF currency
by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment.
In the industrial sector, phosphate mining is by far the most important
activity. Togo is the world's fourth largest producer, and geological
advantages keep production costs low. The recently privatized mining
operation, Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP), is slowly recovering
from a steep fall in prices in the early 1990's, but continues to face
the challenge of tough foreign competition, exacerbated by weakening
demand. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. It
continues to expand its duty-free export-processing zone (EPZ), launched
in 1989, which has attracted enterprises from France, Italy, Scandinavia,
the US, India, and China and created jobs for Togolese nationals. The
government's decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF,
to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and
bring revenues in line with expenditures has stalled. Progress depends
on following through on privatization, increased openness in government
financial operations, progress towards legislative elections, and possible
downsizing of the military, on which the regime has depended to stay in
place. Lack of large-scale foreign aid, deterioration of the financial
sector, energy shortages, and depressed commodity prices continue to
constrain economic growth. The takeover of the national power company
by a Franco-Canadian consortium in 2000 should ease the energy crisis.

Economy Sao Tome and Principe

Economy - overview:  This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence 26 years ago. However,
cocoa production has substantially declined because of drought and
mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export has created a
persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao Tome has to import all fuels,
most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of
food. Over the years, it has been unable to service its external debt
and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao
Tome benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. Sao Tome's success in
implementing structural reforms has been rewarded by international donors,
who have pledged increased assistance in 2001. Considerable potential
exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has
taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also
has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. Sao Tome is also
optimistic that substantial petroleum discoveries are forthcoming in
its territorial waters in the oil-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea.
Corruption scandals continue to weaken the economy.

Introduction

Tunisia

Background:  Following independence from France in 1956, President
Habib BOURGUIBA established a strict one-party state. He dominated the
country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing

Tunisia has taken a moderate, non-aligned stance in its foreign
relations. Domestically, it has sought to diffuse rising pressure for
a more open political society.

Economy Tunisia

Economy - overview:  Tunisia has a diverse economy, with
important agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing
sectors. Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has
gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization,
simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to
debt. Real growth averaged 5.4% in the past five years, and inflation is
slowing. Growth in tourism and increased trade have been key elements
in this steady growth, although tourism revenues have slowed since 11
September 2001 and may take a year or more to fully recover. Tunisia's
association agreement with the European Union entered into force on 1
March 1998, the first such accord between the EU and a Mediterranean
country. Under the agreement Tunisia will gradually remove barriers to
trade with the EU over the next decade. Broader privatization, further
liberalization of the investment code to increase foreign investment,
and improvements in government efficiency are among the challenges for
the future.

East Timor

Introduction East Timor

Background:  The Portuguese colony of Timor declared itself independent
from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by
Indonesian forces nine days later. It was subsequently incorporated
into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur. A so-called
campaign of pacification followed, during which time an estimated
100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999,
in a UN-supervised popular referendum, the people of Timor Timur
voted for independence from Indonesia. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was
internationally recognized as an independent state and the world's

Economy East Timor

Economy - overview:  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic
infrastructure of East Timor was laid waste by Indonesian troops and
anti-independence militias, and 260,000 people fled westward. Over the
next three years, however, a massive international program, manned by
5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to
substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By mid-2002,
all but about 50,000 of the refugees had returned. The country faces
great challenges in continuing the rebuilding of infrastructure and the
strengthening of the infant civil administration. One promising long-term
project would be development of oil resources in nearby waters.

Turkey

Introduction

Turkey

Background:  Turkey was created in 1923 from the Turkish remnants of
the Ottoman Empire. Soon thereafter the country instituted secular laws
to replace traditional religious fiats. In 1945 Turkey joined the UN
and in 1952 it became a member of NATO. Turkey occupied the northern
portion of Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island;
relations between the two countries remain strained but have begun to
improve over the past three years. In 1984, the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK), a Marxist-Leninist, separatist group, initiated an insurgency in
Southeast Turkey, often using terrorist tactics to try to attain its goal
of an independent Kurdistan. The group - whose leader, Abdullah OCALAN,
was captured in Kenya in February 1999 and sentenced to death by a Turkish
court - has observed a unilateral cease-fire since September 1999,
although there have been occasional clashes between Turkish military
units and some of the 4,000-5,000 armed PKK militants, most of whom
currently are encamped in northern Iraq. The PKK changed its name to
the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress (KADEK) in April 2002.

Economy Turkey

Economy - overview:  Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern
industry and commerce along with a traditional agriculture sector
that in 2001 still accounted for 40% of employment. It has a strong
and rapidly growing private sector, yet the state still plays a major
role in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication. The
most important industry - and largest exporter - is textiles and
clothing, which is almost entirely in private hands. In recent years
the economic situation has been marked by erratic economic growth and
serious imbalances.  Real GNP growth has exceeded 6% in most years,
but this strong expansion was interrupted by sharp declines in output
in 1994, 1999, and 2001. Meanwhile the public sector fiscal deficit has
regularly exceeded 10% of GDP - due in large part to the huge burden
of interest payments, which in 2001 accounted for more than 50% of
central government spending - while inflation has remained in the high
double digit range. Perhaps because of these problems, foreign direct
investment in Turkey remains low - less than $1 billion annually. In
late 2000 and early 2001 a growing trade deficit and serious weaknesses
in the banking sector plunged the economy into crisis - forcing Ankara
to float the lira and pushing the country into recession. Prospects for
2002 are much better, because of strong financial support from the IMF,
tighter fiscal policy, a major bank restructuring program, and the
enactment of numerous other economic reforms.

Tuvalu

Introduction

Tuvalu

Background:  In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of
the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice
Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert
Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate
British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000,
Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv"
for $50 million in royalties over the next dozen years.

Geography Tuvalu

Location:  Oceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the
South Pacific Ocean, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia

Geographic coordinates:  8 00 S, 178 00 E

Map references:  Oceania

Area:  total: 26 sq km water: 0 sq km land: 26 sq km

Area - comparative:  0.1 times the size of Washington, DC

Land boundaries:  0 km

Coastline:  24 km

Maritime claims:   12 NM exclusive economic zone: Climate:  tropical;
moderated by easterly trade winds (March to November); westerly gales
and heavy rain (November to March)

Terrain:  very low-lying and narrow coral atolls

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point:
unnamed location 5 m

Natural resources:  fish

Land use:  arable land: 0% permanent crops: 0% other: 100% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  NA sq km

Natural hazards:  severe tropical storms are usually rare, but, in 1997,
there were three cyclones; low level of islands make them very sensitive
to changes in sea level

Environment - current issues:  since there are no streams or rivers and
groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment
systems with storage facilities (the Japanese Government has built one
desalination plant and plans to build one other); beachhead erosion
because of the use of sand for building materials; excessive clearance
of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the
spread of the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is very concerned about
global increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising
sea levels, which threaten the country's underground water table; in
2000, the government appealed to Australia and New Zealand to take in
Tuvaluans if rising sea levels should make evacuation necessary

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Climate Change,
Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Ozone Layer Protection,
Ship Pollution signed, but not ratified: Geography - note:  one of the
smallest and most remote countries on Earth; six of the coral atolls
- Nanumea, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, and Nukulaelae - have
lagoons open to the ocean; Nanumaya and Niutao have landlocked lagoons;
Niulakita does not have a lagoon

Economy Tuvalu

Economy - overview:  Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered
group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known
mineral resources and few exports.  Subsistence farming and fishing are
the primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average,
visit Tuvalu annually. Government revenues largely come from the sale
of stamps and coins and worker remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work
in Nauru in the phosphate mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating
Tuvaluans, however, as phosphate resources decline.  Substantial income
is received annually from an international trust fund established
in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and
South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals,
this Fund has grown from an initial $17 million to over $35 million
in 1999. The US government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu,
with 1999 payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries at about $9 million,
a total which is expected to rise annually. In an effort to reduce its
dependence on foreign aid, the government is pursuing public sector
reforms, including privatization of some government functions and
personnel cuts of up to 7%. In 1998, Tuvalu began deriving revenue from
use of its area code for "900" lines and in 2000, from the lease of its
".tv" Internet domain name. Royalties from these new technology sources
could raise GDP substantially over the next decade. With merchandise
exports only a fraction of merchandise imports, continued reliance must
be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees, remittances
from overseas workers, official transfers, and investment income from
overseas assets.

Taiwan

Introduction

Taiwan

Background:  In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan
to Japan, however it reverted to Chinese control after World War
II. Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million
Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947
constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades,
the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the
native population within its governing structure. This culminated in
2000, when Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from
the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this
period, the island has prospered to become one of East Asia's economic
"Tigers." The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship
between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of eventual
unification - as well as domestic political and economic reform.

Economy Taiwan

Economy - overview:  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy
with gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign
trade by government authorities. In keeping with this trend,
some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being
privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the
past three decades. Exports have provided the primary impetus for
industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
reserves are the world's third largest. Agriculture contributes 2%
to GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries
are steadily being moved offshore and replaced with more capital- and
technology-intensive industries.  Taiwan has become a major investor in
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam; 50,000
Taiwanese businesses are established in China. Because of its conservative
financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered
little compared with many of its neighbors from the Asian financial
crisis in 1998-99. The global economic downturn, however, combined
with poor policy coordination by the new administration and increasing
bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001,
the first whole year of negative growth since 1947.  Unemployment also
reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis.

Turkmenistan

Introduction

Turkmenistan

Background:  Annexed by Russia between 1865 and 1885, Turkmenistan
became a Soviet republic in 1925. It achieved its independence upon the
dissolution of the USSR in 1991. President NIYAZOV retains absolute
control over the country and opposition is not tolerated. Extensive
hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this underdeveloped
country if extraction and delivery projects can be worked out.

Irrigated land:  18,000 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  NA

Environment - current issues:  contamination of soil and groundwater
with agricultural chemicals, pesticides; salination, water-logging of
soil due to poor irrigation methods; Caspian Sea pollution; diversion of
a large share of the flow of the Amu Darya into irrigation contributes
to that river's inability to replenish the Aral Sea; desertification

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Biodiversity, Climate
Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes,
Ozone Layer Protection signed, but not ratified: none of the selected

Economy Turkmenistan

Economy - overview:  Turkmenistan is largely desert country with intensive
agriculture in irrigated oases and huge gas (fifth largest reserves in
the world) and oil resources. One-half of its irrigated land is planted
in cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. Until the end of
1993, Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption than other
former Soviet states because its economy received a boost from higher
prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In
1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets
and mounting debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas
deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and
caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. With an
authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social
structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic
reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient
economy. Privatization goals remain limited. In 1998-2001, Turkmenistan
has suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for
natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external
debt. At the same time, however, total exports have risen sharply
because of higher international oil and gas prices. Prospects in the
near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty, the
burden of foreign debt, and the unwillingness of the government to adopt
market-oriented reforms. However, Turkmenistan's cooperation with the
international community in transporting humanitarian aid to Afghanistan
may foreshadow a change in the atmosphere for foreign investment, aid,
and technological support. Turkmenistan's economic statistics are state
secrets, and GDP and other figures are subject to wide margins of error.

led to two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won
despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.

Economy Tanzania

Economy - overview:  Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the
world. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts
for half of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 80% of the work
force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated crops
to only 4% of the land area. Industry is mainly limited to processing
agricultural products and light consumer goods. The World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in
1991-2001 featured a pickup in industrial production and a substantial
increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Natural gas exploration
in the Rufiji Delta looks promising and production could start by
2002. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth
and investment. Continued donor support and solid macroeconomic policies
should support steady real GDP growth of 5% in 2002 and 2003.

Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed another 100,000 lives. During the 1990s the
government promulgated non-party presidential and legislative elections.

Economy Uganda

Economy - overview:  Uganda has substantial natural resources, including
fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper
and cobalt.  Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy,
employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and
accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government -
with the support of foreign countries and international agencies -
has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The
policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting
production and export earnings. During 1990-2001, the economy turned in
a solid performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation
of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports,
reduced inflation, gradually improved domestic security, and the return
of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Ongoing Ugandan involvement
in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, corruption within
the government, and slippage in the government's determination to press
reforms raise doubts about the continuation of strong growth. In 2000,
Uganda qualified for enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
debt relief worth $1.3 billion and Paris Club debt relief worth $145
million. These amounts combined with the original HIPC debt relief added
up to about $2 billion.  Growth for 2001 was held back because of a
continued decline in the price of coffee, Uganda's principal export.

Introduction

United Kingdom

Background:  Great Britain, the dominant industrial and maritime power
of the 19th century, played a leading role in developing parliamentary
democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the
British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The
first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted
in two World Wars. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the
Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous
European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security
Council, a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK
pursues a global approach to foreign policy; it currently is weighing
the degree of its integration with continental Europe. A member of the
EU, it chose to remain outside the European Monetary Union for the time
being. Constitutional reform is also a significant issue in the UK. The
Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern
Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.

aims to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste disposed
of in landfill sites to 85% of 1998 levels and to recycle or compost at
least 25% of household waste, increasing to 33% by 2015; between 1998-99

Economy United Kingdom

Economy - overview:  The UK, a leading trading power and financial center,
is one of the quartet of trillion dollar economies of Western Europe. Over
the past two decades the government has greatly reduced public ownership
and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force.
The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy
production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of
any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
industry continues to decline in importance. GDP growth slipped in 2001
as the global downturn, the high value of the pound, and the bursting
of the "new economy" bubble hurt manufacturing and exports. Still, the
economy is one of the strongest in Europe; inflation, interest rates,
and unemployment remain low, and the government expects growth of 2% to
2.5% in 2002. The relatively good economic performance has complicated
the BLAIR government's efforts to make a case for Britain to join the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Prime Minister has
pledged to hold a public referendum if membership meets Chancellor of
the Exchequer BROWN's five economic "tests." Scheduled for assessment
by mid-2003, the tests will determine whether joining EMU would have a
positive effect on British investment, employment, and growth. Critics
point out, however, that the economy is thriving outside of EMU, and
they point to public opinion polls that continue to show a majority of
Britons opposed to the single currency.

Ukraine

Introduction

Ukraine

Background:  Richly endowed in natural resources, Ukraine has been fought
over and subjugated for centuries; its 20th-century struggle for liberty
is not yet complete. A short-lived independence from Russia (1917-1920)
was followed by brutal Soviet rule that engineered two artificial famines
(1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died, and World War II, in
which German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 million more
deaths. Although independence was attained in 1991 with the dissolution of
the USSR, true freedom remains elusive as many of the former Soviet elite
remain entrenched, stalling efforts at economic reform, privatization,
and civil liberties.

Economy Ukraine

Economy - overview:  After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and
away the most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its
fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural
output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk,
grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy
industry supplied the unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes)
and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling
apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR. Ukraine depends on
imports of energy, especially natural gas, to meet some 85% of its
annual energy requirements. Shortly after independence in late 1991,
the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within
the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to
some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% the 1991
level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993.  Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy
supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have made the
Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Now in his second
term, President KUCHMA has pledged to reduce the number of government
agencies, streamline the regulatory process, create a legal environment
to encourage entrepreneurs, and enact a comprehensive tax overhaul.
Reforms in the more politically sensitive areas of structural reform and
land privatization are still lagging. Outside institutions - particularly
the IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms
and have threatened to withdraw financial support. GDP in 2000 showed
strong export-based growth of 6% - the first growth since independence -
and industrial production grew 12.9%. The economy continued to expand in
2001 as real GDP rose 9% and industrial output grew by over 14%. Growth
was undergirded by strong domestic demand and growing consumer and
investor confidence.

development plan, running through 2005, emphasizes improving domestic
trunk lines, international connections, and the mobile cellular
system domestic: at independence in December 1991, Ukraine inherited
a telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient, and in disrepair;
more than 3.5 million applications for telephones could not be satisfied;
telephone density is now rising slowly and the domestic trunk system
is being improved; the mobile cellular telephone system is expanding
at a high rate international: two new domestic trunk lines are a part
of the fiber-optic Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) system and three Ukrainian
links have been installed in the fiber-optic Trans-European Lines (TEL)
project which connects 18 countries; additional international service is

find a solution in two years and numerous talks; Russia and Ukraine
have successfully delimited land boundary in 2001, but disagree on
delimitation of maritime boundary in the Sea of Azov and Black Sea;
Moldovan difficulties with break-away Transnistria region inhibit
establishment of a joint customs regime with Ukraine to curtail smuggling,
arms transfers, and other illegal activities

Illicit drugs:  limited cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy, mostly
for CIS consumption; some synthetic drug production for export to West;
limited government eradication program; used as transshipment point for
opiates and other illicit drugs from Africa, Latin America, and Turkey,
and to Europe and Russia; drug-related money laundering a minor, but
growing, problem

United States

Introduction

United States

Background:  Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country
in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of
America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th
centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation
expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of
overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's
history were the Civil War (1861-65) and the Great Depression of the
1930s. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold
War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation-state. The
economy is marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,
and rapid advances in technology.

Economy United States

Economy - overview:  The US has the largest and most technologically
powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $36,300. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed
goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business
firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts
in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay
off surplus workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they
face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the
barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. US firms are at or near
the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in
medical, aerospace, and military equipment, although their advantage has
narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely
explains the gradual development of a "two-tier labor market" in which
those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical
skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable
pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975,
practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20%
of households. The years 1994-2000 witnessed solid increases in real
output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below 5%. The
year 2001 witnessed the end of the boom psychology and performance,
with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures
rising substantially. The response to the terrorist attacks of September
11 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. Moderate recovery is
expected in 2002, with the GDP growth rate rising to 2.5% or more. A major
short-term problem in first half 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock
market, fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in
some major corporations. Long-term problems include inadequate investment
in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of
an aging population, sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family
income in the lower economic groups.

Economy Burkina Faso

Economy - overview:  One of the poorest countries in the world,
landlocked Burkina Faso has a high population density, few natural
resources, and a fragile soil.  About 90% of the population is engaged
in (mainly subsistence) agriculture, which is highly vulnerable to
variations in rainfall.  Industry remains dominated by unprofitable
government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency
devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development
program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and
economic growth have increased. Maintenance of macroeconomic progress
depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit,
and reforms designed to encourage private investment.

Uruguay

Introduction

Uruguay

Background:  A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement, the Tupamaros,
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to agree to military
control of his administration in 1973. By the end of the year the rebels
had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold throughout
the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985.  Uruguay's
political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.

Economy Uruguay

Economy - overview:  Uruguay's economy is characterized by an
export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce,
and high levels of social spending. After averaging growth of 5%
annually in 1996-98, in 1999-2001 the economy suffered from lower
demand in Argentina and Brazil, which together account for nearly
half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the severity of the trade shocks,
Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its
neighbors, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its
investment-grade sovereign bond rating - one of only two in South America.
Challenges for the government of President Jorge BATLLE include reducing
the budget deficit, expanding Uruguay's trade ties beyond its Mercosur
trade partners, and reducing the costs of public services. GDP fell by
1.3% in 2000 and by 1.5% in 2001.

Uzbekistan

Introduction

Uzbekistan

Background:  Russia conquered Uzbekistan in the late 19th century. Stiff
resistance to the Red Army after World War I was eventually suppressed
and a socialist republic set up in 1924. During the Soviet era,
intensive production of "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse
of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have
left the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry.
Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its
dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum
reserves. Current concerns include insurgency by Islamic militants
based in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, a nonconvertible currency, and the
curtailment of human rights and democratization.

Geography Uzbekistan

Location:  Central Asia, north of Afghanistan

Geographic coordinates:  41 00 N, 64 00 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 447,400 sq km water: 22,000 sq km land: 425,400 sq km

Area - comparative:  slightly larger than California

Land boundaries:  total: 6,221 km border countries: Afghanistan 137
km, Kazakhstan 2,203 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,099 km, Tajikistan 1,161 km,
Turkmenistan 1,621 km

Coastline:  0 km (doubly landlocked); note - Uzbekistan includes the
southern portion of the Aral Sea with a 420 km shoreline

Maritime claims:  none (doubly landlocked)

Climate:  mostly midlatitude desert, long, hot summers, mild winters;
semiarid grassland in east

Terrain:  mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad,
flat intensely irrigated river valleys along course of Amu Darya, Syr
Darya (Sirdaryo), and Zarafshon; Fergana Valley in east surrounded by
mountainous Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; shrinking Aral Sea in west

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Sariqarnish Kuli -12 m highest point:
Adelunga Toghi 4,301 m

Natural resources:  natural gas, petroleum, coal, gold, uranium, silver,
copper, lead and zinc, tungsten, molybdenum

Land use:  arable land: 11% permanent crops: 1% other: 88% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  42,810 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  NA

Environment - current issues:  shrinkage of the Aral Sea is resulting in
growing concentrations of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these
substances are then blown from the increasingly exposed lake bed and
contribute to desertification; water pollution from industrial wastes
and the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides is the cause of many
human health disorders; increasing soil salination; soil contamination
from buried nuclear processing and agricultural chemicals, including DDT

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Biodiversity,
Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification,
Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes,
Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands signed, but not ratified: none of the
selected agreements

Economy Uzbekistan

Economy - overview:  Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 11%
consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. More than 60%
of its population lives in densely populated rural communities. Uzbekistan
is now the world's second largest cotton exporter, a large producer
of gold and oil, and a regionally significant producer of chemicals
and machinery.  Following independence in December 1991, the government
sought to prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and
tight controls on production and prices. The state continues to be
a dominating influence in the economy and has so far failed to bring
about much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's
$185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental
steps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions. Uzbekistan
has responded to the negative external conditions generated by the
Asian and Russian financial crises by emphasizing import substitute
industrialization and by tightening export and currency controls within
its already largely closed economy. Economic policies that have repelled
foreign investment are a major factor in the economy's stagnation. A
growing debt burden, persistent inflation, and a poor business climate led
to disappointing growth in 2001. However, in December 2001 the government
voiced a renewed interest in economic reform, seeking advice from the
IMF and other financial institutions.

Transnational Issues Uzbekistan

Disputes - international:  Uzbekistan border largely delimited with
Kazakhstan, but unresolved dispute remains over sovereignty of two border
villages, Bagys and Turkestan, and around the Arnasay dam; dispute over
access to Sokh and other Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyzstan mars progress on
international boundary delimitation; Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan
and Uzbekistan wrestle with sharing limited water resources and the
regional environmental degradation caused by the shrinking Aral Sea;
the undemarcated northern and western border with Uzbekistan is mined
in many sections

Illicit drugs:  limited illicit cultivation of cannabis and very small
amounts of opium poppy, mostly for domestic consumption, almost entirely
eradicated by an effective government eradication program; increasingly
used as transshipment point for illicit drugs from Afghanistan to Russia
and Western Europe and for acetic anhydride destined for Afghanistan

Economy Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Economy - overview:  Bananas and other agricultural products remain
the staple of this lower-middle income country's economy. Although
tourism and other services have been growing moderately in recent
years, the government has been ineffective at introducing new
industries. Unemployment remains high, and economic growth hinges upon
seasonal variations in the agricultural and tourism sectors. Tropical
storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994 and 1995, and
tourism in the Eastern Caribbean has suffered low arrivals following
September 11.  St. Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector,
but its restrictive secrecy laws have come under international review. As
of June 2001, it remained on the Financial Action Task Force's list of
noncooperative jurisdictions.

Introduction

Venezuela

Background:  Venezuela was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Colombia and
Ecuador). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was
ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil
industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically-elected
governments have held sway since 1959. Current concerns include:
an embattled president who is losing his once solid support among
Venezuelans, a divided military, drug-related conflicts along the
Colombian border, increasing internal drug consumption, overdependence
on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible
mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous
peoples.

Economy Venezuela

Economy - overview:  The petroleum sector dominates the economy,
accounting for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of export earnings,
and more than half of government operating revenues. Venezuelan
officials estimate that GDP grew by 2.7% in 2001. A strong rebound in
international oil prices fueled the recovery from the steep recession
in 1999. Nevertheless, a weak nonoil sector and capital flight - and
a temporary fall in oil prices - undercut the recovery. In early 2002,
President CHAVEZ changed the exchange rate regime from a crawling peg
to a free floating exchange rate, causing the bolivar to depreciate
significantly.

Economy British Virgin Islands

Economy - overview:  The economy, one of the most stable and prosperous in
the Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, generating an estimated 45%
of the national income. An estimated 350,000 tourists, mainly from the
US, visited the islands in 1998. In the mid-1980s, the government began
offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly
400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The
adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which provides
a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for
investigation of criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin
Islands even more attractive to international business. Livestock raising
is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands'
ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally
close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has
used the dollar as its currency since 1959.

Vietnam

Introduction

Vietnam

Background:  France occupied all of Vietnam by 1884. Independence was
declared after World War II, but the French continued to rule until
1954 when they were defeated by Communist forces under Ho Chi MINH,
who took control of the north. US economic and military aid to South
Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government,
but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in
1973. Two years later North Vietnamese forces overran the south. Economic
reconstruction of the reunited country has proven difficult as aging
Communist Party leaders have only grudgingly initiated reforms necessary
for a free market.

Economy Vietnam

Economy - overview:  Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of financial support
from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally planned
economy. Substantial progress was achieved from 1986 to 1996 in moving
forward from an extremely low starting point - growth averaged around 9%
per year from 1993 to 1997. The 1997 Asian financial crisis highlighted
the problems in the Vietnamese economy but, rather than prompting reform,
reaffirmed the government's belief that shifting to a market oriented
economy leads to disaster. GDP growth of 8.5% in 1997 fell to 6% in 1998
and 5% in 1999. Growth then rose to 6.8% in 2000 and dropped back to
4.7% in 2001 against the background of global recession. These numbers
mask some major difficulties in economic performance. Many domestic
industries, including coal, cement, steel, and paper, have reported
large stockpiles of inventory and tough competition from more efficient
foreign producers. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities have moved slowly
in implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the economy
and produce more competitive, export-driven industries. The US-Vietnam
Bilateral Trade Agreement entered into force near the end of 2001 and is
expected to significantly increase Vietnam's exports to the US. The US
is assisting Vietnam with implementing the legal and structural reforms
called for in the agreement.

Virgin Islands

Introduction

Virgin Islands

Background:  During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided into
two territorial units, one English and the other Danish. Sugarcane,

which had been in economic decline since the abolition of slavery in 1848.

Economy Virgin Islands

Economy - overview:  Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting
for more than 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. The islands normally
host 2 million visitors a year. The manufacturing sector consists of
petroleum refining, textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and watch
assembly. The agricultural sector is small, with most food being imported.
International business and financial services are a small but growing
component of the economy. One of the world's largest petroleum refineries
is at Saint Croix. The islands are subject to substantial damage from
storms. The government is working to improve fiscal discipline, support
construction projects in the private sector, expand tourist facilities,
reduce crime, and protect the environment.

Holy See (Vatican City)

Introduction Holy See (Vatican City)

Background:  Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian
peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century,
when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of
Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome
itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner" popes and
Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established
the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism
special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See
and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including
the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present
concerns of the Holy See include the failing health of Pope John Paul II,
interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the adjustment of church
doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1 billion
people worldwide profess the Catholic faith.

Namibia

Introduction

Namibia

Background:  South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa
during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World
War II when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist South-West
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war
of independence for the area that was soon named Namibia, but it was
not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in
accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region.  Independence came
in 1990.

Economy Namibia

Economy - overview:  The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of
GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in
Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds.
Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
and tungsten. About half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per
capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's
people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale unemployment,
the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of
wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to South
Africa. Agreement has been reached on the privatization of several more
enterprises in coming years, which should stimulate long-run foreign
investment.

West Bank

Introduction West Bank

Background:  The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers
and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West
Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the
Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron,
the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September
1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain
responsibility during the transitional period for external security
and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israeli
citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza
and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus,
but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September
2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian
Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

Economy West Bank

Economy - overview:  Economic output in the West Bank is governed
by the Paris Economic Protocol of April 1994 between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. Real per capita GDP for the West Bank and
Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined by about one-third between 1992 and 1996
due to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and rapid
population growth. The downturn in economic activity was largely the
result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of border closures
in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted labor
and commodity market relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The
most serious social effect of this downturn was rising unemployment;
unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was generally under 5%; by
1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's use of comprehensive closures
during the next five years decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new
policies to reduce the impact of closures and other security procedures
on the movement of Palestinian goods and labor.  These changes fueled
an almost three-year-long economic recovery in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended
in the last quarter of 2000 with the outbreak of Palestinian violence,
which triggered tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas
and severely disrupted trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even
more severely in 2002, internal turmoil and Israeli military measures
in Palestinian Authority areas have resulted in the destruction of much
capital plant and administrative structure, widespread business closures,
and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been the decline in
earnings of Palestinian workers in Israel.

Background:  Although discovered by the Dutch and the British in the
17th and 18th centuries, it was the French who declared a protectorate
over the islands in 1842. In 1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted
to become a French overseas territory.

Western Sahara

Introduction

Western Sahara

Background:  Morocco virtually annexed the northern two-thirds of
Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) in 1976, and the rest of the
territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla war
with the Polisario Front contesting Rabat's sovereignty ended in a 1991
cease-fire; a referendum on final status has been repeatedly postponed.

Geography Western Sahara

Climate:  hot, dry desert; rain is rare; cold offshore air currents
produce fog and heavy dew

Terrain:  mostly low, flat desert with large areas of rocky or sandy
surfaces rising to small mountains in south and northeast

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Sebjet Tah -55 m highest point:

Natural hazards:  hot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind can occur
during winter and spring; widespread harmattan haze exists 60% of time,
often severely restricting visibility

Environment - current issues:  sparse water and lack of arable land

Government type:  legal status of territory and issue of sovereignty
unresolved; territory contested by Morocco and Polisario Front (Popular
Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro), which in
February 1976 formally proclaimed a government-in-exile of the Sahrawi
Arab Democratic Republic (SADR),led by President Mohamed ABDELAZIZ and
recognized by 54 nations; territory partitioned between Morocco and
Mauritania in April 1976, with Morocco acquiring northern two-thirds;
Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all
claims to its portion in August 1979; Morocco moved to occupy that sector
shortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control; the
Polisario's government-in-exile was seated as an OAU member in 1984;
guerrilla activities continued sporadically, until a UN-monitored
cease-fire was implemented 6 September 1991

Economy Western Sahara

Economy - overview:  Western Sahara depends on pastoral nomadism,
fishing, and phosphate mining as the principal sources of income for
the population. The territory lacks sufficient rainfall for sustainable
agricultural production, and most of the food for the urban population
must be imported. All trade and other economic activities are controlled
by the Moroccan Government. Moroccan energy interests in 2001 signed
contracts to explore for oil off the coast of Western Sahara, which has
angered the Polisario. Incomes and standards of living in Western Sahara
are substantially below the Moroccan level.

Economy Samoa

Economy - overview:  The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent
on development aid, family remittances from overseas, and agricultural
exports. The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. Agriculture
employs two-thirds of the labor force, and furnishes 90% of exports,
featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The manufacturing sector
mainly processes agricultural products. The decline of fish stocks in the
area is a continuing problem. Tourism is an expanding sector, accounting
for 16% of GDP; about 85,000 tourists visited the islands in 2000. The
Samoan Government has called for deregulation of the financial sector,
encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline. Observers
point to the flexibility of the labor market as a basic strength for
future economic advances. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy
state, the external debt is stable, and inflation is low.

Economy Swaziland

Economy - overview:  In this small landlocked economy, subsistence
agriculture occupies more than 80% of the population. Manufacturing
features a number of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined in
importance in recent years: diamond mines have shut down because of the
depletion of easily accessible reserves; high-grade iron ore deposits
were depleted by 1978; and health concerns have cut world demand for
asbestos. Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar, and wood pulp are
the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except
for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on
South Africa from which it receives nine-tenths of its imports and to
which it sends more than two-thirds of its exports.  Remittances from the
Southern African Customs Union and Swazi workers in South African mines
substantially supplement domestically earned income. The government is
trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign investment. Overgrazing,
soil depletion, drought, and sometimes floods persist as problems for
the future.  Prospects for 2002 are strengthened by the country's status
as a beneficiary of the US African Growth and Opportunity Act initiative.

Indian Ocean

Introduction

Indian Ocean

Background:  The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five
oceans (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than
the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important access
waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb (Djibouti-Yemen),
Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia).

Geography Indian Ocean

Location:  body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia,
and Australia

Geographic coordinates:  20 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references:  Political Map of the World

Area:  total: 68.556 million sq km note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian
Sea, Bay of Bengal, Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman,
Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other
tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:  about 5.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:  66,526 km

Climate:  northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June
to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November
in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in the southern
Indian Ocean

Terrain:  surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular
system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric pressure
over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest
monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents, while high pressure
over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in the northeast
monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and currents; ocean floor is
dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast
Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m highest point:
sea level 0 m

Natural resources:  oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel
aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Natural hazards:  occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in
southern reaches

Environment - current issues:  endangered marine species include the
dugong, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea,
Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

Geography - note:  major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of
Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the
Lombok Strait

People Indian Ocean

Population growth rate:  NA%

Economy Indian Ocean

Economy - overview:  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting
the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It
carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products
from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of
great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic
consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp
and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western Australia.
An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the
Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer
deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly
India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

Transportation Indian Ocean

Ports and harbors:  Chennai (Madras; India), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Durban
(South Africa), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (Calcutta; India) Melbourne
(Australia), Mumbai (Bombay; India), Richards Bay (South Africa)

Transnational Issues Indian Ocean

Arctic Ocean

Introduction

Arctic Ocean

Background:  The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans
(after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the recently
delimited Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US and Canada) and
Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two important seasonal
waterways. A sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes
circumscribes the Arctic Ocean.

Geography Arctic Ocean

Location:  body of water between Europe, Asia, and North America, mostly
north of the Arctic Circle

Geographic coordinates:  90 00 N, 0 00 E

Map references:  Arctic Region

Area:  total: 14.056 million sq km note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents
Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea,
Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage,
and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:  45,389 km

Climate:  polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak
cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain:  central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack
that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may
be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral
Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New Siberian Islands
(Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the icepack is
surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size
during the winter and extends to the encircling landmasses; the ocean
floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean)
with the remainder a central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges
(Alpha Cordillera, Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Fram Basin -4,665 m highest point:
sea level 0 m

Natural resources:  sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
and whales)

Natural hazards:  ice islands occasionally break away from northern
Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland
and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually ice
locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from
October to May

Environment - current issues:  endangered marine species include walruses
and whales; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack

Geography - note:  major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern
access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location
between North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the
extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations
operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April
about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about
10 months

People Arctic Ocean

Population growth rate:  NA%

Economy Arctic Ocean

Economy - overview:  Economic activity is limited to the exploitation
of natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.

Transportation Arctic Ocean

Ports and harbors:  Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay
(US)

Transportation - note:  sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land
routes; the Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route
(Eurasia) are important seasonal waterways

Transnational Issues Arctic Ocean

Disputes - international:  some maritime disputes (see littoral states);
Russia is the first state to submit data to the UN Commission on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend its continental shelf by
claiming two undersea ridges in the Arctic Ocean

World

Introduction

World

Background:  Globally, the 20th century was marked by: (a) two devastating
world wars; (b) the Great Depression of the 1930s; (c) the end of
vast colonial empires; (d) rapid advances in science and technology,
from the first airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (US) to
the landing on the moon; (e) the Cold War between the Western alliance
and the Warsaw Pact nations; (f) a sharp rise in living standards in
North America, Europe, and Japan; (g) increased concerns about the
environment, including loss of forests, shortages of energy and water,
the decline in biological diversity, and air pollution; (h) the onset of
the AIDS epidemic; and (i) the ultimate emergence of the US as the only
world superpower. The planet's population continues to explode: from 1
billion in 1820, to 2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in
1974, 5 billion in 1988, and 6 billion in 2000. For the 21st century,
the continued exponential growth in science and technology raises both
hopes (e.g., advances in medicine) and fears (e.g., development of even
more lethal weapons of war).

Area:  total: 510.072 million sq km land: 148.94 million sq km water:
361.132 million sq km note: 70.8% of the world's surface is water, 29.2%

Area - comparative:  land area about 16 times the size of the US

Land boundaries:  the land boundaries in the world total 250,472 km
(not counting shared boundaries twice)

Coastline:  356,000 km

Maritime claims:  a variety of situations exist, but in general, most
countries make the following claims: contiguous zone - 24 NM; continental
shelf - 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation, or 200 NM or to the
edge of the continental margin; exclusive fishing zone - 200 NM; exclusive
economic zone - 200 NM; territorial sea - 12 NM; boundary situations with
neighboring states prevent many countries from extending their fishing
or economic zones to a full 200 NM; 43 nations and other areas that are
landlocked include Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central
African Republic, Chad, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Holy See (Vatican
City), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liechtenstein,

Rwanda, San Marino, Slovakia, Swaziland, Switzerland, Tajikistan, The
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan,
West Bank, Zambia, Zimbabwe; two of these, Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan,
are doubly landlocked

Climate:  two large areas of polar climates separated by two rather
narrow temperate zones form a wide equatorial band of tropical to
subtropical climates

Terrain:  the greatest ocean depth is the Mariana Trench at 10,924 m in
the Pacific Ocean

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,540 m
note: in the oceanic realm, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is
the lowest point, lying -10,924 m below the surface of the Pacific Ocean
highest point: Natural resources:  the rapid depletion of nonrenewable
mineral resources, the depletion of forest areas and wetlands, the
extinction of animal and plant species, and the deterioration in air and
water quality (especially in Eastern Europe, the former USSR, and China)
pose serious long-term problems that governments and peoples are only
beginning to address

Land use:  arable land: 11% permanent crops: 1% other: 88% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  2,714,320 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  large areas subject to severe weather (tropical
cyclones), natural disasters (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis,
volcanic eruptions)

Environment - current issues:  large areas subject to overpopulation,
industrial disasters, pollution (air, water, acid rain, toxic substances),
loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss
of wildlife, soil degradation, soil depletion, erosion

Economy World

Economy - overview:  Growth in global output (gross world product, GWP)
fell from 4.8% in 2000 to 2.2% in 2001. The causes: slowdowns in the US
economy (21% of GWP) and in the 15 EU economies (20% of GWP); continued
stagnation in the Japanese economy (7.3% of GWP); and spillover effects
in the less developed regions of the world. China, the second largest
economy in the world (12% of GWP), proved an exception, continuing its
rapid annual growth, officially announced as 7.3% but estimated by many
observers as perhaps two percentage points lower. Russia (2.6% of GWP),
with 5.2% growth, continued to make uneven progress, its GDP per capita
still only one-third that of the leading industrial nations. The other 14
successor nations of the USSR and the other old Warsaw Pact nations again
experienced widely divergent growth rates; the three Baltic nations were
strong performers, in the 5% range of growth. The developing nations also
varied in their growth results, with many countries facing population
increases that eat up gains in output. Externally, the nation-state, as
a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.  Internally,
the central government often finds its control over resources slipping
as separatist regional movements - typically based on ethnicity -
gain momentum, e.g., in many of the successor states of the former
Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, in Indonesia, and
in Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is
exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment,
epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal problems and
priorities, the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources
to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least
from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. The
introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of Western
Europe in January 1999, while paving the way for an integrated economic
powerhouse, poses economic risks because of varying levels of income
and cultural and political differences among the participating nations.
The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuate a
further growing risk to global prosperity, illustrated, for example,
by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist
programs. (For specific economic developments in each country of the
world in 2001, see the individual country entries.)

Background:  The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in
1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Occupation by Nazi
Germany in 1941 was resisted by various paramilitary bands that fought
themselves as well as the invaders. The group headed by Marshal TITO
took full control upon German expulsion in 1945. Although Communist,
his new government successfully steered its own path between the Warsaw
Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In the
early 1990s, post-TITO Yugoslavia began to unravel along ethnic lines:
Slovenia, Croatia, and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia all
declared their independence in 1991; Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. The
remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new "Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia" (FRY)in 1992 and, under President Slobodan
MILOSEVIC, Serbia led various military intervention efforts to unite
Serbs in neighboring republics into a "Greater Serbia." All of these
efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In 1999, massive expulsions by
FRY forces and Serb paramilitaries of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo
provoked an international response, including the NATO bombing of Serbia
and the stationing of NATO and Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo. There are
Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS)-led coalitions governing at the
federal and Serbian Republic levels, implementing a wide-ranging political
and economic reform program.  The governing coalition in Montenegro is
seeking independence from the Federation. Kosovo has been governed by
the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) since June 1999,
under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.

Economy Yugoslavia

Economy - overview:  MILOSEVIC-era mismanagement of the economy, an
extended period of economic sanctions, and the damage to Yugoslavia's
infrastructure and industry during the war in Kosovo has left the economy
only half the size it was in 1990. Since the ousting of former Federal
Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in October 2000, the Democratic Opposition of
Serbia (DOS) coalition government has implemented stabilization measures
and embarked on an aggressive market reform program. After renewing
its membership in the IMF in December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to
reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World
Bank (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD). A World Bank-European Commission sponsored Donors' Conference
held in June 2001 raised $1.3 billion for economic restructuring. An
agreement rescheduling the country's $4.5 billion Paris Club government
debts was concluded in November 2001; it will write off 66% of the debt
and provide a basis for Belgrade to seek similar debt relief on its $2.8
billion London Club commercial debt. The smaller republic of Montenegro
severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the
MILOSEVIC era and continues to maintain it's own central bank, uses the
euro instead of the Yugoslav dinar as official currency, collects customs
tariffs, and manages its own budget.  Kosovo, while technically still
part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia according to United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1244, is moving toward local autonomy under
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and is
dependent on the international community for financial and technical
assistance. The euro and the Yugoslav dinar are official currencies,
and UNMIK collects taxes and manages the budget.

Introduction

Yemen

Background:  North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in
1918. The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern
port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became
South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist
orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from
the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the
states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen
in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in 1994 was quickly subdued. In
2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border.

Economy Yemen

Economy - overview:  Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab
world, reported strong growth in the mid-1990s with the onset of oil
production, but has been harmed by periodic declines in oil prices. Yemen
has embarked on an IMF-supported structural adjustment program designed to
modernize and streamline the economy, which has led to substantial foreign
debt relief and restructuring. Aided by higher oil prices in 1999-2000,
Yemen worked to maintain tight control over spending and implement
additional components of the IMF program. A high population growth rate
and internal political dissension complicate the government's task.

Introduction

Zambia

Background:  The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by
the South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the
UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred
development and immigration.  The name was changed to Zambia upon
independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices
and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought
an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant
harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by
administrative problems with at least two parties filing legal petitions
challenging the results. Opposition parties currently hold a majority
of seats in the National Assembly.

Economy Zambia

Economy - overview:  Despite progress in privatization and budgetary
reform, Zambia's economy has a long way to go. Privatization of
government-owned copper mines relieved the government from covering
mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the
chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic
growth. However, low mineral prices have slowed the benefits from
privatizing the mines and reduced incentives for further private
investment in the sector. In late 2000, Zambia was determined to be
eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative, but Zambia has not yet finalized its Poverty Reduction
Strategy paper.  Unemployment rates remain high, but GDP growth should
continue at about 4%. Inflation should remain close to 20%.

Atlantic Ocean

Introduction

Atlantic Ocean

Background:  The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's
five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean,
Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany), Oresund
(Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar (Morocco-Spain),
and the St.  Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are important strategic access
waterways.

Geography Atlantic Ocean

Location:  body of water between Africa, Europe, the Southern Ocean,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates:  0 00 N, 25 00 W

Map references:  Political Map of the World

Area:  total: 76.762 million sq km note: includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea,
Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage,
Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all
of the Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:  slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:  111,866 km

Climate:  tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa
near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can
occur from May to December, but are most frequent from August to November

Terrain:  surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark
Strait, and coastal portions of the Baltic Sea from October to June;
clockwise warm-water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the
northern Atlantic, counterclockwise warm-water gyre in the southern
Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico
Trench -8,605 m highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:  oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
and whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic
nodules, precious stones

Natural hazards:  icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and
the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been
spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; ships subject
to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from October to May;
persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September; hurricanes
(May to December)

Environment - current issues:  endangered marine species include the
manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales; drift net fishing is
hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international
disputes; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil,
and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico,
Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and
municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea

Zimbabwe

Introduction

Zimbabwe

Background:  The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the South Africa
Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in
power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but
the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights
for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN
sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979
and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980.  Robert MUGABE, the nation's first
prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since
1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence.

Economy Zimbabwe

Economy - overview:  The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety
of difficult economic problems as it struggles to consolidate earlier
moves to develop a market-oriented economy. Its involvement in the
war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, has already
drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. Badly needed
support from the IMF has been suspended because of the country's failure
to meet budgetary goals. Inflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in
1998 to 59% in 1999, to 60% in 2000, and to 100% by yearend 2001. The
economy is being steadily weakened by excessive government deficits,
AIDS, and rampant inflation. The government's land reform program,
characterized by chaos and violence, has derailed the commercial sector,
the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider
of 400,000 jobs. Distribution of income is extremely unequal.

Pacific Ocean

Introduction

Pacific Ocean

Background:  The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans
(followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic
Ocean).  Strategically important access waterways include the La Perouse,
Tsugaru, Tsushima, Taiwan, Singapore, and Torres Straits.

Geography Pacific Ocean

Location:  body of water between the Southern Ocean, Asia, Australia,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates:  0 00 N, 160 00 W

Map references:  Political Map of the World

Area:  total: 155.557 million sq km note: includes Bali Sea, Bering Sea,
Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska,
Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea
of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary
water bodies

Area - comparative:  about 15 times the size of the US; covers about 28%
of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the world

Coastline:  135,663 km

Climate:  planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds
and westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America; continental
influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less pronounced in the
eastern and western regions at the same latitude in the North Pacific
Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during
the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over
the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow
from the Asian landmass back to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons)
may strike southeast and east Asia from May to December

Terrain:  surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the
southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern
Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter;
in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost
extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated
by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep
trenches, including the Mariana Trench, which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench
-10,924 m highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:  oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards:  surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake
activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of Fire"; subject
to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May
to December (most frequent from July to October); tropical cyclones
(hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike Central America and
Mexico from June to October (most common in August and September);
cyclical El Nino/La Nina phenomenon occurs in the equatorial Pacific,
influencing weather in the Western Hemisphere and the western Pacific;
ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to
May; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard
from June to December

Environment - current issues:  endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Geography - note:  the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides
the Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
southwestern Pacific Ocean

People Pacific Ocean

Population growth rate:  NA%

Economy Pacific Ocean

Economy - overview:  The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals,
and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60%
of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of
offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the
energy supplies of US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru. The high cost of
recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world
prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.

Transportation Pacific Ocean

Ports and harbors:  Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Kao-hsiung (Taiwan),
Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco
(US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia),
Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)

Transportation - note:  Inside Passage offers protected waters from
southeast Alaska to Puget Sound (Washington state)

Appendix D --Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes

 FIPS 10-4:
 Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal
Administrative Divisions (FIPS PUB 10-4) is maintained by the Office of
the Geographer and Global Issues (Department of State) and published by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Department of Commerce).
FIPS 10-4 codes are intended for general use throughout the US Government,
especially in activities associated with the mission of the Department of
State and national defense programs.

 ISO 3166:
 Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries (ISO 3166) is prepared
by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 3166 includes
two- and three-character alphabetic codes and three-digit numeric codes that
may be needed for activities involving exchange of data with international
organizations that have adopted that standard. Except for the numeric codes,
ISO 3166 codes have been adopted in the US as FIPS 104-1:American National
Standard Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries, Dependencies,
and Areas of Special Sovereignty for Information Interchange.

 Internet:
 The Internet country code is the two-letter digraph maintained by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2
list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to establish
country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).

The US Government has not yet adopted a standard for hydrographic codes
similar to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 10-4 country
codes. The names and limits of the following oceans and seas are not always
directly comparable because of differences in the customers, needs, and
requirements of the individual organizations. Even the number of principal
water bodies varies from organization to organization. Factbook users, for
example, find the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean entries useful, but none
of the following standards include those oceans in their entirety. Nor is
there any provision for combining codes or overcodes to aggregate water
bodies.The recently delimited Southern Ocean is not included.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
