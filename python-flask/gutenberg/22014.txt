  PETER PATTER _told them to me,
  All the little rimes,
  Whispered them among the bushes
  Half a hundred times.

  Peter lives upon a mountain
  Pretty near the sun,
  Knows the bears and birds and rabbits
  Nearly every one;
  Has a home among the alders,
  Bed of cedar bark,
  Walks alone beneath the pine trees
  Even when it's dark.

  Squirrels tell him everything
  That happens in the trees,
  Cricket in the gander-grass
  Sings of all he sees;
  Rimes from bats and butterflies,
  Crabs and waterfowl;
  But the best of all he gets
  From his Uncle Owl.

  Sometimes when its day-time,
  But mostly in the night,
  They sit beneath an oak tree
  And hug each other tight,
  And tell their rimes and riddles
  Where the catty creatures prowl--
  Funny little Peter Patter
  And his Uncle Owl._

  THE PETER PATTER BOOK


  [Illustration: --B. F. Wright--
  JINGLE, JINGLE, JACK, A COPPER DOWN A CRACK]

  A COPPER DOWN A CRACK


  Jingle, jingle, Jack,
  A copper down a crack.
  Twenty men and all their wives,
  With sticks and picks and pocket knives,
  Digging for their very lives
  To get the copper back.




  I'M MUCH TOO BIG FOR A FAIRY


  I'm much too big for a fairy,
  And much too small for a man,
  But this is true:
  Whatever I do,
  I do it the best I can.




  DID YOU EVER PLAY TAG WITH A TIGER?


  Did you ever play tag with a tiger,
  Or ever play boo with a bear;
  Did you ever put rats in the rain-barrel
  To give poor old Granny a scare?

  It's fun to play tag with a tiger,
  It's fun for the bear to say "boo,"
  But if rats are found in the rain-barrel
  Old Granny will put you in too.




  [Illustration]

  THE BLUE SONG


  Hot mush and molasses all in a blue bowl--
  Eat it, it's good for you, sonny.
  'T will make you grow tall as a telephone pole--
  Eat it, it's good for you, sonny.

  Fresh fish and potatoes all on a blue plate--
  Eat it up smart now, my sonny.
  'T will make you as jolly and fat as Aunt Kate--
  Eat it up quick now, my sonny.

  Sweet milk from a nanny-goat in a blue cup--
  Drink it, it's good for you, sonny,
  'T will fill you, expand you, and help you grow up,
  And make a real man of you, sonny.




  HIPPITY HOP TO BED


  O it's hippity hop to bed!
  I'd rather sit up instead.
  But when father says "must,"
  There's nothing but just
  Go hippity hop to bed.

  [Illustration]




  [Illustration]

  AWAY TO THE RIVER


  Away to the river, away to the wood,
  While the grasses are green and the berries are good!
  Where the locusts are scraping their fiddles and bows,
  And the bees keep a-coming wherever one goes.

  Oh, it's off to the river and off to the hills,
  To the land of the bloodroot and wild daffodils,
  With a buttercup blossom to color my chin,
  And a basket of burs to put sandberries in.




  [Illustration]

  OUR LITTLE PAT


  Our little Pat
  Was chasing the cat
  And kicking the kittens about.
  When mother said "Quit!"
  He ran off to sit
  On the top of the woodpile and pout;
  But a sly little grin
  Soon slid down his chin
  And let all the sulkiness out.




  THE ANIMAL SHOW


  Father and mother and Bobbie will go
  To see all the sights at the animal show.
  Where lions and bears
  Sit on dining room chairs,
  Where a camel is able
  To stand on a table,
  Where monkeys and seals
  All travel on wheels,
  And a Zulu baboon
  Rides a baby balloon.
  The sooner you're ready, the sooner we'll go.
  Aboard, all aboard, for the Animal Show!

  [Illustration: THE ANIMAL SHOW]




  TOMMY TRIMBLE


  Billy be nimble,
  Hurry and see
  Old Tommy Trimble
  Climbing a tree.
  He claws with his fingers
  And digs with his toes.
  The longer he lingers
  The slower he goes.




  [Illustration]

  DICKIE, DICKIE DEXTER


  Dickie, Dickie Dexter
  Had a wife and vexed her.
  She put him in a rabbit cage
  And fed him peppermint and sage--
  Dickie, Dickie Dexter.




  ON THE ROAD TO TATTLETOWN


  On the road to Tattletown
  What is this I see?
  A pig upon a pedestal,
  A cabbage up a tree,
  A rabbit cutting capers
  With a twenty dollar bill--
  Now if I don't get to Tattletown
  Then no one ever will.




  POLLY AND PETER


  Polly had some china cows
  And Peter had a gun.
  She turned the bossies out to browse,
  And Peterkin, for fun,
  Just peppered them with butter beans
  And blew them all to smithereens.

         *       *       *

  Now what will pretty Polly do
  For milk and cream and butter too?




  I WENT TO TOWN ON MONDAY


  I went to town on Monday
  To buy myself a coat,
  But on the way I met a man
  Who traveled with a caravan,
  And bought a billy-goat.

  I went to town on Tuesday
  And bought a fancy vest.
  I kept the pretty bucklestraps,
  Buttonholes and pocketflaps,
  And threw away the rest.

  [Illustration]

  I went to town on Thursday
  To buy a loaf of bread,
  But when I got there, goodness sakes!
  The town was full of rattlesnakes--
  The bakers all were dead.

  [Illustration]

  I went to town on Saturday
  To get myself a wife,
  But when I saw the lady fair
  I gnashed my teeth and pulled my hair
  And scampered for my life.




  [Illustration]

  WHERE ARE YOU GOING?


  Where are you going, sister Kate?
  I'm going to swing on the garden gate,
  And watch the fairy gypsies dance
  Their tim-tam-tum on the cabbage-plants--
  The great big one with the purple nose,
  And the tiny tad with the pinky toes.

  Where are you going, brother Ben?
  I'm going to build a tiger-pen.
  I'll get iron and steel and 'lectric wire
  And build it a hundred feet, or higher,
  And put ten tigers in it too,
  And a big wildcat, and--mebbe--you.

  [Illustration]

  Where are you going, mother mine?
  I'm going to sit by the old grapevine,
  And watch the gliding swallow bring
  Clay for her nest from the meadow spring--
  Clay and straw and a bit of thread
  To weave it into a baby's bed.

  [Illustration]

  Where are you going, grandma dear?
  I'm going, love, where the skies are clear,
  And the light winds lift the poppy flowers
  And gather clouds for the summer showers,
  Where the old folks and the children play
  On the warm hillside through the livelong day.




  CHRISTOPHER CRUMP


  Christopher Crump,
  All in a lump,
  Sits like a toad on the top of a stump.
  He stretches and sighs,
  And blinks with his eyes,
  Bats at the beetles and fights off the flies.

  PINKY, PINKY, PANG


  A tortoise sat on a slippery limb
  And played his pinky pang
  For a dog-fish friend that called on him,
  And this is what he sang:
  "Oh, the skies are blue,
  And I wait for you
  To come where the willows hang,
  And dance all night
  By the white moonlight
  To my pinky, pinky, pang!"




  TICK, TOCK


  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  Forty 'leven by the clock.
  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  Put your ear to Grandpa's ticker,
  Like a pancake, only thicker.
  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  Catch a squirrel in half a minute,
  Grab a sack and stick him in it.
  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  Mister Bunny feeds on honey,
  Tea, and taters--ain't it funny?
  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  When he goes to bed at night,
  Shoves his slippers out of sight;
  That is why Old Fox, the sinner,
  Had to go without his dinner.
  Tick, tock! Tick, tock!
  So says Grandpa's clock.

  UNDER THE WILLOW


  Put down your pillow under the willow,
  Hang up your hat in the sun,
  And lie down to snooze as long as you choose,
  For the plowing and sowing are done.

  Pick up your pillow from under the willow,
  And clamber out into the sun.
  Get a fork and a rake for goodness' sake,
  For the harvest time has begun.




  HIGH ON THE MANTEL


  High on the mantel rose a moan--
  It came from an idol carved in bone--
  "Oh, it's so lonesome here alone,
  With no one near to love me!"

  A cautious smile came over the face
  Of a pensive maid on a Grecian vase
  "Are you sure," she said, with charming grace,
  "There's no one near to love you?"

  BOOTS, BOOTS, BOOTS


  Buster's got a popper gun,
  A reg'lar one that shoots,
  And Teddy's got an engine
  With a whistler that toots.
  But I've got something finer yet--
  A pair of rubber boots.
  Oh, it's boots, boots, boots,
  A pair of rubber boots!
  I could walk from here to China
  In a pair of rubber boots.

  BUTTERFLY


  Butterfly, butterfly,
  Sit on my chin,
  Your wings are like tinsel,
  So yellow and thin.

  Butterfly, butterfly,
  Give me a kiss;
  If you give me a dozen
  There's nothing amiss.

  Butterfly, butterfly,
  Off to the flowers,--
  Wee, soulless sprite
  Of the long summer hours.




  BEELA BY THE SEA


  Catch a floater, catch an eel,
  Catch a lazy whale,
  Catch an oyster by the heel
  And put him in a pail.

  There's lots of work for Uncle Ike,
  Fatty Ford and me
  All day long and half the night
  At Beela by the sea.

  A MATTER OF TASTE


  "Thank you, dear," said the big black ant,
  "I'd like to go home with you now, but I can't.
  I have to hurry and milk my cows--
  The aphid herds on the aster boughs."
  And the ladybug said: "No doubt it's fine,
  This milk you get from your curious kine,
  But you know quite well it's my belief
  Your cows are best when turned to beef."




  TOMMY, MY SON


  "Tommy, my son," said the old tabby cat,
  "Go catch us some mice, and be sure that they're fat.
  There's one family lives in the carpenter's barn;
  They've made them a nest of the old lady's yarn.
  But the carpenter has a young cat of his own
  That is healthy and proud and almost full grown,
  And consider it, son, an eternal disgrace
  To come home at night with a scratch on your face."

  [Illustration]




  OH, SAID THE WORM


  "Oh," said the worm,
  "I'm awfully tired of sitting in the trees;
  I want to be a butterfly
  And chase the bumblebees."

  BUZZY BROWN


  Buzzy Brown came home from town
  As crazy as a loon,
  He wore a purple overcoat
  And sang a Sunday tune.

  Buzzy Brown came home from town
  As proud as he could be,
  He found three doughnuts and a bun
  A-growing on a tree.




  THE WIND


  The wind came a-whooping, down Cranberry Hill
  And stole an umbrella from, Mother Medill.

  It picked up a paper on Patterson's place
  And carried it clean to the Rockaby Race.

  And what was more shocking and awful than that,
  It blew the new feather off grandmother's hat.

  [Illustration: THE WIND CAME A-WHOOPING DOWN CRANBERRY HILL]




  THE HOBO BAND


  The roads are good and the weather's grand,
  So I'm off to play in the Hobo Band;
  With a gaspipe flute and a cowhide drum
  I'm going to make the music come.
  With a toot, toot, toot, and a dum, dum, dum,
  Just hear me make the music come!

  A BEETLE ON A BROOMSTRAW


  A robin and a wren, as they walked along one night,
  Saw a big brown beetle on a broomstraw.
  Said the robin to the wren: "What a pretty, pretty sight--
  That big brown beetle on a broomstraw!"
  So they got their plates and knives,
  Their children and their wives,
  And gobbled up the beetle on the broomstraw.




  MULE THOUGHTS


  A silly little mule
  Sat on a milking stool
  And tried to write a letter to his father.
  But he couldn't find the ink,
  So he said: "I rather think
  This writing letters home is too much bother."

  A CANDLE, A CANDLE


  A candle, a candle
  To light me to bed;
  A pillow, a pillow
  To tuck up my head.
  The moon is as sleepy as sleepy can be,
  The stars are all pointing their fingers at me,
  And Missus Hop-Robin, way up in her nest,
  Is rocking her tired little babies to rest.
  So give me a blanket
  To tuck up my toes,
  And a little soft pillow
  To snuggle my nose.

  BAXTER


  Baxter had a billy-goat
  Wall-eyed and double jointed.
  He took him to the barber shop
  And had his head anointed.




  LODDY, GIN, AND ELLA ZANDER


  Loddy, Gin, and Ella Zander
  Rode to market on a gander;
  Bought a crane for half a dollar;
  Loddy led him by the collar.

  Mister Crane said: "Hi there, master,
  Can't you make your legs work faster?
  We can't poke along this way."
  Then he slowly flew away.
  Loddy held him fast, you bet,
  And he hasn't come home yet.




  AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL


  As I was going down the hill
  In front of Missus Knapp's
  I saw the little Knapperines
  All in their winter wraps--
  Purple mitts and mufflers
  And knitted jersey caps.

  As I was coming back again
  In front of Missus Knapp's
  I saw that awful lady
  Give about a dozen slaps
  To every little Knapperine--
  I thought it was, perhaps,
  Because they gathered stickers
  In their knitted jersey caps.

  A LITTLE BOY RAN TO THE END OF THE SKY


  A little boy ran to the end of the sky
  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.
  He cried: "Three cheers for the Fourth of July!"
  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.

  He saw three little donkeys at play,
  He tickled their noses to make them bray,
  And he didn't come back until Christmas Day--
  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.




  DISCRETION


  A man with a nickel,
  A sword, and a sickle,
  A pipe, and a paper of pins
  Set out for the Niger
  To capture a tiger--
  And that's how my story begins.

  When he saw the wide ocean,
  He soon took a notion
  'T would be nicer to stay with his friends.
  So he traded his hat
  For a tortoise-shell cat--
  And that's how the chronicle ends.

  A BEETLE ONCE SAT ON A BARBERRY TWIG


  A beetle once sat on a barberry twig,
  And turned at the crank of a thingum-a-jig.
  Needles for hornets, nippers for ants,
  For the bumblebee baby a new pair of pants,
  For the grizzled old gopher a hat and a wig,
  The beetle ground out of his thingum-a-jig.

  THE THIEVES


  Tibbitts and Bibbitts and Solomon Sly
  Ran off one day with a cucumber pie.
  Tibbitts was tossed by a Kensington cow,
  Bibbitts was hanged on a brambleweed bough,
  And poor little Solomon--what do you think?
  Was drowned one dark night in a bottle of ink.




  UPON THE IRISH SEA


  Some one told Maria Ann,
  Maria Ann told me,
  That kittens ride in coffee cans
  Upon the Irish Sea.

  From quiet caves to rolling waves,
  How jolly it must be
  To travel in a coffee can
  Upon the Irish Sea!

  But when it snows and when it blows,
  How would you like to be
  A kitten in a coffee can
  Upon the Irish Sea?




  DUCKLE, DAISY

  Duckle, duckle, daisy.

  I'VE GOT A NEW BOOK


  I've got a new book from my Grandfather Hyde.
  It's skin on the cover and paper inside,
  And reads about Arabs and horses and slaves,
  And tells how the Caliph of Bagdad behaves.
  I'd not take a goat and a dollar beside
  For the book that I got from my Grandfather Hyde.




  THE CARROT AND THE RABBIT


  A carrot in a garden
  And a rabbit in the wood.
  Said the rabbit, "Beg your pardon,

  Though you've started in to harden,
  You may still be very good."




  HIPPY-HI-HOPPY


  Hippy-Hi-Hoppy, the big fat toad,
  Greeted his friends at a turn of the road.

  Said he to the snail:
  "Here's a ring for your tail
  If you'll go into town for my afternoon mail."

  Said he to the rat:
  "I have talked with the cat;
  And she'll nab you so quick you won't know where you're at."

  Said he to the lizard:
  "I'm really no wizard,
  But I'll show you a trick that will tickle your gizzard."

  Said he to the lark:
  "When it gets fairly dark
  We'll chase the mosquitoes in Peek-a-Boo Park."

  Said he to the owl:
  "If it were not for your scowl
  I'd like you as well as most any wild fowl."

  Said he to the wren:
  "You're tiny, but then
  I'll marry you quick, if you'll only say when."

  When the circus band goes by.

  A MOON SONG


  Who hung his hat on the moon?
  The owl in his bubble balloon.
  One bright summer night

  His three-cornered hat on the moon.




  WHAT MAKES YOU LAUGH?


  "What makes you laugh, my little lass,
  From morning until noon?"
  "I saw a dappled donkey

  "What makes you cry, my little lass,
  And get your eyes so red?"
  "I saw a cruel gardener cut
  A poor old cabbage head."

  Began to tickle with her tail.
  This the monster could not stand,
  And spewed her out upon dry land.
  That night, when all was fine as silk
  And she had supped her bread and milk,
  She grinned and told old Batteroff
  How she got the whale to cough.

  DOUBBLEDOON


  Bobbin rode a rocking-horse
  'Way down to Doubbledoon,
  He told his little sister
  He'd be back that afternoon.
  But maybe after all she didn't
  Understand him right,
  For he wasn't back again
  Till the middle of the night.

  And what did little Bobbin see
  'Way down at Doubbledoon?
  He saw a crazy Arab
  Throwing bubbles at the moon,
  A monkey making faces
  And a rabbit in a rage,
  A parrot shouting "Murder!"
  From the ceiling of his cage.

  At last a yellow jumping-jack,
  A camel, and a coon,
  Chased poor little Bobbin
  All the way from Doubbledoon.

  THE PARTY


  Billy Bluebird had a party
  In an elder tree,
  But the little black-eyed smarty
  Didn't ask us to his party
  Neither you nor me.

  This is what they had for dinner,
  For I peeked to see:
  Apple seeds and beetle finner,
  And for drink the little sinner
  Gave them tansy tea.

  But there came an awful clatter
  From that elder tree,
  When he served them on a platter
  Hopper-hash and brick-dust batter
  Trimmed with celery!

  All the folks were hale and hearty,
  Happy as could be;
  And that little black-eyed smarty
  Left out of his funny party
  Only you and me.

  COLUMBUS


  Columbus sailed over the ocean blue
  To find the United States.
  In three small ships he carried his crew,

  He found a land in the western seas,
  And Indians galore,
  With jabbering parrots in the trees,
  And sharks along the shore.

  [Illustration]

  He filled his pockets with sparkling stones
  And took to the mighty main,
  With a couple of slaves, some nuts and cones
  For the glorious king of Spain.

  Now this is the tale Columbus told,
  And most of the tale is true,
  How he crossed the seas, a sailor bold,
  In fourteen-ninety-two.

  With one terrible crunch.
  He could mix a whole city
  All up in a mess,
  He could drink up a sea
  Or an ocean, I guess.
  You'd better be watching for Terrible Tim,
  And run when you first get your peepers on him.

  If you float on a log?"

  "Why should I,"
  Said the fly,
  "Suck an old apple-core,
  When there's sugar and fruit
  In the grocery store?"

  "It's but right,"
  Said the kite,
  "That I follow the wind.
  What's a fellow to do
  If he hasn't a mind?"

  "You'll allow,"
  Said the cow,
  "That I'm really no thief,
  When I turn all the clover
  I steal, into beef."

  "Come again,"
  Said the hen,
  "On some other fine day.
  Don't think 'cause I cackle
  I always must lay."

  And never drinks even a sup,

  "Now, listen," said their mother, "don't you climb up any higher.

  But the naughty little snowflakes didn't mind a word she said,
  Each tried to clamber faster than his fellow just ahead;
  They thought that they'd be back in time enough to go to bed.
  But they found out that their mother wasn't quite the dunce they
        thought her,
  The sun bobbed up--remember this, my little son and daughter--

  HIPPERTY, CLICKERTY, CLACKERTY, BANG


  Hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,
  Get in a corner as fast as you can!
  The sideboard is tipsy, the table is mad,
  The chairs have lost all the sense that they had.
  So hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,
  Get in a corner as fast as you can!

  SONNY


  A sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  And sent him out to buy a ton of coal;
  But he met a poor old miser
  Who told him it were wiser
  To bury all his money in a hole.

  A sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  And told him he should buy a suit of clothes;
  But he saw a pretty maiden
  With all kinds of posies laden,
  And he gave her all his money for a rose.

  Then the sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  To buy a little garden and a house;
  But he found him the next day,
  In a shop on Yesler Way,
  A-buying cheese and crackers for a mouse.

  THE STOVE


  A stove is a thing that gets awfully hot,
  And fries up your meat, or whatever you've got.
  It's made out of iron and hinges and screws,
  And filled up with shakers, and dampers, and flues.
  It's not very long and it's not very wide;
  It's got black'ning on top and ashes inside.

  THE THUNDER BABY


  Have you heard of the Thunder Baby
  Way up in the big blue sky?
  You've seen his cradle, maybe,
  And maybe you've heard him cry.

  Most of the time he's sleeping,
  Rolled up in a big white cloud,
  But when he's awake and hungry
  He bellows awfully loud.

  And when he's crying, sometimes
  You can hear his teardrops fall
  With a patter, patter, patter,
  Against the garden wall.

  But when he's madder'n mischief,
  He rolls, and growls, and spits,
  And kicks the clouds all forty ways,
  And gives the weather fits.

  Then tears come down in bucketfuls,
  And children dance for joy,
  Till the sun comes out and soundly spanks
  Her Thunder Baby Boy.

  JOLLY JINKS


  Jolly Jinks, the sailor man,
  Went to sea in an oyster can.
  But he found the water wet,
  Fishes got into his net,
  So he pulled his boat to shore
  And vowed he'd sail the seas no more.




  TRANSFORMATION


  Auntie Ellen found her poodle--
  Mercy! Goodness sake!--
  Playing with the mully-wumps
  Down along the lake.

  And when she called him tenderly
  He didn't want to come;
  It took her over half an hour
  To get the rascal home.

  She washed him well with shaving-soap,
  Pumice stone and lye,
  She showered him and she scoured him
  And she hung him up to dry.

  And now he sits there quite serene,
  The sweetest poodle ever seen.

  THE THIEF CHASE


  Bricks and bones!
  Sticks and stones!
  I chased a thief through twenty zones.

  I found his hat
  On Ararat,
  And hurried on as quick as scat.

  In a day or two
  I found his shoe
  Where he had sailed for Timbuktu.

  I met the goat
  That ate his coat
  Upon the road to Terre Haute.

  At last all worn
  And quite forlorn
  I chased him up the Matterhorn.




  SOMEBODY


  Somebody give me a peanut,
  Somebody give me a pear;
  I want to go down to the circus

  CONSOLATION


  A dime and a dollar
  Took me by the collar
  And whispered this word in my ear:

  "We must leave you to-morrow,
  But prithee don't sorrow,
  We'll come back to see you next year."




  THE ROBIN AND THE SQUIRREL

  Said the Squirrel to the Robin,

  RAIN


  The lightning split the sky in two
  And set the clouds to leaking
  Just as dear old Pastor Brown
  Began his Sunday speaking.

  He told about the awful rain
  That fell in Noah's day,
  And one by one the happy smiles
  Began to fade away.

  In half an hour the people all
  Put on their rubber coats,
  And when he finished everyone
  Was out and building boats.

  King Kokem lay snoozing upon his brass bed--
  Oh, play an old tune on your fiddle!
  With shoes on his feet, and a crown on his head--
  Oh, tune up your rusty old fiddle!

  He dreamed of a land where the lions were tame,
  Where they fried their lamb-chops on a griddle,
  Where they called all the parrots and monkeys by name--
  Oh, play us a tune on your fiddle!

  He dreamed of a sea filled with raspberry pop,
  With a cocoanut isle in the middle,
  Where the stones and the boulders had icing on top--
  Go strike up a tune on your fiddle!

  He dreamed of a sky where the moonbeams all danced
  While a comet was telling a riddle,
  Where the stars and the planets and sun-dogs all pranced
  While the moon played his fiddle de diddle.

  The pig's in the pantry,

  Oh, what shall I do?
  A rat has run off
  With my very best shoe.




  CELLA REE AND TOMMY TO


  Two funny friends that you all know
  Are Cella Ree and Tommy To.
  About as queer as friends can be,
  Are Tommy To and Cella Ree.
  For hours they sit there grim and stable
  Side by side upon the table.
  Tom is red and Cella pale,
  His blushes are of no avail;
  She sits, in spite of his endeavor,
  As firm and undisturbed as ever,
  A funny pair, you must agree,
  This Tommy To and Cella Ree.

  A wonderful drink--
  Peppermint, ice,
  Lemons and spice--
  Taste pretty nice,

  THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN


  O the Army of the Queen,

  Their guns are filled with powder
  And their swords are bright and keen;
  So toot your little trumpet
  For the Army of the Queen.

  THE HERO


  My dad was a soldier and fought in the wars,
  My grandfather fought on the sea,
  And the tales of their daring and valor of course
  Put the sand and the ginger in me.

  I'm not scared of tigers or any wild beast,
  I could fight with a lion all right,
  I wouldn't be 'fraid of a bear in the least--
  Excepting, perhaps, in the night.

  But sister, she's skeery as skeery can be,
  She's even afraid of the bark of a tree.




  PENSIVE PERCY


  Percy when a little boy
  Was quiet as a mouse,
  He never set the barn afire
  Nor battered down the house.

  He used to sit for hours and hours
  Just gazing at the moon,
  And feeding little fishes
  Sarsaparilla from a spoon.

  Moon, O Moon in the empty sky,
  Why do you swing so low?
  Pretty moon with the silver ring
  And the long bright beams where the fairies cling,
  Where do you always go?

  I go to the land of the Siamese,
  Ceylon and the Great Plateau,
  Over the seas where Sinbad sailed,
  Where Moses crossed and Pharaoh failed,--
  There's where I always go.

  "Oh--it's full of rimes and riddles,
  Jingles, jokes, and hi-de-diddles--
  This bundle that I carry on my back."

  "O tell us, funny rag-man,
  Grinny, skinny rag-man,
  Where did you pick up your funny rimes?"

  "Some were dancing with corn-flowers,
  Some were hiding in church-towers,
  And sprinkled helter-skelter by the chimes."

  "Rag-man, rag-man,
  Nice old taggy rag-man,
  Sing us just one jingle, tingle song."

  "Why, my dears, I've got a plenty,
  Sing you one? I'll sing you twenty--
  I've been hoping you would ask me all along."

  Like an orphan angel through the endless sky.

  Jelly Jake and Butter Bill
  One dark night when all was still
  Pattered down the long, dark stair,
  And no one saw the guilty pair;
  Pushed aside the pantry-door
  And there found everything galore,--
  Honey, raisins, orange-peel,
  Cold chicken aplenty for a meal,
  Gingerbread enough to fill
  Two such boys as Jake and Bill.
  Well, they ate and ate and ate,
  Gobbled at an awful rate
  Till I'm sure they soon weighed more
  Than double what they did before.
  And then, it's awful, still it's true,
  The floor gave way and they went thru.
  Filled so full they couldn't fight.
  Slowly they sank out of sight.
  Father, Mother, Cousin Ann,
  Cook and nurse and furnace man
  Fished in forty-dozen ways
  After them, for twenty days;
  But not a soul has chanced to get
  A glimpse or glimmer of them yet.
  And I'm afraid we never will--
  Poor Jelly Jake and Butter Bill.

  A BIG, FAT POTATO


  A big, fat potato lay down on a clod
  In the shade of some burdock and tall goldenrod,
  And he dreamed he were king of the whole garden plot,
  With a palace and throne, and a crown with a lot
  Of jewels and diamonds and gold till it shone
  Like the front of a show when the lights are turned on.
  He had to be minded by all of the plants;
  When he whistled the radishes knew they must dance;
  When he tooted his horn the cucumbers must sing
  To a vegetable crowd gathered round in a ring.
  He made all the cabbages stand in a row
  While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow;
  The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue;
  Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new.
  He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand
  To be king and commander o'er all the wide land.
  But at last he woke up with an awful surprise
  And found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.

  A princely Indian corn-stalk with rings in both his ears.

  About a hundred times a day,

  In a fairy looking-glass.

  Come to the sea where the babies sail
  In ships of shining pearl,
  Borne to the west by a golden gale
  Of sun-beams all awhirl;
  And perhaps a baby brother will sail
  To you, my little girl.

  With lots of whiskers on his chin,

  And one was round and sleek and fat
  (He must have been a butcher's cat).

  One was dapper, slight, and frail,
  With bells and tassels on his tail,

  And one had starey yellow eyes
  Almost as big as pumpkin pies.

  These four came marching down the street
  As I came out of Grundy Greet.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
