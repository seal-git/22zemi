“BLESSED IS THE SPOT, AND THE HOUSE...”


Blessed is the spot, and the house,
and the place, and the city,
and the heart, and the mountain,
and the refuge, and the cave,
and the valley, and the land,
and the sea, and the island,
and the meadow where mention
of God hath been made,
and His praise glorified.

—Bahá’u’lláh




“INTONE, O MY SERVANT, THE VERSES OF GOD...”


Intone, O My servant, the verses of God that have been received by thee,
as intoned by them who have drawn nigh unto Him,
that the sweetness of thy melody may kindle thine own soul,
and attract the hearts of all men. Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his
chamber,
the verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty
shall scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth,
and shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb.
Though he may, at first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtue
of the grace vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise
its influence upon his soul. Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation
of God been decreed by virtue of the Will of Him
Who is the Source of power and wisdom.

—BAHÁ’U’LLÁH





OBLIGATORY PRAYERS




“The daily obligatory prayers are three in number....”


“The daily obligatory prayers are three in number. ... The believer is
entirely free to choose any one of these three prayers, but is under the
obligation of reciting one of them, and in accordance with any specific
directions with which they may be accompanied.”

—from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

“By ‘morning,’ ‘noon’ and ‘evening,’ mentioned in connection with the
Obligatory Prayers, is meant respectively the intervals between sunrise
and noon, between noon and sunset, and from sunset till two hours after
sunset.”—Synopsis and Codification of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 36




SHORT OBLIGATORY PRAYER


            _TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, AT NOON_

I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to
worship Thee.

I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my
poverty and to Thy wealth.

There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.




MEDIUM OBLIGATORY PRAYER


    _TO BE RECITED DAILY, IN THE MORNING, AT NOON, AND IN THE EVENING_

Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and while he washeth, let
him say:

Strengthen my hand, O my God, that it may take hold of Thy Book with such
steadfastness that the hosts of the world shall have no power over it.
Guard it, then, from meddling with whatsoever doth not belong unto it.
Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

And while washing his face, let him say:

I have turned my face unto Thee, O my Lord! Illumine it with the light of
Thy countenance. Protect it, then, from turning to anyone but Thee.

Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e.
Bahjí, Akká), let him say:

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the kingdoms
of Revelation and of creation. He, in truth, hath manifested Him Who is
the Dayspring of Revelation, Who conversed on Sinai, through Whom the
Supreme Horizon hath been made to shine, and the Lote-Tree beyond which
there is no passing hath spoken, and through Whom the call hath been
proclaimed unto all who are in heaven and on earth: “Lo, the
All-Possessing is come. Earth and heaven, glory and dominion are God’s,
the Lord of all men, and the Possessor of the Throne on high and of earth
below!”

Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say:

Exalted art Thou above my praise and the praise of anyone beside me, above
my description and the description of all who are in heaven and all who
are on earth!

Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward the face, let him say:

Disappoint not, O my God, him that hath, with beseeching fingers, clung to
the hem of Thy mercy and Thy grace, O Thou Who of those who show mercy art
the Most Merciful!

Let him, then, be seated and say:

I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and
that there is none other God beside Thee. Thou hast, verily, revealed Thy
Cause, fulfilled Thy Covenant, and opened wide the door of Thy grace to
all that dwell in heaven and on earth. Blessing and peace, salutation and
glory, rest upon Thy loved ones, whom the changes and chances of the world
have not deterred from turning unto Thee, and who have given their all, in
the hope of obtaining that which is with Thee. Thou art, in truth, the
Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

(If anyone choose to recite instead of the long verse these words: “God
testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting,” it would be sufficient. And likewise, it would suffice
were he, while seated, to choose to recite these words: “I bear witness to
Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and that there is none
other God beside Thee.”)

—Bahá’u’lláh




LONG OBLIGATORY PRAYER


                _TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS_

Whoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and turn unto God,
and, as he standeth in his place, let him gaze to the right and to the
left, as if awaiting the mercy of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the
Compassionate. Then let him say:

O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Maker of the heavens! I
beseech Thee by them Who are the Daysprings of Thine invisible Essence,
the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to make of my prayer a fire that will
burn away the veils which have shut me out from Thy beauty, and a light
that will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.

Let him then raise his hands in supplication toward God—blessed and
exalted be He—and say:

O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved of the nations! Thou seest
me turning toward Thee, and rid of all attachment to anyone save Thee, and
clinging to Thy cord, through whose movement the whole creation hath been
stirred up. I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the son of Thy servant.
Behold me standing ready to do Thy will and Thy desire, and wishing naught
else except Thy good pleasure. I implore Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy
and the Daystar of Thy grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and
pleasest. By Thy might which is far above all mention and praise!
Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved
of my soul. O God, my God! Look not upon my hopes and my doings, nay
rather look upon Thy will that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth.
By Thy Most Great Name, O Thou Lord of all nations! I have desired only
what Thou didst desire, and love only what Thou dost love.

Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:

Exalted art Thou above the description of anyone save Thyself, and the
comprehension of aught else except Thee.

Let him then stand and say:

Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living waters whereby I may live
as long as Thy sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of Thee in every
world of Thy worlds.

Let him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:

O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have melted, and by the
fire of Whose love the whole world hath been set aflame! I implore Thee by
Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole creation, not to
withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who rulest over all men!
Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to his most exalted home
beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within the precincts of Thy mercy;
and this transgressor seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly
one the court of Thy glory; and this poor creature the orient of Thy
wealth. Thine is the authority to command whatsoever Thou willest. I bear
witness that Thou art to be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy
behests, and to remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.

Let him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name.(1)
Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God—blessed
and exalted be He—and say:

Thou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath been stirred up within my limbs
and members, in its longing to worship Thee, and in its yearning to
remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth to that whereunto the
Tongue of Thy Commandment hath testified in the kingdom of Thine utterance
and the heaven of Thy knowledge. I love, in this state, O my Lord, to beg
of Thee all that is with Thee, that I may demonstrate my poverty, and
magnify Thy bounty and Thy riches, and may declare my powerlessness, and
manifest Thy power and Thy might.

Let him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:

There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. There is no God
but Thee, the Ordainer, both in the beginning and in the end. O God, my
God! Thy forgiveness hath emboldened me, and Thy mercy hath strengthened
me, and Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace hath raised me up and led
me unto Thee. Who, otherwise, am I that I should dare to stand at the gate
of the city of Thy nearness, or set my face toward the lights that are
shining from the heaven of Thy will? Thou seest, O my Lord, this wretched
creature knocking at the door of Thy grace, and this evanescent soul
seeking the river of everlasting life from the hands of Thy bounty. Thine
is the command at all times, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names; and
mine is resignation and willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the
heavens!

Let him then raise his hands thrice, and say:

Greater is God than every great one!

Let him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground, say:

Too high art Thou for the praise of those who are nigh unto Thee to ascend
unto the heaven of Thy nearness, or for the birds of the hearts of them
who are devoted to Thee to attain to the door of Thy gate. I testify that
Thou hast been sanctified above all attributes and holy above all names.
No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.

Let him then seat himself and say:

I testify unto that whereunto have testified all created things, and the
Concourse on high, and the inmates of the all-highest Paradise, and beyond
them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from the all-glorious Horizon, that
Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, and that He Who hath been
manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the
letters B and E (Be) have been joined and knit together. I testify that it
is He Whose name hath been set down by the Pen of the Most High, and Who
hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne on high
and of earth below.

Let him then stand erect and say:

O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and invisible!
Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter, and hearest my
groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart. By Thy might!
My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto Thee; and my sins
have held me far from the court of Thy holiness. Thy love, O my Lord, hath
enriched me, and separation from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness
from Thee hath consumed me. I entreat Thee by Thy footsteps in this
wilderness, and by the words “Here am I. Here am I” which Thy chosen Ones
have uttered in this immensity, and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and
the gentle winds of the Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may
gaze on Thy beauty and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book.

Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands
resting on the knees, and say:

Praise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast aided me to remember Thee and
to praise Thee, and hast made known unto me Him Who is the Dayspring of
Thy signs, and hast caused me to bow down before Thy Lordship, and humble
myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge that which hath been uttered
by the Tongue of Thy grandeur.

Let him then rise and say:

O God, my God! My back is bowed by the burden of my sins, and my
heedlessness hath destroyed me. Whenever I ponder my evil doings and Thy
benevolence, my heart melteth within me, and my blood boileth in my veins.
By Thy Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world! I blush to life up my face
to Thee, and my longing hands are ashamed to stretch forth toward the
heaven of Thy bounty. Thou seest, O my God, how my tears prevent me from
remembering Thee and from extolling Thy virtues, O Thou the Lord of the
Throne on high and of earth below! I implore Thee by the signs of Thy
Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to do with Thy loved ones as
becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of all being, and is worthy of Thy grace, O
King of the seen and the unseen!

Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead
to the ground, and say:

Praise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou hast sent down unto us that
which draweth us nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good thing
sent down by Thee in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures. Protect us, we beseech
Thee, O my Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginations.
Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

Let him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:

I testify, O my God, to that whereunto Thy chosen Ones have testified, and
acknowledge that which the inmates of the all-highest Paradise and those
who have circled round Thy mighty Throne have acknowledged. The kingdoms
of earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of the worlds!

GENERAL PRAYERS




AID AND ASSISTANCE



“O Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration,...”


O Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration, Whose beauty is my
sanctuary, Whose habitation is my goal, Whose praise is my hope, Whose
providence is my companion, Whose love is the cause of my being, Whose
mention is my solace, Whose nearness is my desire, Whose presence is my
dearest wish and highest aspiration, I entreat Thee not to withhold from
me the things Thou didst ordain for the chosen ones among Thy servants.
Supply me, then, with the good of this world and of the next.

Thou, truly, art the King of all men. There is no God but Thee, the
Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“My God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire!...”


My God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire! What tongue can voice my thanks
to Thee? I was heedless, Thou didst awaken me. I had turned back from
Thee, Thou didst graciously aid me to turn towards Thee. I was as one
dead, Thou didst quicken me with the water of life. I was withered, Thou
didst revive me with the heavenly stream of Thine utterance which hath
flowed forth from the Pen of the All-Merciful.

O Divine Providence! All existence is begotten by Thy bounty; deprive it
not of the waters of Thy generosity, neither do Thou withhold it from the
ocean of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to aid and assist me at all times and
under all conditions, and seek from the heaven of Thy grace Thine ancient
favor. Thou art, in truth, the Lord of bounty, and the Sovereign of the
kingdom of eternity.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God! Thou...”


Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God! Thou art in truth the Knower of things
unseen. Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing knowledge can
measure. Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.

All praise be unto Thee, O Lord! We shall seek Thy grace on the appointed
Day and shall put our whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord. Glorified
art Thou, O God! Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may be
able to dispense with everything but Thee. Verily, Thou art the Lord of
all worlds.

O God! Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy days, and strengthen
their hearts to walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth. Grant then, O
Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable them to gain admittance into Thy
blissful Paradise. Exalted art Thou, O Lord God. Let Thy heavenly
blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed in Thee. Verily,
unsurpassed art Thou in sending down divine blessings. Send forth, O God,
such hosts as would render Thy faithful servants victorious. Thou dost
fashion the created things through the power of Thy decree as Thou
pleasest. Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the Creator, the All-Wise.

Say: God is indeed the Maker of all things. He giveth sustenance in plenty
to whomsoever He willeth. He is the Creator, the Source of all beings, the
Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise. He is the Bearer of the
most excellent titles throughout the heavens and the earth and whatever
lieth between them. All do His bidding, and all the dwellers of earth and
heaven celebrate His praise, and unto Him shall all return.

“O my God, my Lord and my Master! I have...”


O my God, my Lord and my Master! I have detached myself from my kindred
and have sought through Thee to become independent of all that dwell on
earth and ever ready to receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight.
Bestow on me such good as will make me independent of aught else but Thee,
and grant me an ampler share of Thy boundless favors. Verily, Thou art the
Lord of grace abounding.

—The Báb



“Lord! Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor,...”


Lord! Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor, bestow upon us a share
from the ocean of Thy wealth; needy, do Thou satisfy us; abased, give us
Thy glory. The fowls of the air and the beasts of the field receive their
meat each day from Thee, and all beings partake of Thy care and
loving-kindness.

Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous grace and vouchsafe by Thy
might unto this helpless soul Thy bounty.

Give us our daily bread, and grant Thine increase in the necessities of
life, that we may be dependent on none other but Thee, may commune wholly
with Thee, may walk in Thy ways and declare Thy mysteries. Thou art the
Almighty and the Loving and the Provider of all mankind.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou kind Lord! We are servants of Thy...”


O Thou kind Lord! We are servants of Thy Threshold, taking shelter at Thy
holy Door. We seek no refuge save only this strong pillar, turn nowhere
for a haven but unto Thy safekeeping. Protect us, bless us, support us,
make us such that we shall love but Thy good pleasure, utter only Thy
praise, follow only the pathway of truth, that we may become rich enough
to dispense with all save Thee, and receive our gifts from the sea of Thy
beneficence, that we may ever strive to exalt Thy Cause and to spread Thy
sweet savors far and wide, that we may become oblivious of self and
occupied only with Thee, and disown all else and be caught up in Thee.

O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver! Grant us Thy grace and loving-kindness,
Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, and sustain us, that we may attain our goal.
Thou art the Powerful, the Able, the Knower, the Seer; and, verily, Thou
art the Generous, and, verily, Thou art the All-Merciful, and, verily,
Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, He to Whom repentance is due, He Who
forgiveth even the most grievous of sins.

“Remove not, O Lord, the festal board that hath...”


Remove not, O Lord, the festal board that hath been spread in Thy Name,
and extinguish not the burning flame that hath been kindled by Thine
unquenchable fire. Withhold not from flowing that living water of Thine
that murmureth with the melody of Thy glory and Thy remembrance, and
deprive not Thy servants from the fragrance of Thy sweet savors breathing
forth the perfume of Thy love.

Lord! Turn the distressing cares of Thy holy ones into ease, their
hardship into comfort, their abasement into glory, their sorrow into
blissful joy, O Thou that holdest in Thy grasp the reins of all mankind!

Thou art, verily, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise.

PRAYER FOR AMERICA



“O Thou kind Lord! This gathering is turning...”


O Thou kind Lord! This gathering is turning to Thee. These hearts are
radiant with Thy love. These minds and spirits are exhilarated by the
message of Thy glad-tidings. O God! Let this American democracy become
glorious in spiritual degrees even as it has aspired to material degrees,
and render this just government victorious. Confirm this revered nation to
upraise the standard of the oneness of humanity, to promulgate the Most
Great Peace, to become thereby most glorious and praiseworthy among all
the nations of the world. O God! This American nation is worthy of Thy
favors and is deserving of Thy mercy. Make it precious and near to Thee
through Thy bounty and bestowal.

ASSISTANCE WITH TESTS



“Dispel my grief by Thy bounty and Thy generosity,...”


Dispel my grief by Thy bounty and Thy generosity, O God, my God, and
banish mine anguish through Thy sovereignty and Thy might. Thou seest me,
O my God, with my face set towards Thee at a time when sorrows have
compassed me on every side. I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all
being, and overshadowest all things visible and invisible, by Thy Name
whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts and the souls of men, and by the
billows of the Ocean of Thy mercy and the splendors of the Daystar of Thy
bounty, to number me with them whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from
setting their faces toward Thee, O Thou Lord of all names and Maker of the
heavens!

Thou beholdest, O my Lord, the things which have befallen me in Thy days.
I entreat Thee, by Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy names and the
Dawning-Place of Thine attributes, to ordain for me what will enable me to
arise to serve Thee and to extol Thy virtues. Thou art, verily, the
Almighty, the Most Powerful, Who art wont to answer the prayers of all
men!

And, finally, I beg of Thee by the light of Thy countenance to bless my
affairs, and redeem my debts, and satisfy my needs. Thou art He to Whose
power and to Whose dominion every tongue hath testified, and Whose majesty
and Whose sovereignty every understanding heart hath acknowledged. No God
is there but Thee, Who hearest and art ready to answer.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God! I entreat...”


Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God! I entreat Thee by the sighing of
Thy lovers and by the tears shed by them that long to behold Thee, not to
withhold from me Thy tender mercies in Thy Day, nor to deprive me of the
melodies of the Dove that extolleth Thy oneness before the light that
shineth from Thy face. I am the one who is in misery, O God! Behold me
cleaving fast to Thy Name, the All-Possessing. I am the one who is sure to
perish; behold me clinging to Thy Name, the Imperishable. I implore Thee,
therefore, by Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most High, not to abandon me unto
mine own self and unto the desires of a corrupt inclination. Hold Thou my
hand with the hand of Thy power, and deliver me from the depths of my
fancies and idle imaginings, and cleanse me of all that is abhorrent unto
Thee.

Cause me, then, to turn wholly unto Thee, to put my whole trust in Thee,
to seek Thee as my Refuge, and to flee unto Thy face. Thou art, verily, He
Who, through the power of His might, doeth whatsoever He desireth, and
commandeth, through the potency of His will, whatsoever He chooseth. None
can withstand the operation of Thy decree; none can divert the course of
Thine appointment. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the
Most Bountiful.

“O Lord, my God and my Haven in my distress!...”


O Lord, my God and my Haven in my distress! My Shield and my Shelter in my
woes! My Asylum and Refuge in time of need and in my loneliness my
Companion! In my anguish my Solace, and in my solitude a loving Friend!
The Remover of the pangs of my sorrows and the Pardoner of my sins!

Wholly unto Thee do I turn, fervently imploring Thee with all my heart, my
mind and my tongue, to shield me from all that runs counter to Thy will in
this, the cycle of Thy divine unity, and to cleanse me of all defilement
that will hinder me from seeking, stainless and unsullied, the shade of
the tree of Thy grace.

Have mercy, O Lord, on the feeble, make whole the sick, and quench the
burning thirst.

Gladden the bosom wherein the fire of Thy love doth smolder, and set it
aglow with the flame of Thy celestial love and spirit.

Robe the tabernacles of divine unity with the vesture of holiness, and set
upon my head the crown of Thy favor.

Illumine my face with the radiance of the orb of Thy bounty, and
graciously aid me in ministering at Thy holy threshold.

Make my heart overflow with love for Thy creatures and grant that I may
become the sign of Thy mercy, the token of Thy grace, the promoter of
concord amongst Thy loved ones, devoted unto Thee, uttering Thy
commemoration and forgetful of self but ever mindful of what is Thine.

O God, my God! Stay not from me the gentle gales of Thy pardon and grace,
and deprive me not of the wellsprings of Thine aid and favor.

‘Neath the shade of Thy protecting wings let me nestle, and cast upon me
the glance of Thine all-protecting eye.

Loose my tongue to laud Thy name amidst Thy people, that my voice may be
raised in great assemblies and from my lips may stream the flood of Thy
praise.

Omnipotent.

any will I seek save Thee; no path have I trodden nor any will I tread but
the path of Thy love. In the darksome night of despair, my eye turneth
expectant and full of hope to the morn of Thy boundless favor and at the
hour of dawn my drooping soul is refreshed and strengthened in remembrance
of Thy beauty and perfection. He whom the grace of Thy mercy aideth,
though he be but a drop, shall become the boundless ocean, and the merest
atom which the outpouring of Thy loving-kindness assisteth, shall shine
even as the radiant star.

Shelter under Thy protection, O Thou Spirit of purity, Thou Who art the
All-Bountiful Provider, this enthralled, enkindled servant of Thine. Aid
him in this world of being to remain steadfast and firm in Thy love and
grant that this broken-winged bird attain a refuge and shelter in Thy

those who are severed from all else save Thee, who long to serve Thy

Lauded art Thou, O my Best Beloved, waft over him the sweet savors of Thy
transcendent bounty and the fragrances of Thy holy bestowals. Enable him
then to seek shelter beneath the shadow of Thy most exalted Name, O Thou

guidance and develop me under the shadow of Thy bounty. Deliver me from
darkness, make me a brilliant light; free me from unhappiness, make me a
flower of the rose garden; suffer me to become a servant of Thy threshold
and confer upon me the disposition and nature of the righteous; make me a
cause of bounty to the human world, and crown my head with the diadem of
eternal life.

Nurture this plant then through the outpourings of the clouds of Thy
tender mercy and quicken and refresh this sapling through the reviving
breath of Thy spiritual springtime. Suffer him to become heedful,
discerning and noble, and grant that he may attain eternal life and abide

Cause, may guide the wayward, lead the hapless, free the captives and
awaken the heedless, that all may be blessed with Thy remembrance and
praise. Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful.

FOR THE DEPARTED



“O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of...”


(The Prayer for the Dead is to be used for Bahá’ís over the age of
fifteen. “It is the only Bahá’í obligatory prayer which is to be recited
in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present
stand. There is no requirement to face the Qiblih when reciting this
prayer.”—A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas)

O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant who hath believed
in Thee and in Thy signs, and set his face towards Thee, wholly detached
from all except Thee. Thou art, verily, of those who show mercy the most
merciful.

Deal with him, O Thou Who forgivest the sins of men and concealest their
faults, as beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy grace.
Grant him admission within the precincts of Thy transcendent mercy that
was before the foundation of earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee,
the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.

Let him, then, repeat six times the greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá,” and then
repeat nineteen times each of the following verses:

We all, verily, worship God.

We all, verily, bow down before God.

We all, verily, are devoted unto God.

We all, verily, give praise unto God.

We all, verily, yield thanks unto God.

We all, verily, are patient in God.

(If the dead be a woman, let him say: This is Thy handmaiden and the
daughter of Thy handmaiden, etc. ...)

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! Abase not...”


Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! Abase not him whom Thou hast exalted
through the power of Thine everlasting sovereignty, and remove not far
from Thee him whom Thou hast caused to enter the tabernacle of Thine
eternity. Wilt Thou cast away, O my God, him whom Thou hast overshadowed
with Thy Lordship, and wilt Thou turn away from Thee, O my Desire, him to
whom Thou hast been a refuge? Canst Thou degrade him whom Thou hast
uplifted, or forget him whom Thou didst enable to remember Thee?

Glorified, immensely glorified art Thou! Thou art He Who from everlasting
hath been the King of the entire creation and its Prime Mover, and Thou
wilt to everlasting remain the Lord of all created things and their
Ordainer. Glorified art Thou, O my God! If Thou ceasest to be merciful
unto Thy servants, who, then, will show mercy unto them; and if Thou
refusest to succor Thy loved ones, who is there that can succor them?

Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou! Thou art adored in Thy truth,
and Thee do we all, verily, worship; and Thou art manifest in Thy justice,
and to Thee do we all, verily, bear witness. Thou art, in truth, beloved
in Thy grace. No God is there but Thee, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of loving-kindness...”


He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of loving-kindness and bounty!

Glory be unto Thee, Thou, O my God, the Lord Omnipotent. I testify to
Thine omnipotence and Thy might, Thy sovereignty and Thy loving-kindness,
Thy grace and Thy power, the oneness of Thy Being and the unity of Thine
Essence, Thy sanctity and exaltation above the world of being and all that
is therein.

O my God! Thou seest me detached from all save Thee, holding fast unto
Thee and turning unto the ocean of Thy bounty, to the heaven of Thy favor,
to the Daystar of Thy grace.

Lord! I bear witness that in Thy servant Thou hast reposed Thy Trust, and
that is the Spirit wherewith Thou hast given life to the world.

I ask of Thee by the splendor of the Orb of Thy Revelation, mercifully to
accept from him that which he hath achieved in Thy days. Grant then that
he may be invested with the glory of Thy good-pleasure and adorned with
Thine acceptance.

O my Lord! I myself and all created things bear witness unto Thy might,
and I pray Thee not to turn away from Thyself this spirit that hath
ascended unto Thee, unto Thy heavenly place, Thine exalted Paradise and
Thy retreats of nearness, O Thou who art the Lord of all men!

Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant may consort with Thy chosen ones,
Thy saints and Thy Messengers in heavenly places that the pen cannot tell
nor the tongue recount.

O my Lord, the poor one hath verily hastened unto the Kingdom of Thy
wealth, the stranger unto his home within Thy precincts, he that is sore
athirst to the heavenly river of Thy bounty. Deprive him not, O Lord, from
his share of the banquet of Thy grace and from the favor of Thy bounty.
Thou art in truth the Almighty, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful.

O my God, Thy Trust hath been returned unto Thee. It behooveth Thy grace
and Thy bounty that have compassed Thy dominions on earth and in heaven,
to vouchsafe unto Thy newly welcomed one Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, and
the fruits of the tree of Thy grace! Powerful art Thou to do as Thou
willest, there is none other God but Thee, the Gracious, the Most
Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Pardoner, the Precious,
the All-Knowing.

I testify, O my Lord, that Thou hast enjoined upon men to honor their
guest, and he that hath ascended unto Thee hath verily reached Thee and
attained Thy Presence. Deal with him then according to Thy grace and
bounty! By Thy glory, I know of a certainty that Thou wilt not withhold
Thyself from that which Thou hast commanded Thy servants, nor wilt Thou
deprive him that hath clung to the cord of Thy bounty and hath ascended to
the Dayspring of Thy wealth.

There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the
Omniscient, the Bountiful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower...”


O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower of gifts, dispeller of
afflictions!

Verily, I beseech Thee to forgive the sins of such as have abandoned the
physical garment and have ascended to the spiritual world.

O my Lord! Purify them from trespasses, dispel their sorrows, and change
their darkness into light. Cause them to enter the garden of happiness,
cleanse them with the most pure water, and grant them to behold Thy
splendors on the loftiest mount.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O my God! O my God! Verily, Thy servant,...”


O my God! O my God! Verily, Thy servant, humble before the majesty of Thy
divine supremacy, lowly at the door of Thy oneness, hath believed in Thee
and in Thy verses, hath testified to Thy word, hath been enkindled with
the fire of Thy love, hath been immersed in the depths of the ocean of Thy
knowledge, hath been attracted by Thy breezes, hath relied upon Thee, hath
turned his face unto Thee, hath offered his supplications to Thee, and
hath been assured of Thy pardon and forgiveness. He hath abandoned this
mortal life and hath flown to the kingdom of immortality, yearning for the
favor of meeting Thee.

O Lord, glorify his station, shelter him under the pavilion of Thy supreme
mercy, cause him to enter Thy glorious paradise, and perpetuate his
existence in Thine exalted rose garden, that he may plunge into the sea of
light in the world of mysteries.

Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Powerful, the Forgiver and the
Bestower.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou forgiving Lord! Although some souls have...”


O Thou forgiving Lord!

Although some souls have spent the days of their lives in ignorance, and
became estranged and contumacious, yet, with one wave from the ocean of
Thy forgiveness, all those encompassed by sin will be set free. Whomsoever
Thou willest Thou makes a confidant, and whosoever is not the object of
Thy choice is accounted a transgressor. Shouldst Thou deal with us with
Thy justice, we are all naught but sinners and deserving to be shut out
from Thee, but shouldst Thou uphold mercy, every sinner would be made pure
and every stranger a friend. Bestow, then, Thy forgiveness and pardon, and
grant Thy mercy unto all.

Thou art the Forgiver, the Lightgiver and the Omnipotent

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




DETACHMENT



“Suffer me, O my God, to draw nigh unto Thee,...”


Suffer me, O my God, to draw nigh unto Thee, and to abide within the
precincts of Thy court, for remoteness from Thee hath well-nigh consumed
me. Cause me to rest under the shadow of the wings of Thy grace, for the
flame of my separation from Thee hath melted my heart within me. Draw me
nearer unto the river that is life indeed, for my soul burneth with thirst
in its ceaseless search after Thee. My sighs, O my God, proclaim the
bitterness of mine anguish, and the tears I shed attest my love for Thee.

I beseech Thee, by the praise wherewith Thou praisest Thyself and the
glory wherewith Thou glorifiest Thine own Essence, to grant that we may be
numbered among them that have recognized Thee and acknowledged Thy
sovereignty in Thy days. Help us then to quaff, O my God, from the fingers
of mercy the living waters of Thy loving-kindness, that we may utterly
forget all else except Thee, and be occupied only with Thy Self. Powerful
art Thou to do what Thou willest. No God is there beside Thee, the Mighty,
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Glorified be Thy name, O Thou Who art the King of all Kings!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O my God! I yield Thee...”


Glorified art Thou, O my God! I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast made
known unto me Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy mercy, and the Dawning-Place
of Thy grace, and the Repository of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy Name,
through which the faces of them that are nigh unto Thee have turned white,
and the hearts of such as are devoted to Thee have winged their flight
towards Thee, to grant that I may, at all times and under all conditions,
lay hold on Thy cord, and be rid of all attachment to anyone except Thee,
and may keep mine eyes directed towards the horizon of Thy Revelation, and
may carry out what Thou hast prescribed unto me in Thy Tablets.

Attire, O my Lord, both my inner and outer being with the raiment of Thy
favors and Thy loving-kindness. Keep me safe, then, from whatsoever may be
abhorrent unto Thee, and graciously assist me and my kindred to obey Thee,
and to shun whatsoever may stir up any evil or corrupt desire within me.

Thou, truly, art the Lord of all mankind, and the Possessor of this world
and of the next. No God is there save Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I entreat Thee...”


Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I entreat Thee by the fragrances of the
Raiment of Thy grace which at Thy bidding and in conformity with Thy
desire were diffused throughout the entire creation, and by the Daystar of
Thy will that hath shone brightly, through the power of Thy might and of
Thy sovereignty, above the horizon of Thy mercy, to blot out from my heart
all idle fancies and vain imaginings, that with all my affections I may
turn unto Thee, O Thou Lord of all mankind!

I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, O my God! I have laid hold on
the handle of Thy grace, and clung to the cord of Thy tender mercy. Ordain
for me the good things that are with Thee, and nourish me from the Table
Thou didst send down out of the clouds of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy
favor.

Thou, in very truth, art the Lord of the worlds, and the God of all that
are in heaven and all that are on earth.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been...”


Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been set ablaze with the fire of Thy
Cause, and many a slumberer hath been wakened by the sweetness of Thy
voice. How many are the strangers who have sought shelter beneath the
shadow of the tree of Thy oneness, and how numerous the thirsty ones who
have panted after the fountain of Thy living waters in Thy days!

Blessed is he that hath set himself towards Thee, and hasted to attain the
Dayspring of the lights of Thy face. Blessed is he who with all his
affections hath turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the
Fountainhead of Thine inspiration. Blessed is he that hath expended in Thy
path what Thou didst bestow upon him through Thy bounty and favor. Blessed
is he who, in his sore longing after Thee, hath cast away all else except
Thyself. Blessed is he who hath enjoyed intimate communion with Thee, and
rid himself of all attachment to anyone save Thee.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Him Who is Thy Name, Who, through the power
of Thy sovereignty and might, hath risen above the horizon of His prison,
to ordain for everyone what becometh Thee and beseemeth Thine exaltation.

Thy might, in truth, is equal to all things.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which...”


I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which Thou didst kindle in Thy
land. Earth can never cloud its splendor, nor water quench its flame. All
the peoples of the world are powerless to resist its force. Great is the
blessedness of him that hath drawn nigh unto it, and heard its roaring.

Some, O my God, Thou didst, through Thy strengthening grace, enable to
approach it, while others Thou didst keep back by reason of what their
hands have wrought in Thy days. Whoso hath hasted towards it and attained
unto it hath, in his eagerness to gaze on Thy beauty, yielded his life in
Thy path, and ascended unto Thee, wholly detached from aught else except
Thyself.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by this Fire which blazeth and rageth in the
world of creation, to rend asunder the veils that have hindered me from
appearing before the throne of Thy majesty, and from standing at the door
of Thy gate. Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, every good thing Thou didst
send down in Thy Book, and suffer me not to be far removed from the
shelter of Thy mercy.

Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the
All-Powerful, the Most Generous.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praise be unto Thee, O my God! I am one of...”


Praise be unto Thee, O my God! I am one of Thy servants, who hath believed
on Thee and on Thy signs. Thou seest how I have set myself towards the
door of Thy mercy, and turned my face in the direction of Thy
loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, by Thy most excellent titles and Thy most
exalted attributes, to open to my face the portals of Thy bestowals. Aid
me, then, to do that which is good, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all
names and attributes!

I am poor, O my Lord, and Thou art the Rich. I have set my face towards
Thee, and detached myself from all but Thee. Deprive me not, I implore
Thee, of the breezes of Thy tender mercy, and withhold not from me what
Thou didst ordain for the chosen among Thy servants.

Remove the veil from mine eyes, O my Lord, that I may recognize what Thou
hast desired for Thy creatures, and discover, in all the manifestations of
Thy handiwork, the revelations of Thine almighty power. Enrapture my soul,
O my Lord, with Thy most mighty signs, and draw me out of the depths of my
corrupt and evil desires. Write down, then, for me the good of this world
and of the world to come. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. No God
is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, Whose help is sought by all men.

I yield Thee thanks, O my Lord, that Thou hast wakened me from my sleep,
and stirred me up, and created in me the desire to perceive what most of
Thy servants have failed to apprehend. Make me able, therefore, O my Lord,
to behold, for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy pleasure, whatsoever
Thou hast desired. Thou art He to the power of Whose might and sovereignty
all things testify.

There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Beneficent.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“In the Name of thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign,...”


In the Name of thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign, the All-Sufficing,
the Most Exalted, He Whose help is implored by all men.

Say: O my God! O Thou Who art the Maker of the heavens and of the earth, O
Lord of the Kingdom! Thou well knowest the secrets of my heart, while Thy
Being is inscrutable to all save Thyself. Thou seest whatsoever is of me,
while no one else can do this save Thee. Vouchsafe unto me, through Thy
grace, what will enable me to dispense with all except Thee, and destine
for me that which will make me independent of everyone else besides Thee.
Grant that I may reap the benefit of my life in this world and in the
next. Open to my face the portals of Thy grace, and graciously confer upon
me Thy tender mercy and bestowals.

O Thou Who art the Lord of grace abounding! Let Thy celestial aid surround
those who love Thee, and bestow upon us the gifts and the bounties Thou
dost possess. Be Thou sufficient unto us of all things, forgive our sins
and have mercy upon us. Thou art Our Lord and the Lord of all created
things. No one else do we invoke but Thee, and naught do we beseech but
Thy favors. Thou art the Lord of bounty and grace, invincible in Thy power
and the most skillful in Thy designs. No God is there but Thee, the
All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.

Confer Thy blessings, O my Lord, upon the Messengers, the holy ones and
the righteous. Verily, Thou art God, the Peerless, the All-Compelling.

“O Lord! Unto Thee I repair for refuge, and...”


O Lord! Unto Thee I repair for refuge, and toward all Thy signs I set my
heart.

O Lord! Whether traveling or at home, and in my occupation or in my work,
I place my whole trust in Thee.

Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me independent of all
things, O Thou Who art unsurpassed in Thy mercy!

Bestow upon me my portion, O Lord, as Thou pleasest, and cause me to be
satisfied with whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me.

Thine is the absolute authority to command.

—The Báb



“O God, my God! Thou art my Hope and my...”


O God, my God! Thou art my Hope and my Beloved, my highest Aim and Desire!
With great humbleness and entire devotion I pray to Thee to make me a
minaret of Thy love in Thy land, a lamp of Thy knowledge among Thy
creatures, and a banner of divine bounty in Thy dominion.

Number me with such of Thy servants as have detached themselves from
everything but Thee, have sanctified themselves from the transitory things
of this world, and have freed themselves from the promptings of the
voicers of idle fancies.

Let my heart be dilated with joy through the spirit of confirmation from
Thy kingdom, and brighten my eyes by beholding the hosts of divine
assistance descending successively upon me from the kingdom of Thine
omnipotent glory.

Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment...”


O God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment from all things, and
in the assembly of Thy splendors and bestowals, rejoice me with the wine
of loving Thee. Free me from the assaults of passion and desire, break off
from me the shackles of this nether world, draw me with rapture unto Thy
supernal realm, and refresh me amongst the handmaids with the breathings
of Thy holiness.

O Lord, brighten Thou my face with the lights of Thy bestowals, light Thou
mine eyes with beholding the signs of Thine all-subduing might; delight my
heart with the glory of Thy knowledge that encompasseth all things,
gladden Thou my soul with Thy soul-reviving tidings of great joy, O Thou
King of this world and the Kingdom above, O Thou Lord of dominion and
might, that I may spread abroad Thy signs and tokens, and proclaim Thy
Cause, and promote Thy Teachings, and serve Thy Law and exalt Thy Word.

Thou art, verily, the Powerful, the Ever-Giving, the Able, the Omnipotent.

EVENING



“O my God, my Master, the Goal of my desire!...”


O my God, my Master, the Goal of my desire! This, Thy servant, seeketh to
sleep in the shelter of Thy mercy, and to repose beneath the canopy of Thy
grace, imploring Thy care and Thy protection.

I beg of Thee, O my Lord, by Thine eye that sleepeth not, to guard mine
eyes from beholding aught beside Thee. Strengthen, then, their vision that
they may discern Thy signs, and behold the Horizon of Thy Revelation. Thou
art He before the revelations of Whose omnipotence the quintessence of
power hath trembled.

No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the
Unconditioned.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“How can I choose to sleep, O God, my God,...”


How can I choose to sleep, O God, my God, when the eyes of them that long
for Thee are wakeful because of their separation from Thee; and how can I
lie down to rest whilst the souls of Thy lovers are sore vexed in their
remoteness from Thy presence?

I have committed, O my Lord, my spirit and my entire being into the right
hand of Thy might and Thy protection, and I lay my head on my pillow
through Thy power, and lift it up according to Thy will and Thy good
pleasure. Thou art, in truth, the Preserver, the Keeper, the Almighty, the
Most Powerful.

By Thy might! I ask not, whether sleeping or waking, but that which Thou
dost desire. I am Thy servant and in Thy hands. Do Thou graciously aid me
to do what will shed forth the fragrance of Thy good pleasure. This,
truly, is my hope and the hope of them that enjoy near access to Thee.
Praised be Thou, O Lord of the worlds!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O Lord, I have turned my face unto Thy kingdom...”


O seeker of Truth! If thou desirest that God may open thine eye, thou must
supplicate unto God, pray to and commune with Him at midnight, saying:

O Lord, I have turned my face unto Thy kingdom of oneness and am immersed
in the sea of Thy mercy. O Lord, enlighten my sight by beholding Thy
lights in this dark night, and make me happy by the wine of Thy love in
this wonderful age. O Lord, make me hear Thy call, and open before my face
the doors of Thy heaven, so that I may see the light of Thy glory and
become attracted to Thy beauty.

Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Generous, the Merciful, the Forgiving.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




FAMILIES



“Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beg...”


Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beg Thee to forgive me and those who
support Thy Faith. Verily, Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Forgiver, the
Most Generous. O my God! Enable such servants of Thine as are deprived of
knowledge to be admitted into Thy Cause; for once they learn of Thee, they
bear witness to the truth of the Day of Judgment and do not dispute the
revelations of Thy bounty. Send down upon them the tokens of Thy grace,
and grant them, wherever they reside, a liberal share of that which Thou
hast ordained for the pious among Thy servants. Thou art in truth the
Supreme Ruler, the All-Bounteous, the Most Benevolent.

O my God! Let the outpourings of Thy bounty and blessings descend upon
homes whose inmates have embraced Thy Faith, as a token of Thy grace and
as a mark of loving-kindness from Thy presence. Verily, unsurpassed art
Thou in granting forgiveness. Should Thy bounty be withheld from anyone,
how could he be reckoned among the followers of the Faith in Thy Day?

Bless me, O my God, and those who will believe in Thy signs on the
appointed Day, and such as cherish my love in their hearts—a love which
Thou dost instill into them. Verily, Thou art the Lord of righteousness,
the Most Exalted.

—The Báb



“I beg Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore...”


I beg Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore pardon after the manner Thou
wishest Thy servants to direct themselves to Thee. I beg of Thee to wash
away our sins as befitteth Thy Lordship, and to forgive me, my parents,
and those who in Thy estimation have entered the abode of Thy love in a
manner which is worthy of Thy transcendent sovereignty and well beseemeth
the glory of Thy celestial power.

O my God! Thou hast inspired my soul to offer its supplication to Thee,
and but for Thee, I would not call upon Thee. Lauded and glorified art
Thou; I yield Thee praise inasmuch as Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me,
and I beg Thee to forgive me, since I have fallen short in my duty to know
Thee and have failed to walk in the path of Thy love.

—The Báb



“O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou...”


O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou dost accept the intercession
of children in behalf of their parents. This is one of the special
infinite bestowals of this Dispensation. Therefore, O Thou kind Lord,
accept the request of this Thy servant at the threshold of Thy singleness
and submerge his father in the ocean of Thy grace, because this son hath
arisen to render Thee service and is exerting effort at all times in the
pathway of Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Forgiver and the
Kind!

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, my God! This Thy handmaid is calling...”


O God, my God! This Thy handmaid is calling upon Thee, trusting in Thee,
turning her face unto Thee, imploring Thee to shed Thy heavenly bounties
upon her, and to disclose unto her Thy spiritual mysteries, and to cast
upon her the lights of Thy Godhead.

O my Lord! Make the eyes of my husband to see. Rejoice Thou his heart with
the light of the knowledge of Thee, draw Thou his mind unto Thy luminous
beauty, cheer Thou his spirit by revealing unto him Thy manifest
splendors.

O my Lord! Lift Thou the veil from before his sight. Rain down Thy
plenteous bounties upon him, intoxicate him with the wine of love for
Thee, make him one of Thy angels whose feet walk upon this earth even as
their souls are soaring through the high heavens. Cause him to become a
brilliant lamp, shining out with the light of Thy wisdom in the midst of
Thy people.

Verily, Thou art the Precious, the Ever-Bestowing, the Open of Hand.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“My Lord! My Lord! I praise Thee and I thank...”


My Lord! My Lord! I praise Thee and I thank Thee for that whereby Thou
hast favored Thine humble maidservant, Thy slave beseeching and
supplicating Thee, because Thou hast verily guided her unto Thine obvious
Kingdom and caused her to hear Thine exalted Call in the contingent world
and to behold Thy Signs which prove the appearance of Thy victorious reign
over all things.

O my Lord, I dedicate that which is in my womb unto Thee. Then cause it to
be a praiseworthy child in Thy Kingdom and a fortunate one by Thy favor
and Thy generosity; to develop and to grow up under the charge of Thine
education. Verily, Thou art the Gracious! Verily, Thou art the Lord of
Great Favor!

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




FIRMNESS IN THE COVENANT



“Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, and the...”


Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, and the Maker of nations, and the
Fashioner of every moldering bone! I pray Thee, by Thy Name through which
Thou didst call all mankind unto the horizon of Thy majesty and glory, and
didst guide Thy servants to the court of Thy grace and favors, to number
me with such as have rid themselves from everything except Thyself, and
have set themselves towards Thee, and have not been kept back by such
misfortunes as were decreed by Thee, from turning in the direction of Thy
gifts.

I have laid hold, O my Lord, on the handle of Thy bounty, and clung
steadfastly to the hem of the robe of Thy favor. Send down, then, upon me,
out of the clouds of Thy generosity, what will purge out from me the
remembrance of anyone except Thee, and make me able to turn unto Him Who
is the Object of the adoration of all mankind, against Whom have been
arrayed the stirrers of sedition, who have broken Thy covenant, and
disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs.

Deny me not, O my Lord, the fragrances of Thy raiment in Thy days, and
deprive me not of the breathings of Thy Revelation at the appearance of
the splendors of the light of Thy face. Powerful art Thou to do what
pleaseth Thee. Naught can resist Thy will, nor frustrate what Thou hast
purposed by Thy power.

No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“He is the Mighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate!...”


He is the Mighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate!

O God, my God! Thou beholdest Thy servants in the abyss of perdition and
error; where is Thy light of divine guidance, O Thou the Desire of the
world? Thou knowest their helplessness and their feebleness; where is Thy
power, O Thou in Whose grasp lie the powers of heaven and earth?

I ask Thee, O Lord my God, by the splendor of the lights of Thy
loving-kindness and the billows of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom
and by Thy Word wherewith Thou hast swayed the peoples of Thy dominion, to
grant that I may be one of them that have observed Thy bidding in Thy
Book. And do Thou ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy
trusted ones, them that have quaffed the wine of divine inspiration from
the chalice of Thy bounty and hastened to do Thy pleasure and observe Thy
Covenant and Testament. Powerful art Thou to do as Thou willest. There is
none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Decree for me, by Thy bounty, O Lord, that which shall prosper me in this
world and hereafter and shall draw me nigh unto Thee, O Thou Who art the
Lord of all men. There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Mighty,
the Glorified.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Make firm our steps, O Lord, in Thy path...”


Make firm our steps, O Lord, in Thy path and strengthen Thou our hearts in
Thine obedience. Turn our faces toward the beauty of Thy oneness, and
gladden our bosoms with the signs of Thy divine unity. Adorn our bodies
with the robe of Thy bounty, and remove from our eyes the veil of
sinfulness, and give us the chalice of Thy grace; that the essence of all
beings may sing Thy praise before the vision of Thy grandeur. Reveal then
Thyself, O Lord, by Thy merciful utterance and the mystery of Thy divine
being, that the holy ecstasy of prayer may fill our souls—a prayer that
shall rise above words and letters and transcend the murmur of syllables
and sounds—that all things may be merged into nothingness before the
revelation of Thy splendor.

Lord! These are servants that have remained fast and firm in Thy Covenant
and Thy Testament, that have held fast unto the cord of constancy in Thy
Cause and clung unto the hem of the robe of Thy grandeur. Assist them, O
Lord, with Thy grace, confirm with Thy power and strengthen their loins in
obedience to Thee.

Thou art the Pardoner, the Gracious.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O compassionate God! Thanks be to Thee for...”


O compassionate God! Thanks be to Thee for Thou hast awakened and made me
conscious. Thou hast given me a seeing eye and favored me with a hearing
ear, hast led me to Thy kingdom and guided me to Thy path. Thou hast shown
me the right way and caused me to enter the ark of deliverance. O God!
Keep me steadfast and make me firm and staunch. Protect me from violent
tests, and preserve and shelter me in the strongly fortified fortress of
Thy Covenant and Testament. Thou art the Powerful. Thou art the Seeing.
Thou art the Hearing.

O Thou the Compassionate God. Bestow upon me a heart which, like unto
glass, may be illumined with the light of Thy love, and confer upon me
thoughts which may change this world into a rose garden through the
outpourings of heavenly grace.

Thou art the Compassionate, the Merciful. Thou art the Great Beneficent
God.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy...”


O my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy
mighty Covenant, to remain faithful to Thy manifest Cause, and to carry
out the commandments Thou didst set down for them in Thy Book of
Splendors; that they may become banners of guidance and lamps of the
Company above, wellsprings of Thine infinite wisdom, and stars that lead
aright, as they shine down from the supernal sky.

Verily, art Thou the Invincible, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

FORGIVENESS



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Chosen Ones, and
by the Bearers of Thy Trust, and by Him Whom Thou hast ordained to be the
Seal of Thy Prophets and of Thy Messengers, to let Thy remembrance be my
companion, and Thy love my aim, and Thy face my goal, and Thy name my
lamp, and Thy wish my desire, and Thy pleasure my delight.

I am a sinner, O my Lord, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving. As soon as I
recognized Thee, I hastened to attain the exalted court of Thy
loving-kindness. Forgive me, O my Lord, my sins which have hindered me
from walking in the ways of Thy good pleasure, and from attaining the
shores of the ocean of Thy oneness.

There is no one, O my Lord, who can deal bountifully with me to whom I can
turn my face, and none who can have compassion on me that I may crave his
mercy. Cast me not out, I implore Thee, of the presence of Thy grace,
neither do Thou withhold from me the outpourings of Thy generosity and
bounty. Ordain for me, O my Lord, what Thou hast ordained for them that
love Thee, and write down for me what Thou hast written down for Thy
chosen ones. My gaze hath, at all times, been fixed on the horizon of Thy
gracious providence, and mine eyes bent upon the court of Thy tender
mercies. Do with me as beseemeth Thee. No God is there but Thee, the God
of power, the God of glory, Whose help is implored by all men.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“I am he, O my Lord, that hath set his face towards...”


I am he, O my Lord, that hath set his face towards Thee, and fixed his
hope on the wonders of Thy grace and the revelations of Thy bounty. I pray
Thee that Thou wilt not suffer me to turn away disappointed from the door
of Thy mercy, nor abandon me to such of Thy creatures as have repudiated
Thy Cause.

I am, O my God, Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have recognized
Thy truth in Thy days, and have directed my steps towards the shores of
Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, acknowledging Thy unity, and
hoping for Thy forgiveness and pardon. Powerful art Thou to do what Thou
willest; no God is there beside Thee, the All-Glorious, the
Ever-Forgiving.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Thou seest me, O my Lord, with my face...”


Thou seest me, O my Lord, with my face turned towards the heaven of Thy
bounty and the ocean of Thy favor, withdrawn from all else beside Thee. I
ask of Thee, by the splendors of the Sun of Thy revelation on Sinai, and
the effulgences of the Orb of Thy grace which shineth from the horizon of
Thy Name, the Ever-Forgiving, to grant me Thy pardon and to have mercy
upon me. Write down, then, for me with Thy pen of glory that which will
exalt me through Thy Name in the world of creation. Aid me, O my Lord, to
set myself towards Thee, and to hearken unto the voice of Thy loved ones,
whom the powers of the earth have failed to weaken, and the dominion of
the nations has been powerless to withhold from Thee, and who, advancing
towards Thee, have said: “God is our Lord, the Lord of all who are in
heaven and all who are on earth!”

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I venture to make mention of
Thee, I am held back by my mighty sins and grievous trespasses against
Thee, and find myself wholly deprived of Thy grace, and utterly powerless
to celebrate Thy praise. My great confidence in Thy bounty, however,
reviveth my hope in Thee, and my certitude that Thou wilt bountifully deal
with me emboldeneth me to extol Thee, and to ask of Thee the things Thou
dost possess.

I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy mercy that hath surpassed all created
things, and to which all that are immersed beneath the oceans of Thy names
bear witness, not to abandon me unto my self, for my heart is prone to
evil. Guard me, then, within the stronghold of Thy protection and the
shelter of Thy care. I am he, O my God, whose only wish is what Thou hast
determined by the power of Thy might. All I have chosen for myself is to
be assisted by Thy gracious appointments and the ruling of Thy will, and
to be aided with the tokens of Thy decree and judgment.

I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of the hearts which long for
Thee, by the Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Daysprings of Thine
inspiration, and the Exponents of Thy majesty, and the Treasuries of Thy
knowledge, not to suffer me to be deprived of Thy holy Habitation, Thy
Fane and Thy Tabernacle. Aid me, O my Lord, to attain His hallowed court,
and to circle round His person, and to stand humbly at His door.

Thou art He Whose power is from everlasting to everlasting. Nothing
escapeth Thy knowledge. Thou art, verily, the God of power, the God of
glory and wisdom.

Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of...”


Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of all things, my Glory and the
Glory of all things, my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength
and the Strength of all things, my King and the King of all things, my
Possessor and the Possessor of all things, my Aim and the Aim of all
things, my Mover and the Mover of all things! Suffer me not, I implore
Thee, to be kept back from the ocean of Thy tender mercies, nor to be far
removed from the shores of nearness to Thee.

Aught else except Thee, O my Lord, profiteth me not, and near access to
anyone save Thyself availeth me nothing. I entreat Thee by the
plenteousness of Thy riches, whereby Thou didst dispense with all else
except Thyself, to number me with such as have set their faces towards
Thee, and arisen to serve Thee.

Forgive, then, O my Lord, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens. Thou, truly,
art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy...”


O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy grace from whatsoever may be
repugnant unto Thee, and vouchsafe unto us that which well beseemeth Thee.
Give us more out of Thy bounty, and bless us. Pardon us for the things we
have done, and wash away our sins, and forgive us with Thy gracious
forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.

Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created things in the heavens
and on the earth, and Thy forgiveness hath surpassed the whole creation.
Thine is sovereignty; in Thy hand are the Kingdoms of Creation and
Revelation; in Thy right hand Thou holdest all created things, and within
Thy grasp are the assigned measures of forgiveness. Thou forgivest
whomsoever among Thy servants Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the
Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge,
and naught is there which is hidden from Thee.

O God our Lord! Protect us through the potency of Thy might, enable us to
enter Thy wondrous surging ocean, and grant us that which well befitteth
Thee.

Thou art the Sovereign Ruler, the Mighty Doer, the Exalted, the
All-Loving.

—The Báb



“Praise be unto Thee, O Lord. Forgive us our...”


Praise be unto Thee, O Lord. Forgive us our sins, have mercy upon us and
enable us to return unto Thee. Suffer us not to rely on aught else besides
Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, through Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest
and desirest and well beseemeth Thee. Exalt the station of them that have
truly believed, and forgive them with Thy gracious forgiveness. Verily,
Thou art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—The Báb



“I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every...”


I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every mention but the mention of
Thee, and for every praise but the praise of Thee, and for every delight
but delight in Thy nearness, and for every pleasure but the pleasure of
communion with Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy love and of Thy
good-pleasure, and for all things pertaining unto me which bear no
relationship unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of lords, He Who provideth
the means and unlocketh the doors.

—The Báb



“Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make...”


Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make mention of Thee while Thou art
sanctified from the praise of all mankind. Magnified be Thy Name, O God,
Thou art the King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest what is in the heavens
and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return. Thou hast sent down Thy
divinely ordained Revelation according to a clear measure. Praised art
Thou, O Lord! At Thy behest Thou dost render victorious whomsoever Thou
willest, through the hosts of heaven and earth and whatsoever existeth
between them. Thou art the Sovereign, the Eternal Truth, the Lord of
invincible might.

Glorified art Thou, O Lord, Thou forgivest at all times the sins of such
among Thy servants as implore Thy pardon. Wash away my sins and the sins
of those who seek Thy forgiveness at dawn, who pray to Thee in the daytime
and in the night season, who yearn after naught save God, who offer up
whatsoever God hath graciously bestowed upon them, who celebrate Thy
praise at morn and eventide, and who are not remiss in their duties.

—The Báb



“O Thou forgiving Lord! Thou art the shelter...”


O Thou forgiving Lord! Thou art the shelter of all these Thy servants.
Thou knowest the secrets and art aware of all things. We are all helpless,
and Thou art the Mighty, the Omnipotent. We are all sinners, and Thou art
the Forgiver of sins, the Merciful, the Compassionate. O Lord! Look not at
our shortcomings. Deal with us according to Thy grace and bounty. Our
shortcomings are many, but the ocean of Thy forgiveness is boundless. Our
weakness is grievous, but the evidences of Thine aid and assistance are
clear. Therefore, confirm and strengthen us. Enable us to do that which is
worthy of Thy holy Threshold. Illumine our hearts, grant us discerning
eyes and attentive ears. Resuscitate the dead and heal the sick. Bestow
wealth upon the poor and give peace and security to the fearful. Accept us
in Thy kingdom and illumine us with the light of guidance. Thou are the
Powerful and the Omnipotent. Thou art the Generous. Thou art the Clement.
Thou art the Kind.

THE FUND



“O God, my God! Illumine the brows of Thy...”


All the friends of God ... should contribute to the extent possible,
however modest their offering may be. God doth not burden a soul beyond
its capacity. Such contributions must come from all centers and all
believers. ... O Friends of God! Be ye assured that in place of these
contributions, your agriculture, your industry, and your commerce will be
blessed by manifold increases, with goodly gifts and bestowals. He who
cometh with one goodly deed will receive a tenfold reward. There is no
doubt that the living Lord will abundantly confirm those who expend their
wealth in His path.

O God, my God! Illumine the brows of Thy true lovers, and support them
with angelic hosts of certain triumph. Set firm their feet on Thy straight
path, and out of Thine ancient bounty open before them the portals of Thy
blessings; for they are expending on Thy pathway what Thou hast bestowed
upon them, safeguarding Thy Faith, putting their trust in their
remembrance of Thee, offering up their hearts for love of Thee, and
withholding not what they possess in adoration for Thy Beauty and in their
search for ways to please Thee.

O my Lord! Ordain for them a plenteous share, a destined recompense and
sure reward.

Verily, Thou art the Sustainer, the Helper, the Generous, the Bountiful,
the Ever-Bestowing.

HEALING



“O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the ocean...”


O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the ocean of Thy healing, and by the
splendors of the Daystar of Thy grace, and by Thy Name through which Thou
didst subdue Thy servants, and by the pervasive power of Thy most exalted
Word and the potency of Thy most august Pen, and by Thy mercy that hath
preceded the creation of all who are in heaven and on earth, to purge me
with the waters of Thy bounty from every affliction and disorder, and from
all weakness and feebleness.

Thou seest, O my Lord, Thy suppliant waiting at the door of Thy bounty,
and him who hath set his hopes on Thee clinging to the cord of Thy
generosity. Deny him not, I beseech Thee, the things he seeketh from the
ocean of Thy grace and the Daystar of Thy loving-kindness.

Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. There is none other God save
Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Thy name is my healing, O my God, and remembrance...”


Thy name is my healing, O my God, and remembrance of Thee is my remedy.
Nearness to Thee is my hope, and love for Thee is my companion. Thy mercy
to me is my healing and my succor in both this world and the world to
come. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore...”


Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by Thy Name, through which
Thou didst lift up the ensigns of Thy guidance, and didst shed the
radiance of Thy loving-kindness, and didst reveal the sovereignty of Thy
Lordship; through which the lamp of Thy names hath appeared within the
niche of Thine attributes, and He Who is the Tabernacle of Thy unity and
the Manifestation of detachment hath shone forth; through which the ways
of Thy guidance were made known, and the paths of Thy good pleasure were
marked out; through which the foundations of error have been made to
tremble, and the signs of wickedness have been abolished; through which
the fountains of wisdom have burst forth, and the heavenly table hath been
sent down; through which Thou didst preserve Thy servants and didst
vouchsafe Thy healing; through which Thou didst show forth Thy tender
mercies unto Thy servants and revealedst Thy forgiveness amidst Thy
creatures—I implore Thee to keep safe him who hath held fast and returned
unto Thee, and clung to Thy mercy, and seized the hem of Thy loving
providence. Send down, then, upon him Thy healing, and make him whole, and
endue him with a constancy vouchsafed by Thee, and a tranquillity bestowed
by Thy highness.

Thou art, verily, the Healer, the Preserver, the Helper, the Almighty, the
Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore...”


Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Most Great Name
through which Thou didst stir up Thy servants and build up Thy cities, and
by Thy most excellent titles, and Thy most august attributes, to assist
Thy people to turn in the direction of Thy manifold bounties, and set
their faces towards the Tabernacle of Thy wisdom. Heal Thou the sicknesses
that have assailed the souls on every side, and have deterred them from
directing their gaze towards the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy
shadowing Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the King of all names unto
all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Potent art Thou to do as
pleaseth Thee. In Thy hands is the empire of all names. There is none
other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.

I am but a poor creature, O my Lord; I have clung to the hem of Thy
riches. I am sore sick; I have held fast the cord of Thy healing. Deliver
me from the ills that have encircled me, and wash me thoroughly with the
waters of Thy graciousness and mercy, and attire me with the raiment of
wholesomeness, through Thy forgiveness and bounty. Fix, then, mine eyes
upon Thee, and rid me of all attachment to aught else except Thyself. Aid
me to do what Thou desirest, and to fulfill what Thou pleasest.

Thou art truly the Lord of this life and of the next. Thou art, in truth,
the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beg of...”


Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beg of Thee by Thy Name through which
He Who is Thy Beauty hath been stablished upon the throne of Thy Cause,
and by Thy Name through which Thou changest all things, and gatherest
together all things, and callest to account all things, and rewardest all
things, and preservest all things, and sustainest all things—I beg of Thee
to guard this handmaiden who hath fled for refuge to Thee, and hath sought
the shelter of Him in Whom Thou Thyself art manifest, and hath put her
whole trust and confidence in Thee.

She is sick, O my God, and hath entered beneath the shadow of the Tree of
Thy healing; afflicted, and hath fled to the City of Thy protection;
diseased, and hath sought the Fountainhead of Thy favors; sorely vexed,
and hath hasted to attain the Wellspring of Thy tranquillity; burdened
with sin, and hath set her face toward the court of Thy forgiveness.

Attire her, by Thy sovereignty and Thy loving-kindness, O my God and my
Beloved, with the raiment of Thy balm and Thy healing, and make her quaff
of the cup of Thy mercy and Thy favors. Protect her, moreover, from every
affliction and ailment, from all pain and sickness, and from whatsoever
may be abhorrent unto Thee.

Thou, in truth, art immensely exalted above all else except Thyself. Thou
art, verily, the Healer, the All-Sufficing, the Preserver, the
Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.

—Bahá’u’lláh

the portals of Thy bounty and grace were opened wide, whereby the Temple
of Thy Holiness was established upon the throne of eternity; and by Thy
mercy whereby Thou didst invite all created things unto the table of Thy
bounties and bestowals; and by Thy grace whereby Thou didst respond, in
Thine own Self with Thy word “Yea!” on behalf of all in heaven and earth,
at the hour when Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur stood revealed, at the
dawn-time when the might of Thy dominion was made manifest. And again do I
beseech Thee, by these most beauteous names, by these most noble and
sublime attributes, and by Thy most Exalted Remembrance, and by Thy pure
and spotless Beauty, and by Thy hidden Light in the most hidden pavilion,
and by Thy Name, cloaked with the garment of affliction every morn and
eve, to protect the bearer of this blessed Tablet, and whoso reciteth it,
and whoso cometh upon it, and whoso passeth around the house wherein it
is. Heal Thou, then, by it every sick, diseased and poor one, from every
tribulation and distress, from every loathsome affliction and sorrow, and
guide Thou by it whosoever desireth to enter upon the paths of Thy
guidance, and the ways of Thy forgiveness and grace.

Thou art verily the Powerful, the All-Sufficing, the Healing, the
Protector, the Giving, the Compassionate, the All-Generous, the
All-Merciful.

MANKIND



“My God, Whom I worship and adore! I bear...”


My God, Whom I worship and adore! I bear witness unto Thy unity and Thy
oneness, and acknowledge Thy gifts, both in the past and in the present.
Thou art the All-Bountiful, the overflowing showers of Whose mercy have
rained down upon high and low alike, and the splendors of Whose grace have
been shed over both the obedient and the rebellious.

O God of mercy, before Whose door the quintessence of mercy hath bowed
down, and round the sanctuary of Whose Cause loving-kindness, in its
inmost spirit, hath circled, we beseech Thee, entreating Thine ancient
grace, and seeking Thy present favor, that Thou mayest have mercy upon all
who are the manifestations of the world of being, and deny them not the
outpourings of Thy grace in Thy days.

All are but poor and needy, and Thou, verily, art the All-Possessing, the
All-Subduing, the All-Powerful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O Thou compassionate Lord, Thou Who art...”


O Thou compassionate Lord, Thou Who art generous and able! We are servants
of Thine sheltered beneath Thy providence. Cast Thy glance of favor upon
us. Give light to our eyes, hearing to our ears, and understanding and
love to our hearts. Render our souls joyous and happy through Thy glad
tidings. O Lord! Point out to us the pathway of Thy kingdom and
resuscitate all of us through the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Bestow upon
us life everlasting and confer upon us never-ending honor. Unify mankind
and illumine the world of humanity. May we all follow Thy pathway, long
for Thy good pleasure and seek the mysteries of Thy kingdom. O God! Unite
us and connect our hearts with Thy indissoluble bond. Verily, Thou art the
Giver, Thou art the Kind One and Thou art the Almighty.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou kind Lord! O Thou Who art generous...”


O Thou kind Lord! O Thou Who art generous and merciful! We are servants of
Thy threshold and are gathered beneath the sheltering shadow of Thy divine
unity. The sun of Thy mercy is shining upon all, and the clouds of Thy
bounty shower upon all. Thy gifts encompass all, Thy loving providence
sustains all, Thy protection overshadows all, and the glances of Thy favor
are cast upon all. O Lord! Grant Thine infinite bestowals, and let the
light of Thy guidance shine. Illumine the eyes, gladden the hearts with
abiding joy. Confer a new spirit upon all people and bestow upon them
eternal life. Unlock the gates of true understanding and let the light of
faith shine resplendent. Gather all people beneath the shadow of Thy
bounty and cause them to unite in harmony, so that they may become as the
rays of one sun, as the waves of one ocean, and as the fruit of one tree.
May they drink from the same fountain. May they be refreshed by the same
breeze. May they receive illumination from the same source of light. Thou
art the Giver, the Merciful, the Omnipotent.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou kind Lord! Thou hast created all...”


O Thou kind Lord! Thou hast created all humanity from the same stock. Thou
hast decreed that all shall belong to the same household. In Thy Holy
Presence they are all Thy servants, and all mankind are sheltered beneath
Thy Tabernacle; all have gathered together at Thy Table of Bounty; all are
illumined through the light of Thy Providence.

O God! Thou art kind to all, Thou hast provided for all, dost shelter all,
conferrest life upon all. Thou hast endowed each and all with talents and
faculties, and all are submerged in the Ocean of Thy Mercy.

O Thou kind Lord! Unite all. Let the religions agree and make the nations
one, so that they may see each other as one family and the whole earth as
one home. May they all live together in perfect harmony.

O God! Raise aloft the banner of the oneness of mankind.

O God! Establish the Most Great Peace.

Cement Thou, O God, the hearts together.

O Thou kind Father, God! Gladden our hearts through the fragrance of Thy
love. Brighten our eyes through the Light of Thy Guidance. Delight our
ears with the melody of Thy Word, and shelter us all in the Stronghold of
Thy Providence.

Thou art the Mighty and Powerful, Thou art the Forgiving and Thou art the
One Who overlooketh the shortcomings of all mankind.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendor...”


O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendor over the luminous realities of
men, shedding upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge and guidance,
and hast chosen them out of all created things for this supernal grace,
and hast caused them to encompass all things, to understand their inmost
essence, and to disclose their mysteries, bringing them forth out of
darkness into the visible world! “He verily showeth His special mercy to
whomsoever He will.”(2)

O Lord, help Thou Thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and the sciences and
arts, and to unravel the secrets that are treasured up in the inmost
reality of all created beings. Make them to hear the hidden truths that
are written and embedded in the heart of all that is. Make them to be
ensigns of guidance amongst all creatures, and piercing rays of the mind
shedding forth their light in this, the “first life.”(3) Make them to be
leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy path, runners urging men on to Thy
Kingdom.

Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector, the Potent, the Defender, the
Mighty, the Most Generous.

MARRIAGE



“He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!...”


“Bahá’í marriage is union and cordial affection between the two parties.
They must, however, exercise the utmost care and become acquainted with
each other’s character. This eternal bond should be made secure by a firm
covenant, and the intention should be to foster harmony, fellowship and
unity and to attain everlasting life.”

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá

The pledge of marriage, the verse to be spoken individually by the bride
and the bridegroom in the presence of at least two witnesses acceptable to
the Spiritual Assembly is, as stipulated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The Most
Holy Book):

“We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.”

He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!

Praise be to God, the Ancient, the Ever-Abiding, the Changeless, the
Eternal! He Who hath testified in His Own Being that verily He is the One,
the Single, the Untrammelled, the Exalted. We bear witness that verily
there is no God but Him, acknowledging His oneness, confessing His
singleness. He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable heights, in the summits
of His loftiness, sanctified from the mention of aught save Himself, free
from the description of aught but Him.

And when He desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men, and to set
the world in order, He revealed observances and created laws; among them
He established the law of marriage, made it as a fortress for well-being
and salvation, and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down out of
the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book. He saith, great is His
glory: “Marry, O people, that from you may appear he who will remember Me
amongst My servants; this is one of My commandments unto you; obey it as
an assistance to yourselves.”

—Bahá’u’lláh



“He is God!...”


He is God!

O peerless Lord! In Thine almighty wisdom Thou hast enjoined marriage upon
the peoples, that the generations of men may succeed one another in this
contingent world, and that ever, so long as the world shall last, they may
busy themselves at the Threshold of Thy oneness with servitude and
worship, with salutation, adoration and praise. “I have not created
spirits and men, but that they should worship me.”(4) Wherefore, wed Thou
in the heaven of Thy mercy these two birds of the nest of Thy love, and
make them the means of attracting perpetual grace; that from the union of
these two seas of love a wave of tenderness may surge and cast the pearls
of pure and goodly issue on the shore of life. “He hath let loose the two
seas, that they meet each other: Between them is a barrier which they
overpass not. Which then of the bounties of your Lord will ye deny? From
each He bringeth up greater and lesser pearls.”(5)

O Thou kind Lord! Make Thou this marriage to bring forth coral and pearls.
Thou art verily the All-Powerful, the Most Great, the Ever-Forgiving.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily, this...”


Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily, this Thy servant and this Thy
maidservant have gathered under the shadow of Thy mercy and they are
united through Thy favor and generosity. O Lord! Assist them in this Thy
world and Thy kingdom and destine for them every good through Thy bounty
and grace. O Lord! Confirm them in Thy servitude and assist them in Thy
service. Suffer them to become the signs of Thy Name in Thy world and
protect them through Thy bestowals which are inexhaustible in this world
and the world to come. O Lord! They are supplicating the kingdom of Thy
mercifulness and invoking the realm of Thy singleness. Verily, they are
married in obedience to Thy command. Cause them to become the signs of
harmony and unity until the end of time. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent,
the Omnipresent and the Almighty!

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O my Lord, O my Lord! These two bright...”


O my Lord, O my Lord! These two bright orbs are wedded in Thy love,
conjoined in servitude to Thy Holy Threshold, united in ministering to Thy
Cause. Make Thou this marriage to be as threading lights of Thine
abounding grace, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, the luminous rays of Thy
bestowals, O Thou the Beneficent, the Ever-Giving, that there may branch
out from this great tree boughs that will grow green and flourishing
through the gifts that rain down from Thy clouds of grace.

Verily, Thou art the Generous. Verily, Thou art the Almighty. Verily, Thou
art the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




MEETINGS



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I implore...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by the onrushing winds
of Thy grace, and by them Who are the Daysprings of Thy purpose and the
Dawning-Places of Thine inspiration, to send down upon me and upon all
that have sought Thy face that which beseemeth Thy generosity and
bountiful grace, and is worthy of Thy bestowals and favors. Poor and
desolate I am, O my Lord! Immerse me in the ocean of Thy wealth; athirst,
suffer me to drink from the living waters of Thy loving-kindness.

I beseech Thee, by Thine own Self and by Him Whom Thou hast appointed as
the Manifestation of Thine own Being and Thy discriminating Word unto all
that are in heaven and on earth, to gather together Thy servants beneath
the shade of the Tree of Thy gracious providence. Help them, then, to
partake of its fruits, to incline their ears to the rustling of its
leaves, and to the sweetness of the voice of the Bird that chanteth upon
its branches. Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the Inaccessible, the
Almighty, the Most Bountiful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O Thou merciful God! O Thou Who art...”


O Thou merciful God! O Thou Who art mighty and powerful! O Thou most kind
Father! These servants have gathered together, turning to Thee,
supplicating Thy threshold, desiring Thine endless bounties from Thy great
assurance. They have no purpose save Thy good pleasure. They have no
intention save service to the world of humanity.

O God! Make this assemblage radiant. Make the hearts merciful. Confer the
bounties of the Holy Spirit. Endow them with a power from heaven. Bless
them with heavenly minds. Increase their sincerity, so that with all
humility and contrition they may turn to Thy kingdom and be occupied with
service to the world of humanity. May each one become a radiant candle.
May each one become a brilliant star. May each one become beautiful in
color and redolent of fragrance in the kingdom of God.

O kind Father! Confer Thy blessings. Consider not our shortcomings.
Shelter us under Thy protection. Remember not our sins. Heal us with Thy
mercy. We are weak; Thou art mighty. We are poor; Thou art rich. We are
sick; Thou art the Physician. We are needy; Thou art most generous.

O God! Endow us with Thy providence. Thou art the Powerful. Thou art the
Giver. Thou art the Beneficent.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou kind Lord! These are Thy servants...”


O Thou kind Lord! These are Thy servants who have gathered in this
meeting, have turned unto Thy kingdom and are in need of Thy bestowal and
blessing. O Thou God! Manifest and make evident the signs of Thy oneness
which have been deposited in all the realities of life. Reveal and unfold
the virtues which Thou hast made latent and concealed in these human
realities.

O God! We are as plants, and Thy bounty is as the rain; refresh and cause
these plants to grow through Thy bestowal. We are Thy servants; free us
from the fetters of material existence. We are ignorant; make us wise. We
are dead; make us alive. We are material; endow us with spirit. We are
deprived; make us the intimates of Thy mysteries. We are needy; enrich and
bless us from Thy boundless treasury. O God! Resuscitate us; give us
sight; give us hearing; familiarize us with the mysteries of life, so that
the secrets of Thy kingdom may become revealed to us in this world of
existence and we may confess Thy oneness. Every bestowal emanates from
Thee; every benediction is Thine.

Thou art mighty. Thou art powerful. Thou art the Giver, and Thou art the
Ever-Bounteous.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O my God! O my God! Verily, these servants...”


O my God! O my God! Verily, these servants are turning to Thee,
supplicating Thy kingdom of mercy. Verily, they are attracted by Thy
holiness and set aglow with the fire of Thy love, seeking confirmation
from Thy wondrous kingdom, and hoping for attainment in Thy heavenly
realm. Verily, they long for the descent of Thy bestowal, desiring
illumination from the Sun of Reality. O Lord! Make them radiant lamps,
merciful signs, fruitful trees and shining stars. May they come forth in
Thy service and be connected with Thee by the bonds and ties of Thy love,
longing for the lights of Thy favor. O Lord! Make them signs of guidance,
standards of Thine immortal kingdom, waves of the sea of Thy mercy,
mirrors of the light of Thy majesty.

Verily, Thou art the Generous. Verily, Thou art the Merciful. Verily, Thou
art the Precious, the Beloved.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou forgiving God! These servants are...”


O Thou forgiving God! These servants are turning to Thy kingdom and
seeking Thy grace and bounty. O God! Make their hearts good and pure in
order that they may become worthy of Thy love. Purify and sanctify the
spirits that the light of the Sun of Reality may shine upon them. Purify
and sanctify the eyes that they may perceive Thy light. Purify and
sanctify the ears in order that they may hear the call of Thy kingdom.

O Lord! Verily, we are weak, but Thou art mighty. Verily, we are poor, but
Thou art rich. We are the seekers, and Thou art the One sought. O Lord!
Have compassion upon us and forgive us; bestow upon us such capacity and
receptiveness that we may be worthy of Thy favors and become attracted to
Thy kingdom, that we may drink deep of the water of life, may be enkindled
by the fire of Thy love, and be resuscitated through the breaths of the
Holy Spirit in this radiant century.

O God, my God! Cast upon this gathering the glances of Thy
loving-kindness. Keep safe each and all in Thy custody and under Thy
protection. Send down upon these souls Thy heavenly blessings. Immerse
them in the ocean of Thy mercy, and quicken them through the breaths of
the Holy Spirit.

O Lord! Bestow Thy gracious aid and confirmation upon this just
government. This country lieth beneath the sheltering shadow of Thy
protection, and this people is in Thy service. O Lord! Confer upon them
Thy heavenly bounty and render the outpourings of Thy grace and favor
copious and abundant. Suffer this esteemed nation to be held in honor, and
enable it to be admitted into Thy kingdom.

Thou art the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Merciful, and Thou art the
Generous, the Beneficent, the Lord of grace abounding.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Divine Providence! This assemblage is composed...”


O Divine Providence! This assemblage is composed of Thy friends who are
attracted to Thy beauty and are set ablaze by the fire of Thy love. Turn
these souls into heavenly angels, resuscitate them through the breath of
Thy Holy Spirit, grant them eloquent tongues and resolute hearts, bestow
upon them heavenly power and merciful susceptibilities, cause them to
become the promulgators of the oneness of mankind and the cause of love
and concord in the world of humanity, so that the perilous darkness of
ignorant prejudice may vanish through the light of the Sun of Truth, this
dreary world may become illumined, this material realm may absorb the rays
of the world of spirit, these different colors may merge into one color
and the melody of praise may rise to the kingdom of Thy sanctity.

Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, and the Almighty!

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




MORNING



“O my God and my Master! I am Thy servant...”


O my God and my Master! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I
have risen from my couch at this dawntide when the Daystar of Thy oneness
hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Thy will, and hath shed its
radiance upon the whole world, according to what had been ordained in the
Books of Thy Decree.

Praise be unto Thee, O my God, that we have wakened to the splendors of
the light of Thy knowledge. Send down, then, upon us, O my Lord, what will
enable us to dispense with anyone but Thee, and will rid us of all
attachment to aught except Thyself. Write down, moreover, for me, and for
such as are dear to me, and for my kindred, man and woman alike, the good
of this world and the world to come. Keep us safe, then, through Thine
unfailing protection, O Thou the Beloved of the entire creation and the
Desire of the whole universe, from them whom Thou hast made to be the
manifestations of the Evil Whisperer, who whisper in men’s breasts. Potent
art Thou to do Thy pleasure. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Bless Thou, O Lord my God, Him Whom Thou hast set over Thy most excellent
Titles, and through Whom Thou hast divided between the godly and the
wicked, and graciously aid us to do what Thou lovest and desirest. Bless
Thou, moreover, O my God, them Who are Thy Words and Thy Letters, and them
who have set their faces towards Thee, and turned unto Thy face, and
hearkened to Thy Call.

Thou art, truly, the Lord and King of all men, and art potent over all
things.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and...”


I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and it becometh him that seeketh
that shelter to abide within the Sanctuary of Thy protection and the
Stronghold of Thy defense. Illumine my inner being, O my Lord, with the
splendors of the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, even as Thou didst illumine
my outer being with the morning light of Thy favor.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“I have risen this morning by Thy grace, O my...”


I have risen this morning by Thy grace, O my God, and left my home
trusting wholly in Thee, and committing myself to Thy care. Send down,
then, upon me, out of the heaven of Thy mercy, a blessing from Thy side,
and enable me to return home in safety even as Thou didst enable me to set
out under Thy protection with my thoughts fixed steadfastly upon Thee.

There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast...”


I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast awakened me out of my
sleep, and brought me forth after my disappearance, and raised me up from
my slumber. I have wakened this morning with my face set toward the
splendors of the Daystar of Thy Revelation, through Which the heavens of
Thy power and Thy majesty have been illumined, acknowledging Thy signs,
believing in Thy Book, and holding fast unto Thy Cord.

I beseech Thee, by the potency of Thy will and the compelling power of Thy
purpose, to make of what Thou didst reveal unto me in my sleep the surest
foundation for the mansions of Thy love that are within the hearts of Thy
loved ones, and the best instrument for the revelation of the tokens of
Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness.

Do Thou ordain for me through Thy most exalted Pen, O my Lord, the good of
this world and of the next. I testify that within Thy grasp are held the
reins of all things. Thou changest them as Thou pleasest. No God is there
save Thee, the Strong, the Faithful.

Thou art He Who changeth through His bidding abasement into glory, and
weakness into strength, and powerlessness into might, and fear into calm,
and doubt into certainty. No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the
Beneficent.

Thou disappointest no one who hath sought Thee, nor dost Thou keep back
from Thee anyone who hath desired Thee. Ordain Thou for me what becometh
the heaven of Thy generosity, and the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art,
verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

—Bahá’u’lláh




PRAISE AND GRATITUDE



“All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the...”


All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the Source of all glory and
majesty, of greatness and honor, of sovereignty and dominion, of loftiness
and grace, of awe and power. Whomsoever Thou willest Thou causest to draw
nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, and on whomsoever Thou desirest Thou
conferrest the honor of recognizing Thy Most Ancient Name. Of all who are
in heaven and on earth, none can withstand the operation of Thy sovereign
Will. From all eternity Thou didst rule the entire creation, and Thou wilt
continue for evermore to exercise Thy dominion over all created things.
There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, The Most Exalted, the
All-Powerful, the All-Wise.

Illumine, O Lord, the faces of Thy servants, that they may behold Thee;
and cleanse their hearts that they may turn unto the court of Thy heavenly
favors, and recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self and the
Dayspring of Thine Essence. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds. There
is no God but Thee, the Unconstrained, the All-Subduing.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“In the Name of God, the Most High! Lauded...”


In the Name of God, the Most High! Lauded and glorified art Thou, Lord,
God Omnipotent! Thou before Whose wisdom the wise falleth short and
faileth, before Whose knowledge the learned confesseth his ignorance,
before Whose might the strong waxeth weak, before Whose wealth the rich
testifieth to his poverty, before Whose light the enlightened is lost in
darkness, toward the shrine of Whose knowledge turneth the essence of all
understanding and around the sanctuary of Whose presence circle the souls
of all mankind.

How then can I sing and tell of Thine Essence, which the wisdom of the
wise and the learning of the learned have failed to comprehend, inasmuch
as no man can sing that which he understandeth not, nor recount that unto
which he cannot attain, whilst Thou hast been from everlasting the
Inaccessible, the Unsearchable. Powerless though I be to rise to the
heavens of Thy glory and soar in the realms of Thy knowledge, I can but
recount Thy tokens that tell of Thy glorious handiwork.

By Thy Glory! O Beloved of all hearts, Thou that alone canst still the
pangs of yearning for Thee! Though all the dwellers of heaven and earth
unite to glorify the least of Thy signs, wherein and whereby Thou hast
revealed Thyself, yet would they fail, how much more to praise Thy holy
Word, the creator of all Thy tokens.

All praise and glory be to Thee, Thou of Whom all things have testified
that Thou art one and there is none other God but Thee, Who hast been from
everlasting exalted above all peer or likeness and to everlasting shalt
remain the same. All kings are but Thy servants and all beings, visible
and invisible, as naught before Thee. There is none other God but Thee,
the Gracious, the Powerful, the Most High.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God!...”


Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou art He Whom all things worship
and Who worshipeth no one, Who is the Lord of all things and is the vassal
of none, Who knoweth all things and is known of none. Thou didst wish to
make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy
mouth, bring creation into being and fashion the universe. There is none
other God except Thee, the Fashioner, the Creator, the Almighty, the Most
Powerful.

I implore Thee, by this very word that hath shone forth above the horizon
of Thy will, to enable me to drink deep of the living waters through which
Thou hast vivified the hearts of Thy chosen ones and quickened the souls
of them that love Thee, that I may, at all times and under all conditions,
turn my face wholly towards Thee.

Thou art the God of power, of glory and bounty. No God is there beside
Thee, the Supreme Ruler, the All-Glorious, the Omniscient.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I yield...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I yield Thee thanks for having enabled
me to recognize the Manifestation of Thyself, and for having severed me
from Thine enemies, and laid bare before mine eyes their misdeeds and
wicked works in Thy days, and for having rid me of all attachment to them,
and caused me to turn wholly towards Thy grace and bountiful favors. I
give Thee thanks, also, for having sent down upon me from the clouds of
Thy will that which hath so sanctified me from the hints of the infidels
and the allusions of the misbelievers that I have fixed my heart firmly on
Thee, and fled from such as have denied the light of Thy countenance.
Again I thank Thee for having empowered me to be steadfast in Thy love,
and to speak forth Thy praise and to extol Thy virtues, and for having
given me to drink of the cup of Thy mercy that hath surpassed all things
visible and invisible.

Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-
Loving.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time...”


Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I attempt to make mention of
Thee, I am hindered by the sublimity of Thy station and the overpowering
greatness of Thy might. For were I to praise Thee throughout the length of
Thy dominion and the duration of Thy sovereignty, I would find that my
praise of Thee can befit only such as are like unto me, who are themselves
Thy creatures, and who have been generated through the power of Thy decree
and been fashioned through the potency of Thy will. And at whatever time
my pen ascribeth glory to any one of Thy names, methinks I can hear the
voice of its lamentation in its remoteness from Thee, and can recognize
its cry because of its separation from Thy Self. I testify that everything
other than Thee is but Thy creation and is held in the hollow of Thy hand.
To have accepted any act or praise from Thy creatures is but an evidence
of the wonders of Thy grace and bountiful favors, and a manifestation of
Thy generosity and providence.

I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Great Name whereby Thou didst
separate light from fire, and truth from denial, to send down upon me and
upon such of my loved ones as are in my company the good of this world and
of the next. Supply us, then, with Thy wondrous gifts that are hid from
the eyes of men. Thou art, verily, the Fashioner of all creation. No God
is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most High.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion...”


All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion and light and grandeur
and splendor be unto Thee. Thou bestowest sovereignty on whom Thou willest
and dost withhold it from whom Thou desirest. No God is there but Thee,
the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. Thou art He Who createth from naught
the universe and all that dwell therein. There is nothing worthy of Thee
except Thyself, while all else but Thee are as outcasts in Thy holy
presence and are as nothing when compared to the glory of Thine Own Being.

Far be it from me to extol Thy virtues save by what Thou hast extolled
Thyself in Thy weighty Book where Thou sayest, “No vision taketh in Him,
but He taketh in all vision. He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.”(6)
Glory be unto Thee, O my God, indeed no mind or vision, however keen or
discriminating, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of Thy
signs. Verily, Thou art God, no God is there besides Thee. I bear witness
that Thou Thyself alone art the sole expression of Thine attributes, that
the praise of no one besides Thee can ever attain to Thy holy court nor
can Thine attributes ever be fathomed by anyone other than Thyself.

Glory be unto Thee, Thou art exalted above the description of anyone save
Thyself, since it is beyond human conception to befittingly magnify Thy
virtues or to comprehend the inmost reality of Thine Essence. Far be it
from Thy glory that Thy creatures should describe Thee or that anyone
besides Thyself should ever know Thee. I have known Thee, O my God, by
reason of Thy making Thyself known unto me, for hadst Thou not revealed
Thyself unto me, I would not have known Thee. I worship Thee by virtue of
Thy summoning me unto Thee, for had it not been for Thy summons I would
not have worshiped Thee.

PROTECTION



“Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest...”


Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest and knowest that I have
called upon Thy servants to turn nowhere except in the direction of Thy
bestowals, and have bidden them observe naught save the things Thou didst
prescribe in Thy Perspicuous Book, the Book which hath been sent down
according to Thine inscrutable decree and irrevocable purpose.

I can utter no word, O my God, unless I be permitted by Thee, and can move
in no direction until I obtain Thy sanction. It is Thou, O my God, Who
hast called me into being through the power of Thy might, and hast endued
me with Thy grace to manifest Thy Cause. Wherefore I have been subjected
to such adversities that my tongue hath been hindered from extolling Thee
and from magnifying Thy glory.

All praise be to Thee, O my God, for the things Thou didst ordain for me
through Thy decree and by the power of Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee
that Thou wilt fortify both myself and them that love me in our love for
Thee, and wilt keep us firm in Thy Cause. I swear by Thy might! O my God!
Thy servant’s shame is to be shut out as by a veil from Thee, and his
glory is to know Thee. Armed with the power of Thy name nothing can ever
hurt me, and with Thy love in my heart all the world’s afflictions can in
no wise alarm me.

Send down, therefore, O my Lord, upon me and upon my loved ones that which
will protect us from the mischief of those that have repudiated Thy truth
and disbelieved in Thy signs.

Thou art, verily, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy...”


Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy servant who hath quaffed from
the hands of Thy grace the wine of Thy tender mercy, and tasted of the
savor of Thy love in Thy days. I beseech Thee, by the embodiments of Thy
names whom no grief can hinder from rejoicing in Thy love or from gazing
on Thy face, and whom all the hosts of the heedless are powerless to cause
to turn aside from the path of Thy pleasure, to supply him with the good
things Thou dost possess, and to raise him up to such heights that he will
regard the world even as a shadow that vanisheth swifter than the
twinkling of an eye.

Keep him safe also, O my God, by the power of Thine immeasurable majesty,
from all that Thou abhorrest. Thou art, verily, his Lord and the Lord of
all worlds.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I entreat...”


Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I entreat Thee by Thy Name through
which the Hour hath struck, and the Resurrection came to pass, and fear
and trembling seized all that are in heaven and all that are on earth, to
rain down, out of the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy tender
compassion, what will gladden the hearts of Thy servants, who have turned
towards Thee and helped Thy Cause.

Keep safe Thy servants and Thy handmaidens, O my Lord, from the darts of
idle fancy and vain imaginings, and give them from the hands of Thy grace
a draught of the soft-flowing waters of Thy knowledge.

Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the
Most Generous.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O God, my God! I have set out from my...”


O God, my God! I have set out from my home, holding fast unto the cord of
Thy love, and I have committed myself wholly to Thy care and Thy
protection. I entreat Thee by Thy power through which Thou didst protect
Thy loved ones from the wayward and the perverse, and from every
contumacious oppressor, and every wicked doer who hath strayed far from
Thee, to keep me safe by Thy bounty and Thy grace. Enable me, then, to
return to my home by Thy power and Thy might. Thou art, truly, the
Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Ordain for me, O my Lord, and for those who...”


Ordain for me, O my Lord, and for those who believe in Thee that which is
deemed best for us in Thine estimation, as set forth in the Mother Book,
for within the grasp of Thy hand Thou holdest the determined measures of
all things.

Thy goodly gifts are unceasingly showered upon such as cherish Thy love,
and the wondrous tokens of Thy heavenly bounties are amply bestowed on
those who recognize Thy divine Unity. We commit unto Thy care whatsoever
Thou hast destined for us, and implore Thee to grant us all the good that
Thy knowledge embraceth.

Protect me, O my Lord, from every evil that Thine omniscience perceiveth,
inasmuch as there is no power nor strength but in Thee, no triumph is
forthcoming save from Thy presence, and it is Thine alone to command.
Whatever God hath willed hath been, and that which He hath not willed
shall not be.

There is no power nor strength except in God, the Most Exalted, the Most
Mighty.

“Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou art the God...”


Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou art the God Who hath existed before all
things, Who will exist after all things and will last beyond all things.
Thou art the God Who knoweth all things, and is supreme over all things.
Thou art the God Who dealeth mercifully with all things, Who judgeth
between all things and Whose vision embraceth all things. Thou art God my
Lord, Thou art aware of my position, Thou dost witness my inner and outer
being.

Grant Thy forgiveness unto me and unto the believers who responded to Thy
Call. Be Thou my sufficing helper against the mischief of whosoever may
desire to inflict sorrow upon me or wish me ill. Verily, Thou art the Lord
of all created things. Thou dost suffice everyone, while no one can be
self-sufficient without Thee.

“In the Name of God, the Lord of overpowering...”


In the Name of God, the Lord of overpowering majesty, the All-Compelling.

Hallowed be the Lord in Whose hand is the source of dominion. He createth
whatsoever He willeth by His Word of command “Be,” and it is. His hath
been the power of authority heretofore, and it shall remain His hereafter.
He maketh victorious whomsoever He pleaseth, through the potency of His
behest. He is in truth the Powerful, the Almighty. Unto Him pertaineth all
glory and majesty in the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation and whatever
lieth between them. Verily, He is the Potent, the All-Glorious. From
everlasting He hath been the Source of indomitable strength and shall
remain so unto everlasting. He is indeed the Lord of might and power. All
the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatever is between them are God’s,
and His power is supreme over all things. All the treasures of earth and
heaven and everything between them are His, and His protection extendeth
over all things. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and
whatever lieth between them, and He truly is a witness over all things. He
is the Lord of Reckoning for all that dwell in the heavens and on earth
and whatever lieth between them, and truly God is swift to reckon. He
setteth the measure assigned to all who are in the heavens and the earth
and whatever is between them. Verily, He is the Supreme Protector. He
holdeth in His grasp the keys of heaven and earth and of everything
between them. At His Own pleasure doth He bestow gifts, through the power
of His command. Indeed His grace encompasseth all, and He is the
All-Knowing.

Say: God sufficeth unto me; He is the One Who holdeth in His grasp the
kingdom of all things. Through the power of His hosts of heaven and earth
and whatever lieth between them, He protecteth whomsoever among His
servants He willeth. God, in truth, keepeth watch over all things.

Immeasurably exalted art Thou, O Lord! Protect us from what lieth in front
of us and behind us, above our heads, on our right, on our left, below our
feet and every other side to which we are exposed. Verily, Thy protection
over all things is unfailing.(7)

“O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants...”


O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and
passion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving-kindness from
all rancor, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of
Thy care and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the
manifestations of Thy glorious signs, illumine their faces with the
effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy divine unity, gladden their
hearts with the verses revealed from Thy holy kingdom, strengthen their
loins by Thine all-swaying power that cometh from Thy realm of glory. Thou
art the All-Bountiful, the Protector, the Almighty, the Gracious.

“O my Lord! Thou knowest that the people...”


O my Lord! Thou knowest that the people are encircled with pain and
calamities and are environed with hardships and trouble. Every trial doth
attack man and every dire adversity doth assail him like unto the assault
of a serpent. There is no shelter and asylum for him except under the wing
of Thy protection, preservation, guard and custody.

O Thou the Merciful One! O my Lord! Make Thy protection my armor, Thy
preservation my shield, humbleness before the door of Thy oneness my
guard, and Thy custody and defense my fortress and my abode. Preserve me
from the suggestions of self and desire, and guard me from every sickness,
trial, difficulty and ordeal.

Verily, Thou art the Protector, the Guardian, the Preserver, the Sufficer,
and verily, Thou art the Merciful of the Most Merciful.

“O God, my God! We are servants of Thine...”


Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer with a heart
throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from all but His
remembrance, that the All-Powerful may graciously aid you to achieve
supreme victory.

O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that have turned with devotion to
Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all besides Thee in this
glorious Day. We have gathered in this Spiritual Assembly, united in our
views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst
mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the
Standards of Thine exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty
Covenant, O Thou our Lord Most High, manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in
Thine Abhá Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord!
Aid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace,
streams flowing from Thine all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the
Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty
in Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses
of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace,
that we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together
as the rays of Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our
feelings may become as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union
throughout the world. Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower,
the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our...”


Come ye together in gladness unalloyed, and at the beginning of the
meeting, recite ye this prayer:

O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our bodies be gathered here together,
yet our spellbound hearts are carried away by Thy love, and yet are we
transported by the rays of Thy resplendent face. Weak though we be, we
await the revelations of Thy might and power. Poor though we be, with
neither goods nor means, still take we riches from the treasures of Thy
Kingdom. Drops though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean deeps.
Motes though we be, still do we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.

O Thou our Provider! Send down Thine aid, that each one gathered here may
become a lighted candle, each one a center of attraction, each one a
summoner to Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether world
the mirror image of Thy Paradise.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God! O God! From the unseen kingdom of...”


Prayer to be said at the close of the meeting of the Spiritual Assembly.

O God! O God! From the unseen kingdom of Thy oneness behold us assembled
in this spiritual meeting, believing in Thee, confident in Thy signs, firm
in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted to Thee, set aglow with the fire
of Thy love and sincere in Thy Cause. We are servants in Thy vineyard,
spreaders of Thy religion, devoted worshipers of Thy countenance, humble
towards Thy loved ones, submissive before Thy door, and imploring Thee to
confirm us in serving Thy chosen ones, to support us with Thine unseen
hosts, to strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and to make us submissive
and adoring subjects communing with Thee.

O our Lord! We are weak, and Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful. We are
lifeless, and Thou art the great life-giving Spirit. We are needy, and
Thou art the Sustainer, the Powerful.

O our Lord! Turn our faces unto Thy merciful countenance, feed us from Thy
heavenly table with Thine abundant grace, assist us with the hosts of Thy
supreme angels and confirm us through the holy ones of the Kingdom of
Abhá.

Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Merciful. Thou art the Possessor of
great bounty, and, verily, Thou art the Clement and the Gracious.

SPIRITUAL QUALITIES



“From the sweet-scented streams of Thine eternity...”


From the sweet-scented streams of Thine eternity give me to drink, O my
God, and of the fruits of the tree of Thy being enable me to taste, O my
Hope! From the crystal springs of Thy love suffer me to quaff, O my Glory,
and beneath the shadow of Thine everlasting providence let me abide, O my
Light! Within the meadows of Thy nearness, before Thy presence, make me
able to roam, O my Beloved, and at the right hand of the throne of Thy
mercy, seat me, O my Desire! From the fragrant breezes of Thy joy let a
breath pass over me, O my Goal, and into the heights of the paradise of
Thy reality let me gain admission, O my Adored One! To the melodies of the
dove of Thy oneness suffer me to hearken, O Resplendent One, and through
the spirit of Thy power and Thy might quicken me, O my Provider! In the
spirit of Thy love keep me steadfast, O my Succorer, and in the path of
Thy good pleasure set firm my steps, O my Maker! Within the garden of
Thine immortality, before Thy countenance, let me abide for ever, O Thou
Who art merciful unto me, and upon the seat of Thy glory stablish me, O
Thou Who art my Possessor! To the heaven of Thy loving-kindness lift me
up, O my Quickener, and unto the Daystar of Thy guidance lead me, O Thou
my Attractor! Before the revelations of Thine invisible spirit summon me
to be present, O Thou Who art my Origin and my Highest Wish, and unto the
essence of the fragrance of Thy beauty, which Thou wilt manifest, cause me
to return, O Thou Who art my God!

Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Most
Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Highest.

“Create in me a pure heart, O my God, and renew...”


Create in me a pure heart, O my God, and renew a tranquil conscience
within me, O my Hope! Through the spirit of power confirm Thou me in Thy
Cause, O my Best-Beloved, and by the light of Thy glory reveal unto me Thy
path, O Thou the Goal of my desire! Through the power of Thy transcendent
might lift me up unto the heaven of Thy holiness, O Source of my being,
and by the breezes of Thine eternity gladden me, O Thou Who art my God!
Let Thine everlasting melodies breathe tranquillity on me, O my Companion,
and let the riches of Thine ancient countenance deliver me from all except
Thee, O my Master, and let the tidings of the revelation of Thine
incorruptible Essence bring me joy, O Thou Who art the most manifest of
the manifest and the most hidden of the hidden!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful!...”


He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful!

O God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, and the voice of Thy Pen of
Glory awakened me. The stream of Thy holy utterance hath enraptured me,
and the wine of Thine inspiration entranced me. Thou seest me, O Lord,
detached from all things but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and
craving the wonders of Thy grace. I ask Thee, by the eternal billows of
Thy loving-kindness and the shining lights of Thy tender care and favor,
to grant that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and make me rich in Thy
wealth. My tongue, my pen, my whole being, testify to Thy power, Thy
might, Thy grace and Thy bounty, that Thou art God and there is none other
God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty.

I bear witness at this moment, O my God, to my helplessness and Thy
sovereignty, my feebleness and Thy power. I know not that which profiteth
me or harmeth me; Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Do Thou
decree for me, O Lord, my God, and my Master, that which will make me feel
content with Thine eternal decree and will prosper me in every world of
Thine. Thou art in truth the Gracious, the Bountiful.

Lord! Turn me not away from the ocean of Thy wealth and the heaven of Thy
mercy, and ordain for me the good of this world and hereafter. Verily,
Thou art the Lord of the mercy-seat, enthroned in the highest; there is
none other God but Thee, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O my Lord! Make Thy beauty to be my food,...”


O my Lord! Make Thy beauty to be my food, and Thy presence my drink, and
Thy pleasure my hope, and praise of Thee my action, and remembrance of
Thee my companion, and the power of Thy sovereignty my succorer, and Thy
habitation my home, and my dwelling-place the seat Thou hast sanctified
from the limitations imposed upon them who are shut out as by a veil from
Thee.

Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I am...”


Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I am Thy servant who hath laid hold on
the cord of Thy tender mercies, and clung to the hem of Thy bounteousness.
I entreat Thee by Thy name whereby Thou hast subjected all created things,
both visible and invisible, and through which the breath that is life
indeed was wafted over the entire creation, to strengthen me by Thy power
which hath encompassed the heavens and the earth, and to guard me from all
sickness and tribulation. I bear witness that Thou art the Lord of all
names, and the Ordainer of all that may please Thee. There is none other
God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, what will profit me in every world of
Thy worlds. Supply me, then, with what Thou hast written down for the
chosen ones among Thy creatures, whom neither the blame of the blamer, nor
the clamor of the infidel, nor the estrangement of such as have withdrawn
from Thee, hath deterred from turning towards Thee.

Thou, truly, art the Help in Peril through the power of Thy sovereignty.
No God is there save Thee, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O my God, the God of bounty and mercy!...”


O my God, the God of bounty and mercy!

Thou art that King by Whose commanding word the whole creation hath been
called into being; and Thou art that All-Bountiful One the doings of Whose
servants have never hindered Him from showing forth His grace, nor have
they frustrated the revelations of His bounty.

Suffer this servant, I beseech Thee, to attain unto that which is the
cause of his salvation in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the
Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“He is the prayer-hearing, prayer-answering...”


He is the prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God!

By Thy glory, O Beloved One, Thou giver of light to the world! The flames
of separation have consumed me, and my waywardness hath melted my heart
within me. I ask of Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, O Thou the Desire of the
world and the Well-Beloved of mankind, to grant that the breeze of Thine
inspiration may sustain my soul, that Thy wondrous voice may reach my ear,
that my eyes may behold Thy signs and Thy light as revealed in the
manifestations of Thy names and Thine attributes, O Thou within Whose
grasp are all things!

Thou seest, O Lord my God, the tears of Thy favored ones, shed because of
their separation from Thee, and the fears of Thy devoted ones in their
remoteness from Thy Holy Court. By Thy power, that swayeth all things,
visible and invisible! It behooveth Thy loved ones to shed tears of blood
for that which hath befallen the faithful at the hands of the wicked and
the oppressors on the earth. Thou beholdest, O my God, how the ungodly
have compassed Thy cities and Thy realms! I ask Thee by Thy Messengers and
Thy chosen ones and by Him whereby the standard of Thy divine unity hath
been implanted amidst Thy servants, to shield them by Thy bounty. Thou
art, verily, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful.

And, again, I ask Thee by the sweet showers of Thy grace and the billows
of the ocean of Thy favor, to ordain for Thy saints that which shall
solace their eyes and comfort their hearts. Lord! Thou seest him that
kneeleth yearning to arise and serve Thee, the dead calling for eternal
life from the ocean of Thy favor and craving to soar to the heavens of Thy
wealth, the stranger longing for his home of glory ‘neath the canopy of
Thy grace, the seeker hastening by Thy mercy to Thy door of bounty, the
sinful turning to the ocean of forgiveness and pardon.

By Thy sovereignty, O Thou Who art glorified in the hearts of men! I have
turned to Thee, forsaking mine own will and desire, that Thy holy will and
pleasure may rule within me and direct me according to that which the pen
of Thy eternal decree hath destined for me. This servant, O Lord, though
helpless turneth to the Orb of Thy Power, though abased hasteneth unto the
Dayspring of Glory, though needy craveth the Ocean of Thy Grace. I beseech
Thee by Thy favor and bounty, cast him not away.

Thou art verily the Almighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I give...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I give Thee thanks inasmuch as Thou
hast called me into being in Thy days, and infused into me Thy love and
Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, by Thy name whereby the goodly pearls of
Thy wisdom and Thine utterance were brought forth out of the treasuries of
the hearts of such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee, and through
which the Daystar of Thy name, the Compassionate, hath shed its radiance
upon all that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, to supply me, by Thy
grace and bounty, with Thy wondrous and hidden bounties.

These are the earliest days of my life, O my God, which Thou hast linked
with Thine own days. Now that Thou hast conferred upon me so great an
honor, withhold not from me the things Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen
ones.

I am, O my God, but a tiny seed which Thou hast sown in the soil of Thy
love, and caused to spring forth by the hand of Thy bounty. This seed
craveth, therefore, in its inmost being, for the waters of Thy mercy and
the living fountain of Thy grace. Send down upon it, from the heaven of
Thy loving-kindness, that which will enable it to flourish beneath Thy
shadow and within the borders of Thy court. Thou art He Who watereth the
hearts of all that have recognized Thee from Thy plenteous stream and the
fountain of Thy living waters.

Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Vouchsafe unto me, O my God, the full measure...”


Vouchsafe unto me, O my God, the full measure of Thy love and Thy
good-pleasure, and through the attractions of Thy resplendent light
enrapture our hearts, O Thou Who art the Supreme Evidence and the
All-Glorified. Send down upon me, as a token of Thy grace, Thy vitalizing
breezes, throughout the daytime and in the night season, O Lord of bounty.

No deed have I done, O my God, to merit beholding Thy face, and I know of
a certainty that were I to live as long as the world lasts I would fail to
accomplish any deed such as to deserve this favor, inasmuch as the station
of a servant shall ever fall short of access to Thy holy precincts, unless
Thy bounty should reach me and Thy tender mercy pervade me and Thy
loving-kindness encompass me.

All praise be unto Thee, O Thou besides Whom there is none other God.
Graciously enable me to ascend unto Thee, to be granted the honor of
dwelling in Thy nearness and to have communion with Thee alone. No God is
there but Thee.

Indeed shouldst Thou desire to confer blessing upon a servant Thou wouldst
blot out from the realm of his heart every mention or disposition except
Thine Own mention; and shouldst Thou ordain evil for a servant by reason
of that which his hands have unjustly wrought before Thy face, Thou
wouldst test him with the benefits of this world and of the next that he
might become preoccupied therewith and forget Thy remembrance.

“O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify...”


O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify my heart. Illumine my powers.
I lay all my affairs in Thy hand. Thou art my Guide and my Refuge. I will
no longer be sorrowful and grieved; I will be a happy and joyful being. O
God! I will no longer be full of anxiety, nor will I let trouble harass
me. I will not dwell on the unpleasant things of life.

O God! Thou art more friend to me than I am to myself. I dedicate myself
to Thee, O Lord.

“O my God! O my God! Glory be unto Thee...”


O my God! O my God! Glory be unto Thee for that Thou hast confirmed me to
the confession of Thy oneness, attracted me unto the word of Thy
singleness, enkindled me by the fire of Thy love, and occupied me with Thy
mention and the service of Thy friends and maidservants.

O Lord, help me to be meek and lowly, and strengthen me in severing myself
from all things and in holding to the hem of the garment of Thy glory, so
that my heart may be filled with Thy love and leave no space for love of
the world and attachment to its qualities.

O God! Sanctify me from all else save Thee, purge me from the dross of
sins and transgressions, and cause me to possess a spiritual heart and
conscience.

Verily, Thou art merciful and, verily, Thou art the Most Generous, Whose
help is sought by all men.

“O my Lord! O my Lord! This is a lamp lighted...”


O my Lord! O my Lord! This is a lamp lighted by the fire of Thy love and
ablaze with the flame which is ignited in the tree of Thy mercy. O my
Lord! Increase his enkindlement, heat and flame, with the fire which is
kindled in the Sinai of Thy Manifestation. Verily, Thou art the Confirmer,
the Assister, the Powerful, the Generous, the Loving.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O my God! O my God! This, Thy servant,...”


O my God! O my God! This, Thy servant, hath advanced towards Thee, is
passionately wandering in the desert of Thy love, walking in the path of
Thy service, anticipating Thy favors, hoping for Thy bounty, relying upon
Thy kingdom, and intoxicated by the wine of Thy gift. O my God! Increase
the fervor of his affection for Thee, the constancy of his praise of Thee,
and the ardor of his love for Thee.

Verily, Thou art the Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding. There is
no other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant,...”


O God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant, Thy spiritual thrall, who hath
drawn nigh unto Thee and approached Thy presence. He hath turned his face
unto Thine, acknowledging Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, and he
hath called out in Thy name among the nations, and led the people to the
streaming waters of Thy mercy, O Thou Most generous Lord! To those who
asked He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance that brimmeth over
with the wine of Thy measureless grace.

O Lord, assist him under all conditions, cause him to learn Thy
well-guarded mysteries, and shower down upon him Thy hidden pearls. Make
of him a banner rippling from castle summits in the winds of Thy heavenly
aid, make of him a wellspring of crystal waters.

O my forgiving Lord! Light up the hearts with the rays of a lamp that
sheddeth abroad its beams, disclosing to those among Thy people whom Thou
hast bounteously favored, the realities of all things.

Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Protector, the Strong, the
Beneficent! Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mercies!

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants;...”


O God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants; they are Thy loyal bondsmen
and Thy handmaidens, who have bowed themselves down before Thine exalted
Utterance and humbled themselves at Thy Threshold of light, and borne
witness to Thy oneness through which the Sun hath been made to shine in
midday splendor. They have listened to the summons Thou didst raise from
out Thy hidden Realm, and with hearts quivering with love and rapture,
they have responded to Thy call.

O Lord, shower upon them all the outpourings of Thy mercy, rain down upon
them all the waters of Thy grace. Make them to grow as beauteous plants in
the garden of heaven, and from the full and brimming clouds of Thy
bestowals and out of the deep pools of Thine abounding grace make Thou
this garden to flower, and keep it ever green and lustrous, ever fresh and
shimmering and fair.

Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, He Who alone, in
the heavens and on the earth, abideth unchanged. There is none other God
save Thee, the Lord of manifest tokens and signs.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“He is God!...”


He is God!

O God, my God! These are servants attracted in Thy days by the fragrances
of Thy holiness, enkindled with the flame burning in Thy holy tree,
responding to Thy voice, uttering Thy praise, awakened by Thy breeze,
stirred by Thy sweet savors, beholding Thy signs, understanding Thy
verses, hearkening to Thy words, believing Thy Revelation and assured of
Thy loving-kindness. Their eyes, O Lord, are fixed upon Thy kingdom of
effulgent glory and their faces turned toward Thy dominion on high, their
hearts beating with the love of Thy radiant and glorious beauty, their
souls consumed with the flame of Thy love, O Lord of this world and the
world hereafter, their lives seething with the ardor of their longing for
Thee, and their tears poured forth for Thy sake.

Shield them within the stronghold of Thy protection and safety, preserve
them in Thy watchful care, look upon them with the eyes of Thy providence
and mercy, make them the signs of Thy divine unity that are manifest
throughout all regions, the standards of Thy might that wave above Thy
mansions of grandeur, the shining lamps that burn with the oil of Thy
wisdom in the globes of Thy guidance, the birds of the garden of Thy
knowledge that warble upon the topmost boughs in Thy sheltering paradise,
and the leviathans of the ocean of Thy bounty that plunge by Thy supreme
mercy in the fathomless deeps.

O Lord, my God! Lowly are these servants of Thine, exalt them in Thy
kingdom on high; feeble, strengthen them by Thy supreme power; abased,
bestow upon them Thy glory in Thine all-highest realm; poor, enrich them
in Thy great dominion. Do Thou then ordain for them all the good Thou hast
destined in Thy worlds, visible and invisible, prosper them in this world
below, gladden their hearts with Thine inspiration, O Lord of all beings!
Illumine their hearts with Thy joyful tidings diffused from Thine
all-glorious Station, make firm their steps in Thy Most Great Covenant and
strengthen their loins in Thy firm Testament, by Thy bounty and promised
grace, O Gracious and Merciful One! Thou art, verily, the Gracious, the
All-Bountiful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over...”


O Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over the friends in the West the sweet
fragrance of the Holy Spirit, and with the light of divine guidance Thou
hast lit up the western sky. Thou hast made those who were once remote to
draw near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into loving friends;
Thou hast awakened those who slept; Thou hast made the heedless mindful.

O Thou Provider! Assist Thou these noble friends to win Thy good pleasure,
and make them well wishers of stranger and friend alike. Bring them into
the world that abideth forever; grant them a portion of heavenly grace;
cause them to be true Bahá’ís, sincerely of God; save them from outward
semblances, and establish them firmly in the truth. Make them signs and
tokens of the Kingdom, luminous stars above the horizons of this nether
life. Make them to be a comfort and a solace to humankind and servants to
the peace of the world. Exhilarate them with the wine of Thy counsel, and
grant that all of them may tread the path of Thy commandments.

O Thou Provider! The dearest wish of this servant of Thy Threshold is to
behold the friends of East and West in close embrace; to see all the
members of human society gathered with love in a single great assemblage,
even as individual drops of water collected in one mighty sea; to behold
them all as birds in one garden of roses, as pearls of one ocean, as
leaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.

Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art the God of strength, the
Omnipotent, the All-Seeing.

STEADFASTNESS



“Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech...”


Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy power that
hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy Sovereignty that hath
transcended the entire creation, and by Thy Word which was hidden in Thy
wisdom and whereby Thou didst create Thy heaven and Thy earth, both to
enable us to be steadfast in our love for Thee and in our obedience to Thy
pleasure, and to fix our gaze upon Thy face, and celebrate Thy glory.
Empower us, then, O my God, to spread abroad Thy signs among Thy
creatures, and to guard Thy Faith in Thy realm. Thou hast ever existed
independently of the mention of any of Thy creatures, and wilt remain as
Thou hast been for ever and ever.

In Thee I have placed my whole confidence, unto Thee I have turned my
face, to the cord of Thy loving providence I have clung, and towards the
shadow of Thy mercy I have hastened. Cast me not as one disappointed out
of Thy door, O my God, and withhold not from me Thy grace, for Thee alone
do I seek. No God is there beside Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most
Bountiful.

Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of them that have known
Thee!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O Thou Whose nearness is my wish, Whose...”


O Thou Whose nearness is my wish, Whose presence is my hope, Whose
remembrance is my desire, Whose court of glory is my goal, Whose abode is
my aim, Whose name is my healing, Whose love is the radiance of my heart,
Whose service is my highest aspiration! I beseech Thee by Thy Name,
through which Thou hast enabled them that have recognized Thee to soar to
the sublimest heights of the knowledge of Thee and empowered such as
devoutly worship Thee to ascend into the precincts of the court of Thy
holy favors, to aid me to turn my face towards Thy face, to fix mine eyes
upon Thee, and to speak of Thy glory.

I am the one, O my Lord, who hath forgotten all else but Thee, and turned
towards the Dayspring of Thy grace, who hath forsaken all save Thyself in
the hope of drawing nigh unto Thy court. Behold me, then, with mine eyes
lifted up towards the Seat that shineth with the splendors of the light of
Thy Face. Send down, then, upon me, O my Beloved, that which will enable
me to be steadfast in Thy Cause, so that the doubts of the infidels may
not hinder me from turning towards Thee.

Thou art, verily, the God of Power, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious,
the Almighty.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O God, my God! I have turned in repentance...”


O God, my God! I have turned in repentance unto Thee, and verily Thou art
the Pardoner, the Compassionate.

O God, my God! I have returned to Thee, and verily Thou art the
Ever-Forgiving, the Gracious.

O God, my God! I have clung to the cord of Thy bounty, and with Thee is
the storehouse of all that is in heaven and earth.

O God, my God! I have hastened toward Thee, and verily Thou art the
Forgiver, the Lord of grace abounding.

O God, my God! I thirst for the celestial wine of Thy grace, and verily
Thou art the Giver, the Bountiful, the Gracious, the Almighty.

O God, my God! I testify that Thou hast revealed Thy Cause, fulfilled Thy
promise and sent down from the heaven of Thy grace that which hath drawn
unto Thee the hearts of Thy favored ones. Well is it with him that hath
held fast unto Thy firm cord and clung to the hem of Thy resplendent robe!

I ask Thee, O Lord of all being and King of the seen and unseen, by Thy
power, Thy majesty and Thy sovereignty, to grant that my name may be
recorded by Thy pen of glory among Thy devoted ones, them whom the scrolls
of the sinful hindered not from turning to the light of Thy countenance, O
prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God!

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thy Most
Great Name, Who hath been sorely afflicted by such of Thy creatures as
have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been hemmed in by sorrows which no
tongue can describe, to grant that I may remember Thee and celebrate Thy
praise, in these days when all have turned away from Thy beauty, have
disputed with Thee, and turned away disdainfully from Him Who is the
Revealer of Thy Cause. None is there, O my Lord, to help Thee except Thine
own Self, and no power to succor Thee save Thine own power.

I entreat Thee to enable me to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy
remembrance. This is, verily, within my power, and Thou art the One that
knoweth all that is in me. Thou, in truth, art knowing, apprised of all.
Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the splendors of the light of Thy face,
whose brightness hath illuminated the whole world. No God is there beside
Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praise be to Thee, O Lord, my Best Beloved!...”


Praise be to Thee, O Lord, my Best Beloved! Make me steadfast in Thy
Cause, and grant that I may be reckoned among those who have not violated
Thy Covenant nor followed the gods of their own idle fancy. Enable me,
then, to obtain a seat of truth in Thy presence, bestow upon me a token of
Thy mercy and let me join with such of Thy servants as shall have no fear
nor shall they be put to grief. Abandon me not to myself, O my Lord, nor
deprive me of recognizing Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Own Self,
nor account me with such as have turned away from Thy holy presence.
Number me, O my God, with those who are privileged to fix their gaze upon
Thy Beauty and who take such delight therein that they would not exchange
a single moment thereof with the sovereignty of the kingdom of heavens and
earth or with the entire realm of creation. Have mercy on me, O Lord, in
these days when the peoples of Thine earth have erred grievously; supply
me then, O my God, with that which is good and seemly in Thine estimation.
Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Gracious, the Bountiful, the
Ever-Forgiving.

Grant, O my God, that I may not be reckoned among those whose ears are
deaf, whose eyes are blind, whose tongues are speechless and whose hearts
have failed to comprehend. Deliver me, O Lord, from the fire of ignorance
and of selfish desire, suffer me to be admitted into the precincts of Thy
transcendent mercy and send down upon me that which Thou hast ordained for
Thy chosen ones. Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—The Báb



“Praised and glorified art Thou, O God! Grant...”


Praised and glorified art Thou, O God! Grant that the day of attaining Thy
holy presence may be fast approaching. Cheer our hearts through the
potency of Thy love and good-pleasure, and bestow upon us steadfastness
that we may willingly submit to Thy Will and Thy Decree. Verily, Thy
knowledge embraceth all the things Thou hast created or wilt create, and
Thy celestial might transcendeth whatsoever Thou hast called or wilt call
into being. There is none to be worshiped but Thee, there is none to be
desired except Thee, there is none to be adored besides Thee and there is
naught to be loved save Thy good-pleasure.

Verily, Thou art the supreme Ruler, the Sovereign Truth, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—The Báb



“O Lord my God! Assist Thy loved ones to be...”


O Lord my God! Assist Thy loved ones to be firm in Thy Faith, to walk in
Thy ways, to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Give them Thy grace to withstand
the onslaught of self and passion, to follow the light of divine guidance.
Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Self-Subsisting, the Bestower,
the Compassionate, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O Thou, my God! Who guidest the seeker to...”


O Thou, my God! Who guidest the seeker to the pathway that leadeth aright,
Who deliverest the lost and blinded soul out of the wastes of perdition,
Thou Who bestowest upon the sincere great bounties and favors, Who
guardest the frightened within Thine impregnable refuge, Who answerest,
from Thine all-highest horizon, the cry of those who cry out unto Thee.
Praised be Thou, O my Lord! Thou hast guided the distracted out of the
death of unbelief, and hast brought those who draw nigh unto Thee to the
journey’s goal, and hast rejoiced the assured among Thy servants by
granting them their most cherished desires, and hast, from Thy Kingdom of
beauty, opened before the faces of those who yearn after Thee the gates of
reunion, and hast rescued them from the fire of deprivation and loss—so
that they hastened unto Thee and gained Thy presence, and arrived at Thy
welcoming door, and received of gifts an abundant share.

O my Lord, they thirsted, Thou didst lift to their parched lips the waters
of reunion. O Tender One, Bestowing One, Thou didst calm their pain with
the balm of Thy bounty and grace, and didst heal their ailments with the
sovereign medicine of Thy compassion. O Lord, make firm their feet on Thy
straight path, make wide for them the needle’s eye, and cause them,
dressed in royal robes, to walk in glory for ever and ever.

Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Ever-Giving, the Precious, the Most
Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the
Exalted, the Victorious.

GENERAL PRAYERS FOR TEACHING



“Magnified be Thy name, O my God, for that...”


Magnified be Thy name, O my God, for that Thou hast manifested the Day
which is the King of Days, the Day which Thou didst announce unto Thy
chosen Ones and Thy Prophets in Thy most excellent Tablets, the Day
whereon Thou didst shed the splendor of the glory of all Thy names upon
all created things. Great is his blessedness whosoever hath set himself
towards Thee, and entered Thy presence, and caught the accents of Thy
voice.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the name of Him round Whom circleth in
adoration the kingdom of Thy names, that Thou wilt graciously assist them
that are dear to Thee to glorify Thy word among Thy servants, and to shed
abroad Thy praise amidst Thy creatures, so that the ecstasies of Thy
revelation may fill the souls of all the dwellers of Thine earth.

Since Thou hast guided them, O my Lord, unto the living waters of Thy
grace, grant, by Thy bounty, that they may not be kept back from Thee; and
since Thou hast summoned them to the habitation of Thy throne, drive them
not out from Thy presence, through Thy loving-kindness. Send down upon
them what shall wholly detach them from aught else except Thee, and make
them able to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, in such wise that
neither the ascendancy of the oppressor nor the suggestions of them that
have disbelieved in Thy most august and most mighty Self shall be capable
of keeping them back from Thee.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore...”


Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Name which none
hath befittingly recognized, and whose import no soul hath fathomed; I
beseech Thee, by Him Who is the Fountainhead of Thy Revelation and the
Dayspring of Thy signs, to make my heart to be a receptacle of Thy love
and of remembrance of Thee. Knit it, then, to Thy most great Ocean, that
from it may flow out the living waters of Thy wisdom and the crystal
streams of Thy glorification and praise.

The limbs of my body testify to Thy unity, and the hair of my head
declareth the power of Thy sovereignty and might. I have stood at the door
of Thy grace with utter self-effacement and complete abnegation, and clung
to the hem of Thy bounty, and fixed mine eyes upon the horizon of Thy
gifts.

Do Thou destine for me, O my God, what becometh the greatness of Thy
majesty, and assist me, by Thy strengthening grace, so to teach Thy Cause
that the dead may speed out of their sepulchers, and rush forth towards
Thee, trusting wholly in Thee, and fixing their gaze upon the orient of
Thy Cause, and the dawning-place of Thy Revelation.

Thou, verily, art the Most Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and...”


Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O Thou
Who hast become manifest in the Greatest Name, whereby the pearls of
wisdom and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great sea of Thy
knowledge, and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the
light of the appearance of the sun of Thy countenance.

I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among
Thy creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled amidst Thy servants, to
strengthen Thy people in that whereby the face of the Cause will radiate
in Thy dominion, the standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy
servants, and the banners of Thy guidance will be raised throughout Thy
dominions.

O my Lord! Thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of Thy grace and
holding fast unto the hem of the mantle of Thy beneficence. Ordain for
them that which may draw them nearer unto Thee, and withhold them from all
else save Thee.

I beg of Thee, O Thou King of existence and Protector of the seen and the
unseen, to make whosoever arises to serve Thy Cause as a sea moving by Thy
desire, as one ablaze with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, shining from the
horizon of the heaven of Thy will. Verily, Thou art the mighty One, Whom
neither the power of all the world nor the strength of nations can weaken.
There is no God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Protector, the
Self-Subsistent.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O God, Who art the Author of all Manifestations,...”


O God, Who art the Author of all Manifestations, the Source of all
Sources, the Fountainhead of all Revelations, and the Wellspring of all
Lights! I testify that by Thy Name the heaven of understanding hath been
adorned, and the ocean of utterance hath surged, and the dispensations of
Thy providence have been promulgated unto the followers of all religions.

I beseech Thee so to enrich me as to dispense with all save Thee, and be
made independent of anyone except Thyself. Rain down, then, upon me out of
the clouds of Thy bounty that which shall profit me in every world of Thy
worlds. Assist me, then, through Thy strengthening grace, so to serve Thy
Cause amidst Thy servants that I may show forth what will cause me to be
remembered as long as Thine own kingdom endureth and Thy dominion will
last.

This is Thy servant, O my Lord, who with his whole being hath turned unto
the horizon of Thy bounty, and the ocean of Thy grace, and the heaven of
Thy gifts. Do with me then as becometh Thy majesty, and Thy glory, and Thy
bounteousness, and Thy grace.

Thou, in truth, art the God of strength and power, Who art meet to answer
them that pray Thee. There is no God save Thee, the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up...”


O my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up the Word, and to refute what is
vain and false, to establish the truth, to spread the sacred verses
abroad, reveal the splendors, and make the morning’s light to dawn in the
hearts of the righteous.

Thou art, verily, the Generous, the Forgiving.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“O God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants...”


O God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants to have loving and tender
hearts. Help them to spread, amongst all the nations of the earth, the
light of guidance that cometh from the Company on high. Verily, Thou art
the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Ever-Giving.
Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Gentle, the Tender, the Most Bountiful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in...”


Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in lowliness, humbling myself before
Thy commandments, submitting to Thy sovereignty, trembling at the might of
Thy dominion, fleeing from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, relying upon
Thy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy fury. I implore Thee with a
throbbing heart, with streaming tears and a yearning soul, and in complete
detachment from all things, to make Thy lovers as rays of light across Thy
realms, and to aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, that their faces
may turn beauteous and bright with splendor, that their hearts may be
filled with mysteries, and that every soul may lay down its burden of sin.
Guard them then from the aggressor, from him who hath become a shameless
and blasphemous doer of wrong.

Verily, Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them to the wellspring of
bounty and grace. Verily, they hunger; send down unto them Thy heavenly
table. Verily, they are naked; robe them in the garments of learning and
knowledge.

Heroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of battle. Guides are
they, make them to speak out with arguments and proofs. Ministering
servants are they, cause them to pass round the cup that brimmeth with the
wine of certitude. O my God, make them to be songsters that carol in fair
gardens, make them lions that couch in the thickets, whales that plunge in
the vasty deep.

Verily, Thou art He of abounding grace. There is none other God save Thee,
the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.

PRAYERS FOR TEACHING FROM THE TABLETS OF THE DIVINE PLAN



REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: “O Thou
incomparable God! O Thou Lord of...”


O Thou incomparable God! O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! These souls are Thy
heavenly army. Assist them and, with the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse,
make them victorious, so that each one of them may become like unto a
regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God and the
illumination of divine teachings.

O God! Be Thou their supporter and their helper, and in the wilderness,
the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas, be Thou
their confidant—so that they may cry out through the power of the Kingdom
and the breath of the Holy Spirit.

Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Omnipotent, and Thou art
the Wise, the Hearing and the Seeing.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: “O God, my God!
Thou seest me enraptured...”


Whoever sets out on a teaching journey to any place, let him recite this
prayer day and night during his travels in foreign lands.

O God, my God! Thou seest me enraptured and attracted toward Thy glorious
kingdom, enkindled with the fire of Thy love amongst mankind, a herald of
Thy kingdom in these vast and spacious lands, severed from aught else save
Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest and comfort, remote from my native
home, a wanderer in these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground,
humble before Thine exalted Threshold, submissive toward the heaven of
Thine omnipotent glory, supplicating Thee in the dead of night and at the
break of dawn, entreating and invoking Thee at morn and at eventide to
graciously aid me to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad Thy Teachings and
to exalt Thy Word throughout the East and the West.

O Lord! Strengthen my back, enable me to serve Thee with the utmost
endeavor, and leave me not to myself, lonely and helpless in these
regions.

O Lord! Grant me communion with Thee in my loneliness, and be my companion
in these foreign lands.

Verily, Thou art the Confirmer of whomsoever Thou willest in that which
Thou desirest, and, verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: “O God! O God!
Thou seest my weakness,...”


Let whosoever travels to different parts to teach, peruse over mountain,
desert, land and sea this supplication.

O God! O God! Thou seest my weakness, lowliness and humility before Thy
creatures; nevertheless, I have trusted in Thee and have arisen in the
promotion of Thy teachings among Thy strong servants, relying on Thy power
and might.

O Lord! I am a broken-winged bird and desire to soar in Thy limitless
space. How is it possible for me to do this save through Thy providence
and grace, Thy confirmation and assistance.

O Lord! Have pity on my weakness, and strengthen me with Thy power. O
Lord! Have pity on my impotence, and assist me with Thy might and majesty.

O Lord! Should the breath of the Holy Spirit confirm the weakest of
creatures, he would attain all to which he aspireth and would possess
anything he desireth. Indeed, Thou hast assisted Thy servants in the past
and, though they were the weakest of Thy creatures, the lowliest of Thy
servants and the most insignificant of those who lived upon the earth,
through Thy sanction and potency they took precedence over the most
glorious of Thy people and the most noble of mankind. Whereas formerly
they were as moths, they became as royal falcons, and whereas before they
were as brooks, they became as seas, through Thy bestowal and Thy mercy.
They became, through Thy most great favor, stars shining on the horizon of
guidance, birds singing in the rose gardens of immortality, lions roaring
in the forests of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming in the oceans
of life.

Verily, Thou art the Clement, the Powerful, the Mighty, and the Most
Merciful of the merciful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: “O God, my God!
Thou seest how black darkness...”


O God, my God! Thou seest how black darkness is enshrouding all regions,
how all countries are burning with the flame of dissension, and the fire
of war and carnage is blazing throughout the East and the West. Blood is
flowing, corpses bestrew the ground, and severed heads are fallen on the
dust of the battlefield.

O Lord! Have pity on these ignorant ones, and look upon them with the eye
of forgiveness and pardon. Extinguish this fire, so that these dense
clouds which obscure the horizon may be scattered, the Sun of Reality
shine forth with the rays of conciliation, this intense gloom be dispelled
and the resplendent light of peace shed its radiance upon all countries.

O Lord! Draw up the people from the abyss of the ocean of hatred and
enmity, and deliver them from this impenetrable darkness. Unite their
hearts, and brighten their eyes with the light of peace and
reconciliation. Deliver them from the depths of war and bloodshed, and
free them from the darkness of error. Remove the veil from their eyes, and
enlighten their hearts with the light of guidance. Treat them with Thy
tender mercy and compassion, and deal not with them according to Thy
justice and wrath which cause the limbs of the mighty to quake.

O Lord! Wars have persisted. Distress and anxiety have waxed great, and
every flourishing region is laid waste.

O Lord! Hearts are heavy, and souls are in anguish. Have mercy on these
poor souls, and do not leave them to the excesses of their own desires.

O Lord! Make manifest in Thy lands humble and submissive souls, their
faces illumined with the rays of guidance, severed from the world,
extolling Thy Name, uttering Thy praise, and diffusing the fragrance of
Thy holiness amongst mankind.

O Lord! Strengthen their backs, gird up their loins, and enrapture their
hearts with the most mighty signs of Thy love.

O Lord! Verily, they are weak, and Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty;
they are impotent, and Thou art the Helper and the Merciful.

O Lord! The ocean of rebellion is surging, and these tempests will not be
stilled save through Thy boundless grace which hath embraced all regions.

O Lord! Verily, the people are in the abyss of passion, and naught can
save them but Thine infinite bounties.

O Lord! Dispel the darkness of these corrupt desires, and illumine the
hearts with the lamp of Thy love through which all countries will erelong
be enlightened. Confirm, moreover, Thy loved ones, those who, leaving
their homelands, their families and their children, have, for the love of
Thy Beauty, traveled to foreign countries to diffuse Thy fragrances and
promulgate Thy Teachings. Be Thou their companion in their loneliness,
their helper in a strange land, the remover of their sorrows, their
comforter in calamity. Be Thou a refreshing draught for their thirst, a
healing medicine for their ills and a balm for the burning ardor of their
hearts.

Verily, Thou art the Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding, and,
verily, Thou art the Compassionate and the Merciful.

REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE NORTHEASTERN STATES: “O Thou kind Lord!
Praise be unto Thee that...”


The following supplication is to be read by the teachers and friends
daily:

O Thou kind Lord! Praise be unto Thee that Thou hast shown us the highway
of guidance, opened the doors of the kingdom and manifested Thyself
through the Sun of Reality. To the blind Thou hast given sight; to the
deaf Thou hast granted hearing; Thou hast resuscitated the dead; Thou hast
enriched the poor; Thou hast shown the way to those who have gone astray;
Thou hast led those with parched lips to the fountain of guidance; Thou
hast suffered the thirsty fish to reach the ocean of reality; and Thou
hast invited the wandering birds to the rose garden of grace.

O Thou Almighty! We are Thy servants and Thy poor ones; we are remote and
yearn for Thy presence, are athirst for the water of Thy fountain, are
ill, longing for Thy healing. We are walking in Thy path and have no aim
or hope save the diffusion of Thy fragrance, so that all souls may raise
the cry of “O God, guide us to the straight path.” May their eyes be
opened to behold the light, and may they be freed from the darkness of
ignorance. May they gather around the lamp of Thy guidance. May every
portionless one receive a share. May the deprived become the confidants of
Thy mysteries.

O Almighty! Look upon us with the glance of mercifulness. Grant us
heavenly confirmation. Bestow upon us the breath of the Holy Spirit, so
that we may be assisted in Thy service and, like unto brilliant stars,
shine in these regions with the light of Thy guidance.

Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise and the Seeing.

REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES: “O my God! O my God! Thou
seest me in...”


Every soul who travels through the cities, villages and hamlets of these
States and is engaged in the diffusion of the fragrances of God, should
peruse this commune every morning:

O my God! O my God! Thou seest me in my lowliness and weakness, occupied
with the greatest undertaking, determined to raise Thy word among the
masses and to spread Thy teachings among Thy peoples. How can I succeed
unless Thou assist me with the breath of the Holy Spirit, help me to
triumph by the hosts of Thy glorious kingdom, and shower upon me Thy
confirmations, which alone can change a gnat into an eagle, a drop of
water into rivers and seas, and an atom into lights and suns? O my Lord!
Assist me with Thy triumphant and effective might, so that my tongue may
utter Thy praises and attributes among all people and my soul overflow
with the wine of Thy love and knowledge.

Thou art the Omnipotent and the Doer of whatsoever Thou willest.

REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE CENTRAL STATES: “O Lord, my God! Praise and
thanksgiving be...”


Let the spreaders of the fragrances of God recite this prayer every
morning:

O Lord, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee for Thou hast guided
me to the highway of the kingdom, suffered me to walk in this straight and
far-stretching path, illumined my eye by beholding the splendors of Thy
light, inclined my ear to the melodies of the birds of holiness from the
kingdom of mysteries and attracted my heart with Thy love among the
righteous.

O Lord! Confirm me with the Holy Spirit, so that I may call in Thy Name
amongst the nations and give the glad tidings of the manifestation of Thy
kingdom amongst mankind.

O Lord! I am weak, strengthen me with Thy power and potency. My tongue
falters, suffer me to utter Thy commemoration and praise. I am lowly,
honor me through admitting me into Thy kingdom. I am remote, cause me to
approach the threshold of Thy mercifulness. O Lord! Make me a brilliant
lamp, a shining star and a blessed tree, adorned with fruit, its branches
overshadowing all these regions. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful
and Unconstrained.

REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF THE WESTERN STATES: “O God! O God! This is a
broken-winged bird...”


The following commune is to be read ... every day:

O God! O God! This is a broken-winged bird and his flight is very
slow—assist him so that he may fly toward the apex of prosperity and
salvation, wing his way with the utmost joy and happiness throughout the
illimitable space, raise his melody in Thy Supreme Name in all the
regions, exhilarate the ears with this call, and brighten the eyes by
beholding the signs of guidance.

O Lord! I am single, alone and lowly. For me there is no support save
Thee, no helper except Thee and no sustainer beside Thee. Confirm me in
Thy service, assist me with the cohorts of Thy angels, make me victorious
in the promotion of Thy Word and suffer me to speak out Thy wisdom amongst
Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the helper of the weak and the defender of
the little ones, and verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the
Unconstrained.

REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF CANADA: “Praise be to Thee, O my God! These are
Thy...”


Praise be to Thee, O my God! These are Thy servants who are attracted by
the fragrances of Thy mercifulness, are enkindled by the fire burning in
the tree of Thy singleness, and whose eyes are brightened by beholding the
splendors of the light shining in the Sinai of Thy oneness.

O Lord! Loose their tongues to make mention of Thee amongst Thy people,
suffer them to speak forth Thy praise through Thy grace and
loving-kindness, assist them with the cohorts of Thine angels, strengthen
their loins in Thy service, and make them the signs of Thy guidance
amongst Thy creatures.

Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving,
the All-Merciful.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



REVEALED TO THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF CANADA: “O God, my God! Thou beholdest this
weak...”


The spreaders of the fragrances of God should recite this prayer every
morning:

O God, my God! Thou beholdest this weak one begging for celestial
strength, this poor one craving Thy heavenly treasures, this thirsty one
longing for the fountain of eternal life, this afflicted one yearning for
Thy promised healing through Thy boundless mercy which Thou hast destined
for Thy chosen servants in Thy kingdom on high.

O Lord! I have no helper save Thee, no shelter besides Thee, and no
sustainer except Thee. Assist me with Thine angels to diffuse Thy holy
fragrances and to spread abroad Thy teachings amongst the choicest of Thy
people.

O my Lord! Suffer me to be detached from aught else save Thee, to hold
fast to the hem of Thy bounty, to be wholly devoted to Thy Faith, to
remain fast and firm in Thy love and to observe what Thou hast prescribed
in Thy Book.

Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




TESTS AND DIFFICULTIES



“O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine...”


O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine to such as are nigh unto Thee,
Whose sword is the ardent desire of all them that love Thee, Whose dart is
the dearest wish of those hearts that yearn after Thee, Whose decree is
the sole hope of them that have recognized Thy truth! I implore Thee, by
Thy divine sweetness and by the splendors of the glory of Thy face, to
send down upon us from Thy retreats on high that which will enable us to
draw nigh unto Thee. Set, then, our feet firm, O my God, in Thy Cause, and
enlighten our hearts with the effulgence of Thy knowledge, and illumine
our breasts with the brightness of Thy names.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory to Thee, O my God! But for the tribulations...”


Glory to Thee, O my God! But for the tribulations which are sustained in
Thy path, how could Thy true lovers be recognized; and were it not for the
trials which are borne for love of Thee, how could the station of such as
yearn for Thee be revealed? Thy might beareth me witness! The companions
of all who adore Thee are the tears they shed, and the comforters of such
as seek Thee are the groans they utter, and the food of them who haste to
meet Thee is the fragments of their broken hearts.

How sweet to my taste is the bitterness of death suffered in Thy path, and
how precious in my estimation are the shafts of Thine enemies when
encountered for the sake of the exaltation of Thy word! Let me quaff in
Thy Cause, O my God, whatsoever Thou didst desire, and send down upon me
in Thy love all Thou didst ordain. By Thy glory! I wish only what Thou
wishest, and cherish what Thou cherishest. In Thee have I, at all times,
placed my whole trust and confidence.

Raise up, I implore Thee, O my God, as helpers to this Revelation such as
shall be counted worthy of Thy name and of Thy sovereignty, that they may
remember me among Thy creatures, and hoist the ensigns of Thy victory in
Thy land.

Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. No God is there but Thee, the
Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every...”


Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every man of insight confesseth Thy
sovereignty and Thy dominion, and every discerning eye perceiveth the
greatness of Thy majesty and the compelling power of Thy might. The winds
of tests are powerless to hold back them that enjoy near access to Thee
from setting their faces towards the horizon of Thy glory, and the
tempests of trials must fail to draw away and hinder such as are wholly
devoted to Thy will from approaching Thy court.

Methinks, the lamp of Thy love is burning in their hearts, and the light
of Thy tenderness is lit within their breasts. Adversities are incapable
of estranging them from Thy Cause, and the vicissitudes of fortune can
never cause them to stray from Thy pleasure.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by them and by the sighs which their hearts
utter in their separation from Thee, to keep them safe from the mischief
of Thine adversaries, and to nourish their souls with what Thou hast
ordained for Thy loved ones on whom shall come no fear and who shall not
be put to grief.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Thou knowest full well, O my God, that tribulations...”


Thou knowest full well, O my God, that tribulations have showered upon me
from all directions and that no one can dispel or transmute them except
Thee. I know of a certainty, by virtue of my love for Thee, that Thou wilt
never cause tribulations to befall any soul unless Thou desirest to exalt
his station in Thy celestial Paradise and to buttress his heart in this
earthly life with the bulwark of Thine all-compelling power, that it may
not become inclined toward the vanities of this world. Indeed Thou art
well aware that under all conditions I would cherish the remembrance of
Thee far more than the ownership of all that is in the heavens and on the
earth.

Strengthen my heart, O my God, in Thine obedience and in Thy love, and
grant that I may be clear of the entire company of Thine adversaries.
Verily, I swear by Thy glory that I yearn for naught besides Thyself, nor
do I desire anything except Thy mercy, nor am I apprehensive of aught save
Thy justice. I beg Thee to forgive me as well as those whom Thou lovest,
howsoever Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Bountiful.

Immensely exalted art Thou, O Lord of the heavens and earth, above the
praise of all men, and may peace be upon Thy faithful servants and glory
be unto God, the Lord of all the worlds.

—The Báb




TRIUMPH OF THE CAUSE



“Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Darkness...”


Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Darkness hath fallen upon every land,
and the forces of mischief have encompassed all the nations. Through them,
however, I perceive the splendors of Thy wisdom, and discern the
brightness of the light of Thy providence.

They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee have imagined that they have
the power to put out Thy light, and to quench Thy fire, and to still the
winds of Thy grace. Nay, and to this Thy might beareth me witness! Had not
every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy wisdom, and every ordeal the
vehicle of Thy providence, no one would have dared oppose us, though the
powers of earth and heaven were to be leagued against us. Were I to
unravel the wondrous mysteries of Thy wisdom which are laid bare before
me, the reins of Thine enemies would be cleft asunder.

Glorified be Thou, then, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name
to assemble them that love Thee around the Law that streameth from the
good pleasure of Thy will, and to send down upon them what will assure
their hearts.

Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“Glory be unto Thee, O Lord, Thou Who hast...”


Glory be unto Thee, O Lord, Thou Who hast brought into being all created
things, through the power of Thy behest.

O Lord! Assist those who have renounced all else but Thee, and grant them
a mighty victory. Send down upon them, O Lord, the concourse of the angels
in heaven and earth and all that is between, to aid Thy servants, to
succor and strengthen them, to enable them to achieve success, to sustain
them, to invest them with glory, to confer upon them honor and exaltation,
to enrich them and to make them triumphant with a wondrous triumph.

Thou art their Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of
all the worlds. Strengthen this Faith, O Lord, through the power of these
servants, and cause them to prevail over all the peoples of the world; for
they, of a truth, are Thy servants who have detached themselves from aught
else but Thee, and Thou, verily, art the protector of true believers.

Grant Thou, O Lord, that their hearts may, through allegiance to this,
Thine inviolable Faith, grow stronger than anything else in the heavens
and on earth and in whatsoever is between them; and strengthen, O Lord,
their hands with the tokens of Thy wondrous power that they may manifest
Thy power before the gaze of all mankind.

“O Lord! Provide for the speedy growth of the...”


O Lord! Provide for the speedy growth of the Tree of Thy divine Unity;
water it then, O Lord, with the flowing waters of Thy good-pleasure, and
cause it, before the revelations of Thy divine assurance, to yield such
fruits as Thou desirest for Thy glorification and exaltation, Thy praise
and thanksgiving, and to magnify Thy Name, to laud the oneness of Thine
Essence and to offer adoration unto Thee, inasmuch as all this lieth
within Thy grasp and in that of none other.

Great is the blessedness of those whose blood Thou hast chosen wherewith
to water the Tree of Thine affirmation, and thus to exalt Thy holy and
immutable Word.

—The Báb



“O Lord! Render victorious Thy forbearing...”


O Lord! Render victorious Thy forbearing servants in Thy days by granting
them a befitting victory, inasmuch as they have sought martyrdom in Thy
path. Send down upon them that which will bring comfort to their minds,
will rejoice their inner beings, will impart assurance to their hearts and
tranquillity to their bodies and will enable their souls to ascend to the
presence of God, the Most Exalted, and to attain the supreme Paradise and
such retreats of glory as Thou hast destined for men of true knowledge and
virtue. Verily, Thou knowest all things, while we are but Thy servants,
Thy thralls, Thy bondsmen and Thy poor ones. No Lord but Thee do we
invoke, O God our Lord, nor do we implore blessings or grace from anyone
but Thee, O Thou Who art the God of mercy unto this world and the next. We
are but the embodiments of poverty, of nothingness, of helplessness and of
perdition, while Thy whole Being betokeneth wealth, independence, glory,
majesty and boundless grace.

Turn our recompense, O Lord, into that which well beseemeth Thee of the
good of this world and of the next, and of the manifold bounties which
extend from on high down to the earth below.

Verily, Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all things. Into Thy hands do we
surrender ourselves, yearning for the things that pertain unto Thee.

—The Báb



“O Lord! Enable all the peoples of the earth to...”


O Lord! Enable all the peoples of the earth to gain admittance into the
Paradise of Thy Faith, so that no created being may remain beyond the
bounds of Thy good-pleasure.

From time immemorial Thou hast been potent to do what pleaseth Thee and
transcendent above whatsoever Thou desirest.

—The Báb



“O God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for...”


O God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for kindling the fire of divine love in
the Holy Tree on the summit of the loftiest mount: that Tree which is
“neither of the East nor of the West,”(8) that fire which blazed out till
the flame of it soared upward to the Concourse on high, and from it those
realities caught the light of guidance, and cried out: “Verily have we
perceived a fire on the slope of Mount Sinai.”(9)

O God, my God! Increase Thou this fire, as day followeth day, till the
blast of it setteth in motion all the earth. O Thou, my Lord! Kindle the
light of Thy love in every heart, breathe into men’s souls the spirit of
Thy knowledge, gladden their breasts with the verses of Thy oneness. Call
Thou to life those who dwell in their tombs, warn Thou the prideful, make
happiness worldwide, send down Thy crystal waters, and in the assemblage
of manifest splendors, pass round that cup which is “tempered at the
camphor fountain.”(10)

Verily, art Thou the Giving, the Forgiving, the Ever-Bestowing. Verily,
art Thou the Merciful, the Compassionate.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá



“He is God!...”


He is God!

O Lord, my God, my Well-Beloved! These are servants of Thine that have
heard Thy Voice, given ear to Thy Word and hearkened to Thy Call. They
have believed in Thee, witnessed Thy wonders, acknowledged Thy proof and
testified to Thine evidence. They have walked in Thy ways, followed Thy
guidance, discovered Thy mysteries, comprehended the secrets of Thy Book,
the verses of Thy Scrolls and the tidings of Thy Epistles and Tablets.
They have clung to the hem of Thy garment and held fast unto the robe of
Thy light and grandeur. Their footsteps have been strengthened in Thy
Covenant and their hearts made firm in Thy Testament. Lord! Do Thou kindle
in their hearts the flame of Thy divine attraction and grant that the bird
of love and understanding may sing within their hearts. Grant that they
may be even as potent signs, resplendent standards, and perfect as Thy
Word. Exalt by them Thy Cause, unfurl Thy banners and publish far and wide
Thy wonders. Make by them Thy Word triumphant, and strengthen the loins of
Thy loved ones. Unloose their tongues to laud Thy Name, and inspire them
to do Thy holy will and pleasure. Illumine their faces in Thy Kingdom of
holiness, and perfect their joy by aiding them to arise for the triumph of
Thy Cause.

Lord! Feeble are we, strengthen us to diffuse the fragrances of Thy
Holiness; poor, enrich us from the treasures of Thy Divine Unity; naked,
clothe us with the robe of Thy bounty; sinful, forgive us our sins by Thy
grace, Thy favor and Thy pardon. Thou art, verily, the Aider, the Helper,
the Gracious, the Mighty, the Powerful.

The glory of glories rest upon them that are fast and firm.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




UNITY



“O my God! O my God! Unite the hearts of...”


O my God! O my God! Unite the hearts of Thy servants, and reveal to them
Thy great purpose. May they follow Thy commandments and abide in Thy law.
Help them, O God, in their endeavor, and grant them strength to serve
Thee. O God! Leave them not to themselves, but guide their steps by the
light of Thy knowledge, and cheer their hearts by Thy love. Verily, Thou
art their Helper and their Lord.

—Bahá’u’lláh



“O my God! O my God! Verily, I invoke Thee...”


O my God! O my God! Verily, I invoke Thee and supplicate before Thy
threshold, asking Thee that all Thy mercies may descend upon these souls.
Specialize them for Thy favor and Thy truth.

O Lord! Unite and bind together the hearts, join in accord all the souls,
and exhilarate the spirits through the signs of Thy sanctity and oneness.
O Lord! Make these faces radiant through the light of Thy oneness.
Strengthen the loins of Thy servants in the service of Thy kingdom.

O Lord, Thou possessor of infinite mercy! O Lord of forgiveness and
pardon! Forgive our sins, pardon our shortcomings, and cause us to turn to
the kingdom of Thy clemency, invoking the kingdom of might and power,
humble at Thy shrine and submissive before the glory of Thine evidences.

O Lord God! Make us as waves of the sea, as flowers of the garden, united,
agreed through the bounties of Thy love. O Lord! Dilate the breasts
through the signs of Thy oneness, and make all mankind as stars shining
from the same height of glory, as perfect fruits growing upon Thy tree of
life.

Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Self-Subsistent, the Giver, the
Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Omniscient, the One Creator.

OCCASIONAL PRAYERS




TABLET OF AḤMAD



“He is the King, the All-Knowing, the Wise!...”


“These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few other specific ones,
such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of Aḥmad, have been invested by
Bahá’u’lláh with a special potency and significance, and should therefore
be accepted as such and be recited by the believers with unquestioning
faith and confidence, that through them they may enter into a much closer
communion with God, and identify themselves more fully with His laws and
precepts.”

—From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

He is the King, the All-Knowing, the Wise! Lo, the Nightingale of Paradise
singeth upon the twigs of the Tree of Eternity, with holy and sweet
melodies, proclaiming to the sincere ones the glad tidings of the nearness
of God, calling the believers in the Divine Unity to the court of the
Presence of the Generous One, informing the severed ones of the message
which hath been revealed by God, the King, the Glorious, the Peerless,
guiding the lovers to the seat of sanctity and to this resplendent Beauty.

Verily this is that Most Great Beauty, foretold in the Books of the
Messengers, through Whom truth shall be distinguished from error and the
wisdom of every command shall be tested. Verily He is the Tree of Life
that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the
Great.

O Aḥmad! Bear thou witness that verily He is God and there is no God but
Him, the King, the Protector, the Incomparable, the Omnipotent. And that
the One Whom He hath sent forth by the name of ‘Alí(11) was the true One
from God, to Whose commands we are all conforming.

Say: O people be obedient to the ordinances of God, which have been
enjoined in the Bayán by the Glorious, the Wise One. Verily He is the King
of the Messengers and His Book is the Mother Book did ye but know.

Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto you from this prison. He
hath but to deliver this clear message. Whosoever desireth, let him turn
aside from this counsel and whosoever desireth let him choose the path to
his Lord.

O people, if ye deny these verses, by what proof have ye believed in God?
Produce it, O assemblage of false ones.

Nay, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, they are not, and never shall be
able to do this, even should they combine to assist one another.

O Aḥmad! Forget not My Bounties while I am absent. Remember My days during
thy days, and My distress and banishment in this remote prison. And be
thou so steadfast in My love that thy heart shall not waver, even if the
swords of the enemies rain blows upon thee and all the heavens and the
earth arise against thee.

Be thou as a flame of fire to My enemies and a river of life eternal to My
loved ones, and be not of those who doubt.

And if thou art overtaken by affliction in My path, or degradation for My
sake, be not thou troubled thereby.

Rely upon God, thy God and the Lord of thy fathers. For the people are
wandering in the paths of delusion, bereft of discernment to see God with
their own eyes, or hear His Melody with their own ears. Thus have We found
them, as thou also dost witness.

Thus have their superstitions become veils between them and their own
hearts and kept them from the path of God, the Exalted, the Great.

Be thou assured in thyself that verily, he who turns away from this Beauty
hath also turned away from the Messengers of the past and showeth pride
towards God from all eternity to all eternity.

Learn well this Tablet, O Aḥmad. Chant it during thy days and withhold not
thyself therefrom. For verily, God hath ordained for the one who chants
it, the reward of a hundred martyrs and a service in both worlds. These
favors have We bestowed upon thee as a bounty on Our part and a mercy from
Our presence, that thou mayest be of those who are grateful.

By God! Should one who is in affliction or grief read this Tablet with
absolute sincerity, God will dispel his sadness, solve his difficulties
and remove his afflictions.

Verily, He is the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to God, the Lord
of all the worlds.

“In the Name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Great....”


In the Name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Great.

Indeed the hearts of the sincere are consumed in the fire of separation:
Where is the gleaming of the light of Thy Countenance, O Beloved of the
worlds?

Those who are near unto Thee have been abandoned in the darkness of
desolation: Where is the shining of the morn of Thy reunion, O Desire of
the worlds?

The bodies of Thy chosen ones lie quivering on distant sands: Where is the
ocean of Thy presence, O Enchanter of the worlds?

Longing hands are uplifted to the heaven of Thy grace and generosity:
Where are the rains of Thy bestowal, O Answerer of the worlds?

The infidels have arisen in tyranny on every hand: Where is the compelling
power of Thine ordaining pen, O Conqueror of the worlds?

The barking of dogs is loud on every side: Where is the lion of the forest
of Thy might, O Chastiser of the worlds?

Coldness hath gripped all mankind: Where is the warmth of Thy love, O Fire
of the worlds?

Calamity hath reached its height: Where are the signs of Thy succor, O
Salvation of the worlds?

Darkness hath enveloped most of the peoples: Where is the brightness of
Thy splendor, O Radiance of the worlds?

The necks of men are stretched out in malice: Where are the swords of Thy
vengeance, O Destroyer of the worlds?

Abasement hath reached its lowest depth: Where are the emblems of Thy
glory, O Glory of the worlds?

Sorrows have afflicted the Revealer of Thy Name, the All-Merciful: Where
is the joy of the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, O Delight of the worlds?

Anguish hath befallen all the peoples of the earth: Where are the ensigns
of Thy gladness, O Joy of the worlds?

Thou seest the Dawning Place of Thy signs veiled by evil suggestions:
Where are the fingers of Thy might, O Power of the worlds?

Sore thirst hath overcome all men: Where is the river of Thy bounty, O
Mercy of the worlds?

Greed hath made captive all mankind: Where are the embodiments of
detachment, O Lord of the worlds?

Thou seest this Wronged One lonely in exile: Where are the hosts of the
heaven of Thy Command, O Sovereign of the worlds?

I have been forsaken in a foreign land: Where are the emblems of Thy
faithfulness, O Trust of the worlds?

The agonies of death have laid hold on all men: Where is the surging of
Thine ocean of eternal life, O Life of the worlds?

The whisperings of Satan have been breathed to every creature: Where is
the meteor of Thy fire, O Light of the worlds?

The drunkenness of passion hath perverted most of mankind: Where are the
daysprings of purity, O Desire of the worlds?

Thou seest this Wronged One veiled in tyranny among the Syrians: Where is
the radiance of Thy dawning light, O Light of the worlds?

Thou seest Me forbidden to speak forth: Then from where will spring Thy
melodies, O Nightingale of the worlds?

Most of the people are enwrapped in fancy and idle imaginings: Where are
the exponents of Thy certitude, O Assurance of the worlds?

Bahá is drowning in a sea of tribulation: Where is the Ark of Thy
salvation, O Savior of the worlds?

Thou seest the Dayspring of Thine utterance in the darkness of creation:
Where is the sun of the heaven of Thy grace, O Lightgiver of the worlds?

The lamps of truth and purity, of loyalty and honor, have been put out:
Where are the signs of Thine avenging wrath, O Mover of the worlds?

Canst Thou see any who have championed Thy Self, or who ponder on what
hath befallen Him in the pathway of Thy love? Now doth My pen halt, O
Beloved of the worlds.

The branches of the Divine Lote-Tree lie broken by the onrushing gales of
destiny: Where are the banners of Thy succor, O Champion of the worlds?

This Face is hidden in the dust of slander: Where are the breezes of Thy
compassion, O Mercy of the worlds?

The robe of sanctity is sullied by the people of deceit: Where is the
vesture of Thy holiness, O Adorner of the worlds?

The sea of grace is stilled for what the hands of men have wrought: Where
are the waves of Thy bounty, O Desire of the worlds?

The door leading to the Divine Presence is locked through the tyranny of
Thy foes: Where is the key of Thy bestowal, O Unlocker of the worlds?

The leaves are yellowed by the poisoning winds of sedition: Where is the
downpour of the clouds of Thy bounty, O Giver of the worlds?

The universe is darkened with the dust of sin: Where are the breezes of
Thy forgiveness, O Forgiver of the worlds?

This Youth is lonely in a desolate land: Where is the rain of Thy heavenly
grace, O Bestower of the worlds?

O Supreme Pen, We have heard Thy most sweet call in the eternal realm:
Give Thou ear unto what the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth, O Wronged One of
the worlds!

Were it not for the cold, how would the heat of Thy words prevail, O
Expounder of the worlds?

Were it not for calamity, how would the sun of Thy patience shine, O Light
of the worlds?

Lament not because of the wicked. Thou wert created to bear and endure, O
Patience of the worlds.

How sweet was Thy dawning on the horizon of the Covenant among the
stirrers of sedition, and Thy yearning after God, O Love of the worlds.

By Thee the banner of independence was planted on the highest peaks, and
the sea of bounty surged, O Rapture of the worlds.

By Thine aloneness the Sun of Oneness shone, and by Thy banishment the
land of Unity was adorned. Be patient, O Thou Exile of the worlds.

We have made abasement the garment of glory, and affliction the adornment
of Thy temple, O Pride of the worlds.

Thou seest the hearts are filled with hate, and to overlook is Thine, O
Thou Concealer of the sins of the worlds.

When the swords flash, go forward! When the shafts fly, press onward! O
Thou Sacrifice of the worlds.

Dost Thou wail, or shall I wail? Rather shall I weep at the fewness of Thy
champions, O Thou Who hast caused the wailing of the worlds.

Verily, I have heard Thy Call, O All-Glorious Beloved; and now is the face
of Bahá flaming with the heat of tribulation and with the fire of Thy
shining word, and He hath risen up in faithfulness at the place of
sacrifice, looking toward Thy pleasure, O Ordainer of the worlds.

O ‘Alí-Akbar, thank thy Lord for this Tablet whence thou canst breathe the
fragrances of My meekness, and know what hath beset Us in the path of God,
the Adored of all the worlds.

Should all the servants read and ponder this, there shall be kindled in
their veins a fire that shall set aflame the worlds.

—Bahá’u’lláh




TABLET OF THE HOLY MARINER


“Study the Tablet of the Holy Mariner that ye may know the truth, and
consider that the Blessed Beauty hath fully foretold future events. Let
them who perceive, take warning!”—‘Abdu’l-Bahá




“He is the Gracious, the Well-Beloved! O Holy Mariner!...”


He is the Gracious, the Well-Beloved!

O Holy Mariner!

Bid thine ark of eternity appear before the Celestial Concourse,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Launch it upon the ancient sea, in His Name, the Most Wondrous,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And let the angelic spirits enter, in the Name of God, the Most High.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Unmoor it, then, that it may sail upon the ocean of glory,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Haply the dwellers therein may attain the retreats of nearness in the
everlasting realm.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Having reached the sacred strand, the shore of the crimson seas,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Bid them issue forth and attain this ethereal invisible station,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

A station wherein the Lord hath in the Flame of His Beauty appeared within
the deathless tree;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Wherein the embodiments of His Cause cleansed themselves of self and
passion;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Around which the Glory of Moses doth circle with the everlasting hosts;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Wherein the Hand of God was drawn forth from His bosom of Grandeur;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Wherein the ark of the Cause remaineth motionless even though to its
dwellers be declared all divine attributes.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

O Mariner! Teach them that are within the ark that which we have taught
thee behind the mystic veil,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Perchance they may not tarry in the sacred snow-white spot,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

But may soar upon the wings of the spirit unto that station which the Lord
hath exalted above all mention in the worlds below,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

May wing through space even as the favored birds in the realm of eternal
reunion;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

May know the mysteries hidden in the Seas of light.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

They passed the grades of worldly limitations and reached that of the
divine unity, the center of heavenly guidance.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

They have desired to ascend unto that state which the Lord hath ordained
to be above their stations.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Whereupon the burning meteor cast them out from them that abide in the
Kingdom of His Presence,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And they heard the Voice of Grandeur raised from behind the unseen
pavilion upon the Height of Glory:

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“O guardian angels! Return them to their abode in the world below,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Inasmuch as they have purposed to rise to that sphere which the wings of
the celestial dove have never attained;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Whereupon the ship of fancy standeth still which the minds of them that
comprehend cannot grasp.”

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Whereupon the maid of heaven looked out from her exalted chamber,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And with her brow signed to the Celestial Concourse,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Flooding with the light of her countenance the heaven and the earth,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And as the radiance of her beauty shone upon the people of dust,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

All beings were shaken in their mortal graves.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She then raised the call which no ear through all eternity hath ever
heard,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And thus proclaimed: “By the Lord! He whose heart hath not the fragrance
of the love of the exalted and glorious Arabian Youth,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Can in no wise ascend unto the glory of the highest heaven.”

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Thereupon she summoned unto herself one maiden from her handmaidens,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And commanded her: “Descend into space from the mansions of eternity,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“And turn thou unto that which they have concealed in the inmost of their
hearts.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Shouldst thou inhale the perfume of the robe from the Youth that hath
been hidden within the tabernacle of light by reason of that which the
hands of the wicked have wrought,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Raise a cry within thyself, that all the inmates of the chambers of
Paradise, that are the embodiments of the eternal wealth, may understand
and hearken;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“That they may all come down from their everlasting chambers and tremble,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“And kiss their hands and feet for having soared to the heights of
faithfulness;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“Perchance they may find from their robes the fragrance of the Beloved
One.”

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Thereupon the countenance of the favored damsel beamed above the celestial
chambers even as the light that shineth from the face of the Youth above
His mortal temple;

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She then descended with such an adorning as to illumine the heavens and
all that is therein.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She bestirred herself and perfumed all things in the lands of holiness and
grandeur.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

When she reached that place she rose to her full height in the midmost
heart of creation,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that knoweth neither
beginning nor end.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She found not in them that which she did desire, and this, verily, is but
one of His wondrous tales.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She then cried aloud, wailed and repaired to her own station within her
most lofty mansion,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And then gave utterance to one mystic word, whispered privily by her
honeyed tongue,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And raised the call amidst the Celestial Concourse and the immortal maids
of heaven:

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“By the Lord! I found not from these idle claimants the breeze of
Faithfulness!

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

“By the Lord! The Youth hath remained lone and forlorn in the land of
exile in the hands of the ungodly.”

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

She then uttered within herself such a cry that the Celestial Concourse
did shriek and tremble,

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And she fell upon the dust and gave up the spirit. It seemeth she was
called and hearkened unto Him that summoned her unto the Realm on High.

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Glorified be He that created her out of the essence of love in the midmost
heart of His exalted paradise!

Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

Thereupon the maids of heaven hastened forth from their chambers, upon
whose countenances the eye of no dweller in the highest paradise had ever
gazed.

Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!

They all gathered around her, and lo! they found her body fallen upon the
dust;

Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!

And as they beheld her state and comprehended a word of the tale told by
the Youth, they bared their heads, rent their garments asunder, beat upon
their faces, forgot their joy, shed tears and smote with their hands upon
their cheeks, and this is verily one of the mysterious grievous
afflictions—

Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!

TABLETS OF VISITATION




“The praise which hath dawned from Thy most...”


(This Tablet is read at the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. It is also
frequently used in commemorating Their anniversaries.)

The praise which hath dawned from Thy most august Self, and the glory
which hath shone forth from Thy most effulgent Beauty, rest upon Thee, O
Thou Who art the Manifestation of Grandeur, and the King of Eternity, and
the Lord of all who are in heaven and on earth! I testify that through
Thee the sovereignty of God and His dominion, and the majesty of God and
His grandeur, were revealed, and the Daystars of ancient splendor have
shed their radiance in the heaven of Thine irrevocable decree, and the
Beauty of the Unseen hath shone forth above the horizon of creation. I
testify, moreover, that with but a movement of Thy Pen Thine injunction
“Be Thou” hath been enforced, and God’s hidden Secret hath been divulged,
and all created things have been called into being, and all the
Revelations have been sent down.

I bear witness, moreover, that through Thy beauty the beauty of the Adored
One hath been unveiled, and through Thy face the face of the Desired One
hath shone forth, and that through a word from Thee Thou hast decided
between all created things, caused them who are devoted to Thee to ascend
unto the summit of glory, and the infidels to fall into the lowest abyss.

I bear witness that he who hath known Thee hath known God, and he who hath
attained unto Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of God. Great,
therefore, is the blessedness of him who hath believed in Thee, and in Thy
signs, and hath humbled himself before Thy sovereignty, and hath been
honored with meeting Thee, and hath attained the good pleasure of Thy
will, and circled around Thee, and stood before Thy throne. Woe betide him
that hath transgressed against Thee, and hath denied Thee, and repudiated
Thy signs, and gainsaid Thy sovereignty, and risen up against Thee, and
waxed proud before Thy face, and hath disputed Thy testimonies, and fled
from Thy rule and Thy dominion, and been numbered with the infidels whose
names have been inscribed by the fingers of Thy behest upon Thy holy
Tablets.

Waft, then, unto me, O my God and my Beloved, from the right hand of Thy
mercy and Thy loving-kindness, the holy breaths of Thy favors, that they
may draw me away from myself and from the world unto the courts of Thy
nearness and Thy presence. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou,
truly, hast been supreme over all things.

The remembrance of God and His praise, and the glory of God and His
splendor, rest upon Thee, O Thou Who art His Beauty! I bear witness that
the eye of creation hath never gazed upon one wronged like Thee. Thou wast
immersed all the days of Thy life beneath an ocean of tribulations. At one
time Thou wast in chains and fetters; at another Thou wast threatened by
the sword of Thine enemies. Yet, despite all this, Thou didst enjoin upon
all men to observe what had been prescribed unto Thee by Him Who is the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

May my spirit be a sacrifice to the wrongs Thou didst suffer, and my soul
be a ransom for the adversities Thou didst sustain. I beseech God, by Thee
and by them whose faces have been illumined with the splendors of the
light of Thy countenance, and who, for love of Thee, have observed all
whereunto they were bidden, to remove the veils that have come in between
Thee and Thy creatures, and to supply me with the good of this world and
the world to come. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the
All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.

Bless Thou, O Lord my God, the Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, and its
boughs, and its branches, and its stems, and its offshoots, as long as Thy
most excellent titles will endure and Thy most august attributes will
last. Protect it, then, from the mischief of the aggressor and the hosts
of tyranny. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Bless
Thou, also, O Lord my God, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens who have
attained unto Thee. Thou, truly, art the All-Bountiful, Whose grace is
infinite. No God is there save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most
Generous.

—Bahá’u’lláh




“He is the All-Glorious!...”


(This prayer, revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is read at His Shrine. It is also
used in private prayer.)

Whoso reciteth this prayer with lowliness and fervor will bring gladness
and joy to the heart of this Servant; it will be even as meeting Him face
to face.

He is the All-Glorious!

O God, my God! Lowly and tearful, I raise my suppliant hands to Thee and
cover my face in the dust of that Threshold of Thine, exalted above the
knowledge of the learned, and the praise of all that glorify Thee.
Graciously look upon Thy servant, humble and lowly at Thy door, with the
glances of the eye of Thy mercy, and immerse him in the Ocean of Thine
eternal grace.

Lord! He is a poor and lowly servant of Thine, enthralled and imploring
Thee, captive in Thy hand, praying fervently to Thee, trusting in Thee, in
tears before Thy face, calling to Thee and beseeching Thee, saying:

O Lord, my God! Give me Thy grace to serve Thy loved ones, strengthen me
in my servitude to Thee, illumine my brow with the light of adoration in
Thy court of holiness, and of prayer to Thy kingdom of grandeur. Help me
to be selfless at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and aid me to be
detached from all things within Thy holy precincts. Lord! Give me to drink
from the chalice of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and in its
ocean immerse me. Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, and
grant that I may offer up my soul for the earth ennobled by the footsteps
of Thy chosen ones in Thy path, O Lord of Glory in the Highest.

With this prayer doth Thy servant call Thee, at dawntide and in the
night-season. Fulfill his heart’s desire, O Lord! Illumine his heart,
gladden his bosom, kindle his light, that he may serve Thy Cause and Thy
servants.

Thou art the Bestower, the Pitiful, the Most Bountiful, the Gracious, the
Merciful, the Compassionate.

—‘Abdu’l-Bahá





INTERCALARY DAYS




“My God, my Fire and my Light! The days...”


(The Intercalary Days, February 26 to March 1, inclusive, should be days
of preparation for the Fast, days of hospitality, charity and the giving
of presents.)

My God, my Fire and my Light! The days which Thou hast named the
Ayyám-i-Há(12) in Thy Book have begun, O Thou Who art the King of names,
and the fast which Thy most exalted Pen hath enjoined unto all who are in
the kingdom of Thy creation to observe is approaching. I entreat Thee, O
my Lord, by these days and by all such as have during that period clung to
the cord of Thy commandments, and laid hold on the handle of Thy precepts,
to grant that unto every soul may be assigned a place within the precincts
of Thy court, and a seat at the revelation of the splendors of the light
of Thy countenance.

These, O my Lord, are Thy servants whom no corrupt inclination hath kept
back from what Thou didst send down in Thy Book. They have bowed
themselves before Thy Cause, and received Thy Book with such resolve as is
born of Thee, and observed what Thou hadst prescribed unto them, and
chosen to follow that which had been sent down by Thee.

Thou seest, O my Lord, how they have recognized and confessed whatsoever
Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures. Give them to drink, O my Lord, from
the hands of Thy graciousness the waters of Thine eternity. Write down,
then, for them the recompense ordained for him that hath immersed himself
in the ocean of Thy presence, and attained unto the choice wine of Thy
meeting.

I implore Thee, O Thou the King of kings and the Pitier of the
downtrodden, to ordain for them the good of this world and of the world to
come. Write down for them, moreover, what none of Thy creatures hath
discovered, and number them with those who have circled round Thee, and
who move about Thy throne in every world of Thy worlds.

Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

—Bahá’u’lláh





THE FAST


The Kitáb-i-Aqdas states: “We have commanded you to pray and fast from the
beginning of maturity [15 years]; this is ordained by God, your Lord and
the Lord of your forefathers.... The traveler, the ailing, those who are
with child or giving suck, are not bound by the fast.... Abstain from food
and drink, from sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you of
this grace that is appointed in the Book.”

The period of the Fast is March 2 through March 20.





“I BESEECH THEE, O MY GOD, BY THY MIGHTY...”


I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy mighty Sign, and by the revelation of Thy
grace amongst men, to cast me not away from the gate of the city of Thy
presence, and to disappoint not the hopes I have set on the manifestations
of Thy grace amidst Thy creatures. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great,
the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe
to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy most sweet Voice and by Thy most exalted
Word, to draw me ever nearer to the threshold of Thy door, and to suffer
me not to be far removed from the shadow of Thy mercy and the canopy of
Thy bounty. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy,
the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the
Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all
in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the splendor of Thy luminous brow and the
brightness of the light of Thy countenance, which shineth from the
all-highest horizon, to attract me by the fragrance of Thy raiment, and
make me drink of the choice wine of Thine utterance. Thou seest me, O my
God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most
Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging
to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the
world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy hair which moveth across Thy face, even
as Thy most exalted pen moveth across the pages of Thy Tablets, shedding
the musk of hidden meanings over the kingdom of Thy creation, so to raise
me up to serve Thy Cause that I shall not fall back, nor be hindered by
the suggestions of them who have caviled at Thy signs and turned away from
Thy face. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the
Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most
Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in
this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name which Thou hast made the King of
Names, by which all who are in heaven and all who are on earth have been
enraptured, to enable me to gaze on the Daystar of Thy Beauty, and to
supply me with the wine of Thine utterance. Thou seest me, O my God,
holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty,
the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the
hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to
come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Tabernacle of Thy majesty upon the
loftiest summits, and the Canopy of Thy Revelation on the highest hills,
to graciously aid me to do what Thy will hath desired and Thy purpose hath
manifested. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy,
the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the
Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all
in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Beauty that shineth forth above the
horizon of eternity, a Beauty before which as soon as it revealeth itself
the kingdom of beauty boweth down in worship, magnifying it in ringing
tones, to grant that I may die to all that I possess and live to
whatsoever belongeth unto Thee. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great,
the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe
to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Manifestation of Thy Name, the
Well-Beloved, through Whom the hearts of Thy lovers were consumed and the
souls of all that dwell on earth have soared aloft, to aid me to remember
Thee amongst Thy creatures, and to extol Thee amidst Thy people. Thou
seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous,
the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and
in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the
murmur of the breezes of Thine utterance in the kingdom of Thy names, to
remove me far from whatsoever Thy will abhorreth, and draw me nigh unto
the station wherein He Who is the Dayspring of Thy signs hath shone forth.
Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most
Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most
Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in
this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by that Letter which, as soon as it proceeded
out of the mouth of Thy will, hath caused the oceans to surge, and the
winds to blow, and the fruits to be revealed, and the trees to spring
forth, and all past traces to vanish, and all veils to be rent asunder,
and them who are devoted to Thee to hasten unto the light of the
countenance of their Lord, the Unconstrained, to make known unto me what
lay hid in the treasuries of Thy knowledge and concealed within the
repositories of Thy wisdom. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name,
the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the
Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to
which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the fire of Thy love which drove sleep from
the eyes of Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, and by their remembrance
and praise of Thee at the hour of dawn, to number me with such as have
attained unto that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book and manifested
through Thy will. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most
Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most
Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which
have clung all in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by the light of Thy countenance which impelled
them who are nigh unto Thee to meet the darts of Thy decree, and such as
are devoted to Thee to face the swords of Thine enemies in Thy path, to
write down for me with Thy most exalted Pen what Thou hast written down
for Thy trusted ones and Thy chosen ones. Thou seest me, O my God, holding
to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast hearkened
unto the call of Thy lovers, and the sighs of them that long for Thee, and
the cry of them that enjoy near access to Thee, and the groaning of them
that are devoted to Thee, and through which Thou hast fulfilled the wishes
of them that have set their hopes on Thee, and hast granted them their
desires, through Thy grace and Thy favors, and by Thy Name through which
the ocean of forgiveness surged before Thy face, and the clouds of Thy
generosity rained upon Thy servants, to write down for everyone who hath
turned unto Thee, and observed the fast prescribed by Thee, the recompense
decreed for such as speak not except by Thy leave, and who forsook all
that they possessed in Thy path and for love of Thee.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thyself, and by Thy signs, and Thy clear
tokens, and the shining light of the Daystar of Thy Beauty, and Thy
Branches, to cancel the trespasses of those who have held fast to Thy
laws, and have observed what Thou hast prescribed unto them in Thy Book.
Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most
Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most
Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in
this world and in the world to come.

—Bahá’u’lláh





“PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH...”


Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by this Revelation
whereby darkness hath been turned into light, through which the Frequented
Fane hath been built, and the Written Tablet revealed, and the Outspread
Roll uncovered, to send down upon me and upon them who are in my company
that which will enable us to soar into the heavens of Thy transcendent
glory, and will wash us from the stain of such doubts as have hindered the
suspicious from entering into the tabernacle of Thy unity.

I am the one, O my Lord, who hath held fast the cord of Thy
loving-kindness, and clung to the hem of Thy mercy and favors. Do Thou
ordain for me and for my loved ones the good of this world and of the
world to come. Supply them, then, with the Hidden Gift Thou didst ordain
for the choicest among Thy creatures.

These are, O my Lord, the days in which Thou hast bidden Thy servants to
observe the fast. Blessed is he that observeth the fast wholly for Thy
sake and with absolute detachment from all things except Thee. Assist me
and assist them, O my Lord, to obey Thee and to keep Thy precepts. Thou,
verily, hast power to do what Thou choosest.

There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All praise be to
God, the Lord of all worlds.

—Bahá’u’lláh





“THESE ARE, O MY GOD, THE DAYS WHEREON THOU...”


These are, O my God, the days whereon Thou didst enjoin Thy servants to
observe the fast. With it Thou didst adorn the preamble of the Book of Thy
Laws revealed unto Thy creatures, and didst deck forth the Repositories of
Thy commandments in the sight of all who are in Thy heaven and all who are
on Thy earth. Thou hast endowed every hour of these days with a special
virtue, inscrutable to all except Thee, Whose knowledge embraceth all
created things. Thou hast, also, assigned unto every soul a portion of
this virtue in accordance with the Tablet of Thy decree and the Scriptures
of Thine irrevocable judgment. Every leaf of these Books and Scriptures
Thou hast, moreover, allotted to each one of the peoples and kindreds of
the earth.

For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according to Thy decree, reserved, at
each daybreak, the cup of Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Ruler of
rulers! These are they who have been so inebriated with the wine of Thy
manifold wisdom that they forsake their couches in their longing to
celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy virtues, and flee from sleep in their
eagerness to approach Thy presence and partake of Thy bounty. Their eyes
have, at all times, been bent upon the Dayspring of Thy loving-kindness,
and their faces set towards the Fountainhead of Thine inspiration. Rain
down, then, upon us and upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy what
beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounteousness and grace.

Lauded be Thy name, O my God! This is the hour when Thou hast unlocked the
doors of Thy bounty before the faces of Thy creatures, and opened wide the
portals of Thy tender mercy unto all the dwellers of Thine earth. I
beseech Thee, by all them whose blood was shed in Thy path, who, in their
yearning over Thee, rid themselves from all attachment to any of Thy
creatures, and who were so carried away by the sweet savors of Thine
inspiration that every single member of their bodies intoned Thy praise
and vibrated to Thy remembrance, not to withhold from us the things Thou
hast irrevocably ordained in this Revelation—a Revelation the potency of
which hath caused every tree to cry out what the Burning Bush had
aforetime proclaimed unto Moses, Who conversed with Thee, a Revelation
that hath enabled every least pebble to resound again with Thy praise, as
the stones glorified Thee in the days of Muḥammad, Thy Friend.

These are the ones, O my God, whom Thou hast graciously enabled to have
fellowship with Thee and to commune with Him Who is the Revealer of
Thyself. The winds of Thy will have scattered them abroad until Thou didst
gather them together beneath Thy shadow, and didst cause them to enter
into the precincts of Thy court. Now that Thou hast made them to abide
under the shade of the canopy of Thy mercy, do Thou assist them to attain
what must befit so august a station. Suffer them not, O my Lord, to be
numbered with them who, though enjoying near access to Thee, have been
kept back from recognizing Thy face, and who, though meeting with Thee,
are deprived of Thy presence.

These are Thy servants, O my Lord, who have entered with Thee in this, the
Most Great Prison, who have kept the fast within its walls according to
what Thou hast commanded them in the Tablets of Thy decree and the Books
of Thy behest. Send down, therefore, upon them what will thoroughly purge
them of all that Thou abhorrest, that they may be wholly devoted to Thee,
and may detach themselves entirely from all except Thyself.

Rain down, then, upon us, O my God, that which beseemeth Thy grace and
befitteth Thy bounty. Enable us, then, O my God, to live in remembrance of
Thee and to die in love of Thee, and supply us with the gift of Thy
presence in Thy worlds hereafter—worlds which are inscrutable to all
except Thee. Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and the God of
all that are in heaven and all that are on earth.

Thou beholdest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy dear ones in Thy days.
Thy glory beareth me witness! The voice of the lamentation of Thy chosen
ones hath been lifted up throughout Thy realm. Some were ensnared by the
infidels in Thy land, and were hindered by them from having near access to
Thee and from attaining the court of Thy glory. Others were able to
approach Thee, but were kept back from beholding Thy face. Still others
were permitted, in their eagerness to look upon Thee, to enter the
precincts of Thy court, but they allowed the veils of the imaginations of
Thy creatures and the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors among Thy people
to come in between them and Thee.

This is the hour, O my Lord, which Thou hast caused to excel every other
hour, and hast related to the choicest among Thy creatures. I beseech
Thee, O my God, by Thy Self and by them, to ordain in the course of this
year what shall exalt Thy loved ones. Do Thou, moreover, decree within
this year what will enable the Daystar of Thy power to shine brightly
above the horizon of Thy glory, and to illuminate by Thy sovereign might,
the whole world.

Render Thy Cause victorious, O my Lord, and abase Thou Thine enemies.
Write down, then, for us the good of this life and of the life to come.
Thou art the Truth, Who knoweth the secret things. No God is there but
Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

—Bahá’u’lláh





“GLORY BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! THESE ARE...”


Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! These are the days whereon Thou hast
bidden all men to observe the fast, that through it they may purify their
souls and rid themselves of all attachment to anyone but Thee, and that
out of their hearts may ascend that which will be worthy of the court of
Thy majesty and may well beseem the seat of the revelation of Thy oneness.
Grant, O my Lord, that this fast may become a river of life-giving waters
and may yield the virtue wherewith Thou hast endowed it. Cleanse Thou by
its means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils of the world have
failed to hinder from turning towards Thine all-glorious Name, and who
have remained unmoved by the noise and tumult of such as have repudiated
Thy most resplendent signs which have accompanied the advent of Thy
Manifestation Whom Thou hast invested with Thy sovereignty, Thy power, Thy
majesty and glory. These are the servants who, as soon as Thy call reached
them, hastened in the direction of Thy mercy and were not kept back from
Thee by the changes and chances of this world or by any human limitations.

I am he, O my God, who testifieth to Thy unity, who acknowledgeth Thy
oneness, who boweth humbly before the revelations of Thy majesty, and who
recognizeth with downcast countenance the splendors of the light of Thy
transcendent glory. I have believed in Thee after Thou didst enable me to
know Thy Self, Whom Thou hast revealed to men’s eyes through the power of
Thy sovereignty and might. Unto Him I have turned, wholly detached from
all things, and cleaving steadfastly unto the cord of Thy gifts and
favors. I have embraced His truth, and the truth of all the wondrous laws
and precepts that have been sent down unto Him. I have fasted for love of
Thee and in pursuance of Thine injunction, and have broken my fast with
Thy praise on my tongue and in conformity with Thy pleasure. Suffer me
not, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have fasted in the daytime,
who in the night-season have prostrated themselves before Thy face, and
who have repudiated Thy truth, disbelieved in Thy signs, gainsaid Thy
testimony, and perverted Thine utterances.

Open Thou, O my Lord, mine eyes and the eyes of all them that have sought
Thee, that we may recognize Thee with Thine own eyes. This is Thy bidding
given us in the Book sent down by Thee unto Him Whom Thou hast chosen by
Thy behest, Whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favor above all Thy
creatures, Whom Thou hast been pleased to invest with Thy sovereignty, and
Whom Thou hast specially favored and entrusted with Thy Message unto Thy
people. Praised be Thou, therefore, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast
graciously enabled us to recognize Him and to acknowledge whatsoever hath
been sent down unto Him, and conferred upon us the honor of attaining the
presence of the One Whom Thou didst promise in Thy Book and in Thy
Tablets.

Thou seest me then, O my God, with my face turned towards Thee, cleaving
steadfastly to the cord of Thy gracious providence and generosity, and
clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies and bountiful favors. Destroy
not, I implore Thee, my hopes of attaining unto that which Thou didst
ordain for Thy servants who have turned towards the precincts of Thy court
and the sanctuary of Thy presence, and have observed the fast for love of
Thee. I confess, O my God, that whatever proceedeth from me is wholly
unworthy of Thy sovereignty and falleth short of Thy majesty. And yet I
beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast revealed Thy Self, in the
glory of Thy most excellent titles, unto all created things, in this
Revelation whereby Thou hast, through Thy most resplendent Name,
manifested Thy beauty, to give me to drink of the wine of Thy mercy and of
the pure beverage of Thy favor, which have streamed forth from the right
hand of Thy will, that I may so fix my gaze upon Thee and be so detached
from all else but Thee, that the world and all that hath been created
therein may appear before me as a fleeting day which Thou hast not deigned
to create.

I moreover entreat Thee, O my God, to rain down, from the heaven of Thy
will and the clouds of Thy mercy, that which will cleanse us from the
noisome savors of our transgressions, O Thou Who hast called Thyself the
God of Mercy! Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the
Beneficent.

Cast not away, O my Lord, him that hath turned towards Thee, nor suffer
him who hath drawn nigh unto Thee to be removed far from Thy court. Dash
not the hopes of the suppliant who hath longingly stretched out his hands
to seek Thy grace and favors, and deprive not Thy sincere servants of the
wonders of Thy tender mercies and loving-kindness. Forgiving and Most
Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord! Power hast Thou to do what Thou pleasest.
All else but Thee are impotent before the revelations of Thy might, are as
lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth, are as nothing when
compared with the manifestations of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and are
destitute of all strength when face to face with the signs and tokens of
Thy power. What refuge is there beside Thee, O my Lord, to which I can
flee, and where is there a haven to which I can hasten? Nay, the power of
Thy might beareth me witness! No protector is there but Thee, no place to
flee to except Thee, no refuge to seek save Thee. Cause me to taste, O my
Lord, the divine sweetness of Thy remembrance and praise. I swear by Thy
might! Whosoever tasteth of its sweetness will rid himself of all
attachment to the world and all that is therein, and will set his face
towards Thee, cleansed from the remembrance of anyone except Thee.

Inspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy wondrous remembrance, that I may
glorify Thy name. Number me not with them who read Thy words and fail to
find Thy hidden gift which, as decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and
which quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the hearts of Thy
servants. Cause me, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have been so
stirred up by the sweet savors that have been wafted in Thy days that they
have laid down their lives for Thee and hastened to the scene of their
death in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty and in their yearning to
attain Thy presence. And were anyone to say unto them on their way,
“Whither go ye?” they would say, “Unto God, the All-Possessing, the Help
in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!”

The transgressions committed by such as have turned away from Thee and
have borne themselves haughtily towards Thee have not availed to hinder
them from loving Thee, and from setting their faces towards Thee, and from
turning in the direction of Thy mercy. These are they who are blessed by
the Concourse on high, who are glorified by the denizens of the
everlasting Cities, and beyond them by those on whose foreheads Thy most
exalted pen hath written: “These! The people of Bahá. Through them have
been shed the splendors of the light of guidance.” Thus hath it been
ordained, at Thy behest and by Thy will, in the Tablet of Thine
irrevocable decree.

Proclaim, therefore, O my God, their greatness and the greatness of those
who while living or after death have circled round them. Supply them with
that which Thou hast ordained for the righteous among Thy creatures.
Potent art Thou to do all things. There is no God but Thee, the
All-Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.

Do not bring our fasts to an end with this fast, O my Lord, nor the
covenants Thou hast made with this covenant. Do Thou accept all that we
have done for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and all that
we have left undone as a result of our subjection to our evil and corrupt
desires. Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy good
pleasure, and preserve us from the mischief of such as have denied Thee
and repudiated Thy most resplendent signs. Thou art, in truth, the Lord of
this world and of the next. No God is there beside Thee, the Exalted, the
Most High.

Magnify Thou, O Lord my God, Him Who is the Primal Point, the Divine
Mystery, the Unseen Essence, the Dayspring of Divinity, and the
Manifestation of Thy Lordship, through Whom all the knowledge of the past
and all the knowledge of the future were made plain, through Whom the
pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were uncovered, and the mystery of Thy
treasured name disclosed, Whom Thou hast appointed as the Announcer of the
One through Whose name the letter B and the letter E have been joined and
united, through Whom Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty and Thy might were made
known, through Whom Thy words have been sent down, Thy laws set forth with
clearness, and Thy signs spread abroad, and Thy Word established, through
Whom the hearts of Thy chosen ones were laid bare, and all that were in
the heavens and all that were on the earth were gathered together, Whom
Thou has called ‘Alí-Muḥammad in the kingdom of Thy names, and the Spirit
of Spirits in the Tablets of Thine irrevocable decree, Whom Thou hast
invested with Thine own title, unto Whose name all other names have, at
Thy bidding and through the power of Thy might, been made to return, and
in Whom Thou hast caused all Thine attributes and titles to attain their
final consummation. To Him also belong such names as lay hid within Thy
stainless tabernacles, in Thine invisible world and Thy sanctified cities.

Magnify Thou, moreover, such as have believed in Him and in His signs and
have turned towards Him, from among those that have acknowledged Thy unity
in His Latter Manifestation—a Manifestation whereof He hath made mention
in His Tablets, and in His Books, and in His Scriptures, and in all the
wondrous verses and gem-like utterances that have descended upon Him. It
is this same Manifestation Whose covenant Thou hast bidden Him establish
ere He had established His own covenant. He it is Whose praise the Bayán
hath celebrated. In it His excellence hath been extolled, and His truth
established, and His sovereignty proclaimed, and His Cause perfected.
Blessed is the man that hath turned unto Him, and fulfilled the things He
hath commanded, O Thou Who art the Lord of the worlds and the Desire of
all them that have known Thee!

Praised be Thou, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast aided us to recognize and
love Him. I, therefore, beseech Thee by Him and by Them who are the
Daysprings of Thy Divinity, and the Manifestations of Thy Lordship, and
the Treasuries of Thy Revelation, and the Depositories of Thine
inspiration, to enable us to serve and obey Him, and to empower us to
become the helpers of His Cause and the dispersers of His adversaries.
Powerful art Thou to do all that pleaseth Thee. No God is there beside
Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all
men!

—Bahá’u’lláh





NAW-RÚZ




“Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast...”


(Naw-Rúz, March 21, is the first day of the Bahá’í year.)

Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast ordained Naw-Rúz as a festival
unto those who have observed the fast for love of Thee and abstained from
all that is abhorrent unto Thee. Grant, O my Lord, that the fire of Thy
love and the heat produced by the fast enjoined by Thee may inflame them
in Thy Cause, and make them to be occupied with Thy praise and with
remembrance of Thee.

Since Thou hast adorned them, O my Lord, with the ornament of the fast
prescribed by Thee, do Thou adorn them also with the ornament of Thine
acceptance, through Thy grace and bountiful favor. For the doings of men
are all dependent upon Thy good pleasure, and are conditioned by Thy
behest. Shouldst Thou regard him who hath broken the fast as one who hath
observed it, such a man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had
been keeping the fast. And shouldst Thou decree that he who hath observed
the fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered with such as have
caused the Robe of Thy Revelation to be stained with dust, and been far
removed from the crystal waters of this living Fountain.

Thou art He through Whom the ensign “Praiseworthy art Thou in Thy works”
hath been lifted up, and the standard “Obeyed art Thou in Thy behest” hath
been unfurled. Make known this Thy station, O my God, unto Thy servants,
that they may be made aware that the excellence of all things is dependent
upon Thy bidding and Thy word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned
by Thy leave and the good pleasure of Thy will, and may recognize that the
reins of men’s doings are within the grasp of Thine acceptance and Thy
commandment. Make this known unto them, that nothing whatsoever may shut
them out from Thy Beauty, in these days whereon the Christ exclaimeth:
“All dominion is Thine, O Thou the Begetter of the Spirit (Jesus)”; and
Thy Friend (Muḥammad) crieth out: “Glory be to Thee, O Thou the
Best-Beloved, for that Thou hast uncovered Thy Beauty, and written down
for Thy chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto the seat of the
revelation of Thy Most Great Name, through which all the peoples have
lamented except such as have detached themselves from all else except
Thee, and set themselves towards Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and
the Manifestation of Thine attributes.”

He Who is Thy Branch and all Thy company, O my Lord, have broken this day
their fast, after having observed it within the precincts of Thy court,
and in their eagerness to please Thee. Do Thou ordain for Him, and for
them, and for all such as have entered Thy presence in those days all the
good Thou didst destine in Thy Book. Supply them, then, with that which
will profit them, in both this life and in the life beyond.

Thou, in truth, art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

MARTYRS AND THEIR FAMILIES




“He is God! O Lord my God! O Thou Helper of the...”


He is God!

O Lord my God! O Thou Helper of the feeble, Succorer of the poor and
Deliverer of the helpless who turn unto Thee.

With utmost lowliness I raise my suppliant hands to Thy kingdom of beauty
and fervently call upon Thee with my inner tongue, saying: O God, my God!
Aid me to adore Thee, strengthen my loins to serve Thee; assist me by Thy
grace in my servitude to Thee; suffer me to remain steadfast in my
obedience to Thee; pour forth upon me the liberal effusions of Thy bounty,
let the glances of the eye of Thy loving-kindness be directed towards me,
and immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Grant that I may be
confirmed in my allegiance to Thy Faith, and bestow upon me a fuller
measure of certitude and assurance, that I may wholly dispense with the
world, may turn my face with entire devotion towards Thy face, be
reinforced by the compelling power of proofs and testimonies, and,
invested with majesty and power, may pass beyond every region of heaven
and earth. Verily Thou art the Merciful, the All-Glorious, the Kind, the
Compassionate.

O Lord! These are the survivors of the martyrs, that company of blessed
souls. They have sustained every tribulation and displayed patience in the
face of grievous injustice. They have forsaken all comfort and prosperity,
have willingly submitted to dire suffering and adversity in the path of
Thy love, and are still held captive in the clutches of their enemies who
continually torment them with sore torment, and oppress them because they
walk steadfastly in Thy straight path. There is no one to help them, no
one to befriend them. Apart from the ignoble and the wicked, there is no
one to associate and consort with them.

O Lord! These souls have tasted bitter agony in this earthly life and
have, as a sign of their love for the shining beauty of Thy countenance
and in their eagerness to attain Thy celestial kingdom, tolerated every
gross indignity that the people of tyranny have inflicted upon them.

O Lord! Fill their ears with the verses of divine assistance and of a
speedy victory, and deliver them from the oppression of such as wield
terrible might. Withhold the hands of the wicked and leave not these souls
to be torn by the claws and teeth of fierce beasts, for they are
captivated by their love for Thee, entrusted with the mysteries of Thy
holiness, stand humbly at Thy door and have attained to Thine exalted
precinct.

O Lord! Graciously reinforce them with a new spirit; illumine their eyes
by enabling them to behold Thy wondrous evidences in the gloom of night;
destine for them all good that aboundeth in Thy Kingdom of eternal
mysteries; make them as brilliant stars shining over all regions,
luxuriant trees laden with fruit and branches moving in the breezes of
dawn.

Verily, Thou are the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, the
Unconstrained. There is none other God but Thee, the God of love and
tender mercy, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.

“O God, my God! I implore Thee with a throbbing...”


O God, my God! I implore Thee with a throbbing heart and streaming tears
to aid whosoever expendeth his energy for the erection of this House, and
the construction of this Building wherein Thy name is mentioned every morn
and every eve.

O God! Send down Thy divine increase on whosoever endeavoreth to serve
this edifice and exerteth himself to raise it amongst the kindreds and
religions of the world. Confirm him in every good deed in promoting the
welfare of mankind. Open Thou the doors of wealth and abundance unto him
and make him an heir to the treasures of the Kingdom, which perish not.
Make him a sign of Thy bestowals among the peoples and reinforce him by
the sea of Thy generosity and bounty, surging with waves of Thy grace and
favor. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Merciful and the Bountiful.

incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk

           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

      General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
