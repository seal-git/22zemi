NOTICE.


OWING to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred Neat
Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as
widely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the
various classes of stock to hold open their books, and the delays
incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a
long correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from
furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee in season to have the
work finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records
perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed
this has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here
recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.

SHORT HORNS.


THE pure, improved Short Horn, having become an established variety of
Neat Stock for useful and farm purposes throughout the Northern and
Western States, and proved themselves to be all that can reasonably be
expected of them when established on soil productive of an abundance of
grass, it is desirable to preserve their blood as pure as possible, and
the animals herein inserted have had their pedigrees examined and
approved by the Committee appointed for that purpose. It must be
admitted that the Short Horns present themselves to notice under
circumstances of peculiar interest; possessing in themselves a
combination of desirable qualities, and rendered attractive to the eye
by their splendid frames, and beautiful varied colors, it is not
surprising they have become objects of public interest. Great temptation
is laid before a class of men to manufacture _pure bloods_ to suit their
purposes, being able to afford them at a much less price than a genuine
article. Great facilities are within the reach of all at the present
day, who desire to become acquainted with their history and their great
performance at the shambles, and for the dairy, and general usefulness
as farm stock.

The beef producers, and beef dealers uniformly acknowledge their great
superiority over common stock. In the month of November, 1817, the
improved Durham Short Horn Bull, Young Denton, (963) then sixteen months
old, arrived in Boston, sent out from England by Samuel Williams, of
London, a present to his brother Stephen Williams, of Northboro',
Worcester Co., Mass.; he remained there until 1827 or 1828, when he was
taken to the State of Maine, where he died, April 16, 1830. His Sire was
Denton, (198); his G. Sire Comet, (155); was sold for 1000 guineas in
1810. In 1822, Mr. Williams received the Short Horn Cow, Arabella, from
the same source; her Sire was North Star, (460); Dam, Aurora by Comet,
(155). Both of these animals were bred by that eminent breeder, John
Wetherel, who was one of the four spirited purchasers of Comet (155) in
1810, at the price before mentioned. It has been claimed by those who
have gone before us, that Young Denton (963) was the first improved
Durham Short Horn Bull, imported into the United States. From these two
imported animals sprang a very numerous progeny, and their descendants
are scattered through all of the Northern States. In 1823 the Bull
Admiral, (1608) and Cow Arabella, were sent out from the same herd as a
present from Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, to the Massachusetts Agricultural
Society, who placed them under the charge of E. Hersey Derby, Esq., of
Salem, Mass., who bred from them successfully a few years, when the
stock on hand was sold and removed to Hartford Co., Conn. Many animals
of the present day, trace back to this importation. About the same
period, Israel Monson, Esq., of Boston, a large landholder, brought out
the Cow, Tube Rose, also from the herd of Mr. Wetherel. She produced but
one Heifer in this country, (Rose by Young Denton), which, with her
Mother and Daughter, (Nellie by Admiral, (1608)) died about the year
1830.

In 1823. Mr. John S. Skinner, then editor of the American Farmer,
Baltimore, imported two Heifers, Conquest and Pansey, and a Bull,
Washington, (1566) for Gen. Stephen Van Renselaer, of Albany, N. Y., all
from the herd of Mr. Champion, Blythe, England. Many of their
descendants are recorded in this book, and are scattered through all the
Northern States. All of the above mentioned animals possessed a very
high order of excellence for milking capacity, both quality and
quantity, and their descendants maintain that character in a very high
degree at the present day.

In 1829, Mr. Benjamin Rodman, of New Bedford, Mass., imported three
Heifers, Adaliza, Dulcibella, and Galatea, and a Bull, Devonshire,
(966) bred by Mr. Whitaker, of Burley, Yorkshire,--these were selected
by Mr. Francis Rotch, then in England. One of them, Dulcibella was in
calf when purchased, and produced Dew Drop, by Charles, (878) from which
has sprung a numerous family of Cows, celebrated for their superior
dairy qualities.

In 1830, Mr. Enoch Silsby, of Boston, Mass., sent to England and brought
out the Cow, Boston, by Sir Charles, (1440) and Bull, Boston, (1735)
both bred by Mr. Curry, of Brandon. These animals left a numerous
progeny, justly celebrated for strong constitutions as well as rich
handling and dairy qualities; many of their descendants are also
recorded in this book.

It is not claimed the instances of Short Horn excellence herein cited
are superior to many others; they are those that have been noted and the
facts made public.


_Beef Qualities._

In 1843 a thorough bred Heifer, Regina, three years and a half old,
having nursed her calf through the summer, was in thin flesh in the
fall. Her bag having been deformed by accident, and she not being in
calf, was put into a distillery stall in November, fed on slops and
straw, and slaughtered in April following, and her dressed weight, beef,
hide and tallow, 1005 pounds; beef of the finest quality.

In 1857, Lucy, a thorough bred Heifer, was turned to pasture with
reference to making beef of her, she having proved barren, being then
nearly four years old. She was put into the stable in November, fed on
good hay and a very small quantity of meal, it being the design to feed
her a long time. On the fourth day of January following she was sold to
a butcher for ten dollars per cwt., estimated at 1,000 pounds. She was
slaughtered at Hartford, Conn., being four years and five months old,
having eaten less than _two bushels_ of meal in her life. Her beef was
sold, all the prime pieces at twenty-five cents per pound; was a very
beautiful animal, with handling properties of the very highest order of
excellence.

In the month of January, 1862, Pocahontas, a thorough bred Heifer, was
sold and slaughtered, then five years and one month old. Her dressed
weight was as follows: hide, ninety pounds; tallow, one hundred and
twenty-seven pounds; quarters, eleven hundred and eighteen pounds; total
dressed weight, thirteen hundred and thirty-five pounds; was sold for
eight cents per pound, making $106.80. Her feed, other than hay and
grass, being twenty and one-half bushels of meal in all.


_Dairy Qualities._

Lucilla, a thorough bred Heifer, at four years old, gave in June
fifty-five pounds of milk on an average for one month; her greatest
yield in one day was fifty-nine pounds and eight ounces, and during this
month yielded fourteen pounds and eight ounces of butter in one week;
her feed, grass, with three quarts of meal daily. At five years old the
first week in June, her milk yielded fifteen pounds three ounces of
butter, on grass only.

Dorothy, a thorough bred Cow, gave thirty-nine pounds eight ounces of
milk per day, three months after calving, on grass only; and in seven
days made fifteen pounds one ounce of butter, in October.

Nymph 5th, in the month of June, 1860, gave twenty-four quarts of milk
daily for two weeks in succession, and made butter at the rate of two
pounds four ounces per day, or fifteen pounds three ounces per week, on
grass only.

Rose 2d, a thorough bred Cow, produced seventeen pounds four ounces of
butter from one week's milk in June, on grass only.


_Longevity._

Princess, a thorough bred Cow, bred regularly up to eighteen years old;
was then dried off and turned to grass for beef, and slaughtered in the
fall without stall-feeding, and made merchantable beef.

Arabella, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to seventeen years old,
and died in 1861, at eighteen years old.

Lilac 4th, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to nineteen years old,
and died in 1861.

NOTICE.


OWING to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred Neat
Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as
widely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the
various classes of stock to hold open their books and the delays
incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a
long correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from
furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee, in season to have the
work finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records
perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed
this has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here
recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.

PREFACE.


THE Committee appointed to examine and prepare for publication pedigrees
of Ayrshire Stock, having completed their labors, offer the following as
their Report.

In arranging the pedigrees, we have endeavored to render them simple and
exact, and to trace each animal to a direct importation. In a few
instances this latter has been impossible, and we have been obliged to
be content with tracing the pedigrees to the herds of well known
breeders, having their assurances that the animals in question were
thorough-bred Ayrshire.

Many breeders, who have taken the utmost pains, and have been at great
expense to keep their herds pure, have not been careful to keep accurate
records of the pedigrees of their stock, feeling that as long as they
themselves were satisfied, their assurances would be sufficient to
convince purchasers. This course answered when there were but few cattle
of this breed in the country, and the necessity of an organized effort
to preserve the purity of the blood had not been recognized; but
hereafter it is hoped that every one liberal enough to breed
thorough-bred stock, will see the advantages and the necessity of a
record of pedigrees, and assist in swelling the next edition of the
work, to a size more nearly commensurate with the importance of the
subject.

The Committee thought best to have a short history of the Ayrshires,
together with the points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural
Association, printed as an introduction to the work, and applied to
Sanford Howard, Esq., of Boston, who kindly consented to write such an
article.

Mr. Howard's opportunities of studying this breed, both in Scotland and
in this country have been such, that he is eminently fitted to write
with authority on the subject. The Committee did not follow his
suggestion and give in the Herd Book the lists of premiums taken by the
animals at the various Agricultural Fairs, knowing that many of the
premiums in this country have been awarded for want of competition, and
by judges not acquainted with the excellencies or the peculiarities of
the breed. Should this Society ever hold exhibitions, a record of the
premiums taken at them would be of great value to breeders in selecting
animals for stock purposes.

INTRODUCTION.


THE breed of cattle now know as the Ayrshire, undoubtedly originated in
the county of that name, in Scotland; but by what special means it was
formed cannot be particularly told. Youatt (1835) says, "A century ago
there was no such breed in Ayrshire or in Scotland;" and he asks, "Did
the [present] Ayrshire cattle arise entirely from a careful selection of
the native breed?" adding, "If they did it is a circumstance
unparalleled in the history of agriculture. The native breed may be
ameliorated by careful selection; its value may be incalculably
increased; some good qualities may for the first time be developed; but
yet there will be some resemblance to the original stock." A comparison
of the modern breed with the description given by Aiton of the cattle
which he says occupied Ayrshire fifty years before the time when he
wrote (1806), will show that the difference is great. He says, "The cows
kept in the districts of Kyle and Cunningham [districts of Ayrshire],
were of a diminutive size, ill-fed, ill-shaped, and they yielded but a
scanty return in milk; they were mostly of a black color, with stripes
of white along the chine or ridge of their backs, about their flanks and
on their faces. Their horns were high and crooked, * * * their pile
[hair] was coarse and open; and few of them yielded more than three or
four Scotch pints [six to eight wine quarts] of milk a day."

Those who are acquainted with the Ayrshire cattle of to-day, will
readily admit that they present a wide contrast with the old stock,
according to the above description of the latter; and the suggestion of
Youatt, that the present breed could not have arisen entirely by
selection from the old, seems reasonable. It follows, then, that the
Ayrshire, like the modern or "improved" Short Horn breed, originated in
crossing. The question as to the breeds from which it was derived, will
be briefly considered, although the attempt will not be made to give
precise details on this point.

Various accounts represent that the Earl of Marchmont, some time between
1724 and 1740, introduced to his estates, in Berwickshire, some cattle,
conjectured (their history was not positively known) to be of the
Holderness or Teeswater breed, and that, not long afterwards, some of
the stock was carried to estates belonging to the same nobleman, in that
part of Ayrshire called Kyle. But, perhaps, the main nucleus of the
improved breed was the "Dunlop stock," so called, which appears to have
been possessed by a distinguished family by the name of Dunlop, in the
Cunningham District of Ayrshire, as early as 1780. This stock, it is
said, was derived, at least in part, from animals imported from Holland.
The Dunlop cows soon became noted. Rawlin (as quoted by Youatt), who
wrote in 1794, speaking of the cattle of Ayrshire, says, "They have
another breed, called the Dunlop, which are allowed to be the best race
for yielding milk in Great Britain, or Ireland, not only for large
quantities, but also for richness and quality." This, though extravagant
praise, perhaps, shows that the stock possessed remarkable qualities at
that early day. It was, indeed, held in great esteem still earlier. In
Youatt's Treatise, it is mentioned, when speaking of the cattle of
Dumfrieshire, that the poet Burns, when he occupied a farm near the city
of Dumfries, "not content with the Galloway breed, introduced some of
the West-Country cows, which he thought would produce more milk." In
the poet's published correspondence, allusion is made, in a letter dated
November 13th, 1788, to a heifer which had been presented to him by the
proprietor of Dunlop House, as "the finest quey in Ayrshire." Mrs.
Dunlop, it will be remembered, was a special friend and correspondent of
the poet.[A]

Col. Le Couteur, in a paper on the Jersey or Alderney cow, published in
the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, refers to a statement by
Quayle, that the Ayrshire was a cross of the Short Horn and Alderney;
and adds himself that "there is a considerable affinity between the two
breeds." Rawlin also says, in reference to the Ayrshire breed, "It is
said to be a mixture by bulls brought from the island of Alderney, with
their own or the old race of cows." Martin says, "At some period or
other there has evidently been a cross with the Durham or Holderness,
and, perhaps, also with the Alderney." Professor Low, in his
"Illustrations of British Quadrupeds," says, "From all the evidence
which, in the absence of authentic documents, the case admits of, the
dairy breed of Ayrshire cows, owes the characters which distinguish it
from the older race, to a mixture of the blood of the races of the
continent and of the dairy breed of Alderney."

So far, the authorities quoted have, doubtless, given the main facts in
regard to the originals of the present Ayrshire cattle. But there is
evidence that the present leading type of the breed was formed, in part,
by an infusion of the blood of the Kyloe, or West-Highland breed. This
appeared in the first instance, probably, in what has been called the
Swinley variety. The facts, which the writer has obtained in Scotland in
regard to it, are substantially as follows: Theophilus Parton, of
Swinley Farm, near Dairy, Ayrshire, about forty to forty-five years ago,
took great pains to establish a herd of what were deemed the _best_
Ayrshire cattle, into which he infused a strain of the West-Highland
blood, the particular degree of which is not publicly or generally
known. The Swinley stock differs from the older Ayrshire in having a
shorter head, with more breadth across the eyes, more upright and
spreading horns, more hair, and generally better constitutions. They are
also somewhat smaller boned than the old stock, though from their
superior symmetry, and greater tendency to fatten, they are fully equal
to the former in weight of carcass when slaughtered.

The following points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural Association,
1853, "as indicating superior quality," will give an idea of the
standard for Ayrshire cattle, as recognized by the leading breeders:

Head short, forehead wide, nose fine between the muzzle and the eyes;
muzzle moderately large, eyes full and lively, horns widely set on,
inclining upwards and curving slightly inwards.

Neck long and straight from the head to the top of the shoulders, free
from loose skin on the underside, fine at its junction with the head,
and the muscles symmetrically enlarging towards the shoulders.

Shoulders thin at the top, brisket light, the whole fore-quarter thin in
front and gradually increasing in depth and width backwards.

Back short and straight, spine well defined, especially at the
shoulders, short ribs arched, the body deep at the flanks, and the
milk-veins well developed.

Pelvis long, broad and straight, hook [or hip] bones wide apart, and not
much overlaid with fat, thighs deep and broad, tail long and slender,
and set on a level with the back.

Milk-vessel [udder] capacious and extending well forward, hinder-part
broad and firmly attached to the body, the sole or under surface nearly
level. The teats from two to two and a half inches in length, equal in
thickness, and hanging perpendicularly; their distance apart at the
sides should be equal to about one-third the length of the vessel, and
across to about one-half the breadth.

Legs short, the bones fine and the joints firm.

Skin soft and elastic, and covered with soft, close and woolly hair.

The colors preferred are brown, or brown and white, the colors being
distinctly defined. Weight of the animal, when fattened, about forty
imperial stones, sinking the offal [that is 560 pounds], the quarters or
meat only.

From what has already been said, it will be understood, that the dairy
is the leading object with the breeders of Ayrshires. At the same time
the fact has not been overlooked, that to breed and perpetuate a
profitable dairy stock, regard must be had to hardiness and strength of
constitution, and also to such fattening tendencies as will insure a
profitable return from calves fattened for veal, from steers reared for
beef, and for cows, which having served their turn in the dairy, are at
last dried of their milk and prepared for the shambles. The importance
of these properties is not sufficiently regarded by keepers of dairy
stock in this country. The remark has not unfrequently been heard that
the "_looks_ of a cow are nothing." People who hold this absurd notion
will never be distinguished for breeding profitable dairy stock. Even if
milk were the sole object, it would be impossible to preserve a breed
possessing superior qualities, in this respect, without giving attention
to those points of form which denote strength of constitution. It has
been well observed by Magne, that in the breeding of dairy stock, we
should "make choice only of animals possessing the _two-fold character
of general vigor, and activity of the mammary system_."

The leading breeders of Ayrshire, in Scotland, have followed these
principles to some extent, if not to the full degree to which they
should be observed. Hence, they claim a high rank for the breed in
reference to general usefulness. Aiton, speaking of what the Ayrshire
cow would do, says, "She yields much milk, and that of an oily or
butyraceous, or caseous nature, and after she has yielded very large
quantities of milk for several years, she shall be as valuable for beef
as any other breed of cows known; her fat shall be much more mixed
through the whole flesh, and she shall fatten faster than any other."
Whatever may be said in regard to the extent of these claims, it will be
admitted that they indicate the confidence which was long ago placed in
the breed in regard to the properties mentioned. Youatt, who wrote
twenty-five years after Aiton, says, "The breed has been much improved
since Mr. Aiton described it." It is thirty years since Mr. Youatt made
this remark, and in this time the breed has been still further improved
in reference to general usefulness. I have been assured by some of the
most experienced breeders in Scotland, that while nothing has been lost
on the score of dairy properties, considerable has been gained in
hardiness and thrift, and in the faculty of giving a greater return,
both in milk and flesh, for the food consumed. Of course it is the
return obtained in proportion to the food eaten, that constitutes the
true criterion of value in all animals.

In Scotland, the calves of the Ayrshire breed, that are not wanted for
keeping up the breeding or dairy stock, are either fattened for veal, or
turned for beef at an early age. The larger portion, perhaps, of the
males are killed for veal. In fact, in some districts, veal is an
article of considerable importance, and the ability of Ayrshire cows to
make fat calves is considered one of the excellencies of the breed. Thus
Haxton observes, "For all medium soils and climates throughout the
United Kingdom, there is no breed equal to the Ayrshire, for profit,
whether the produce is converted into cheese, butter, or _veal_." A
portion of the males are castrated and fattened when about three to
three and half years old. Scotch farmers, who are in the practice of
fattening stock of various breeds, assured me that Ayrshire steers of
this age fattened to as much profit as any, reaching the weight of 700
to 800 pounds the four quarters, and afforded beef excelled in quality
only by the Galloways and the West-Highlanders.

At present the Ayrshire cattle have not been tried in America to a great
extent. There have been various importations, mostly made within the
last twenty years, and so far as there have been such trials as would
justify a conclusion in regard to their merits, they have answered all
reasonable expectations. The leading object in keeping them here is the
same as it is in Scotland--the dairy--but their ability to fatten
readily and make beef of good quality, should be taken into
consideration in estimating their value. In regard to the latter
property, but few trials have as yet been made here. Most of the males
have been kept for bulls, and the females have seldom been fattened till
too far advanced in years to breed. It may be worthy of consideration,
whether it would not be an object to give some good steers of the breed
a fair chance to show what they could make in beef at three to four
years old.

It is also desirable to ascertain what are the capabilities of the breed
in regard to the performance of labor. On this point we are without any
evidence from abroad, as oxen are not worked in Scotland. The results of
the few trials that have been made with full-bloods, have been highly
favorable in reference to the qualities of the breed for this purpose.
Judging by their points, there is no reason why Ayrshire oxen should not
be equal to any others, of their size, for any kind of labor. They have
clean, firm legs, well-placed muscles, and are remarkably quick walkers.

The advantages of a Registry, or Herd Book, for this breed of cattle,
are too obvious to require argument. For the Short Horns, Herefords, and
Devons, registers have been prepared, and the benefits which have been
derived therefrom are such as will insure their continuance. An accurate
record of the pedigrees of animals, together with a record of such
premiums as they may have taken, cannot fail to afford a guide, to some
extent, in breeding with reference to special objects--the principle,
that "Like begets Like," being admitted as a general law. The subject of
publishing a Herd Book for Ayrshires, in Scotland, has been agitated on
several occasions, but, down to the present time, no direct action has
been taken on it. The enterprise of the American breeders of this
variety of cattle, in taking the lead in this matter, is highly
creditable, and, if properly followed up, will be sure to bring a just
recompense of reward.

FOOTNOTE:

[A] As a further explanation of the preference given by Burns for the
"West-Country cows," the writer would mention, that in 1858, he had
several interviews with the poet's sister, the late Mrs. Begg, of Ayr,
in one of which, she stated that her brother, during his occupancy of
the farm of Ellisland, near Dumfries, kept a dairy, and made
considerable quantities of cheese. Thus his efforts to procure the
Ayrshire cow, shows that they had, even at that time, a high reputation
for this object.

NOTICE.


OWING to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred Neat
Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as
widely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the
various classes of stock to hold open their books and the delays
incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a
long correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from
furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee, in season to have the
work finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records
perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed
this has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here
recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.

HISTORY OF THE DEVONS.


_Ancient Races._

IN preparing the following article, we have consulted the principal
Agricultural Reports and Journals of this country, and Youatt, and
Martin, and Low's histories of British Cattle; we are also indebted to
many of our importers and breeders, who have furnished statements in
regard to their respective herds. That the Devons are an ancient race of
cattle, there can be no doubt. There is no race in England that can
claim such undisputed antiquity. They bear all the characteristic marks
of resemblance of the ancient races of the south of England and Wales;
even the color, red, is traced in the Devon, Sussex and Hereford.

The distinction between a "breed" and "race," Goodale defines as
follows: "By breeds are understood such varieties as were originally
produced by a cross or mixture, and subsequently established by
selecting for breeding purposes only the best specimens, and rejecting
all others. In process of time deviations become less frequent, and
greater uniformity is secured, and this is in proportion to the time
which elapses and the skill employed in selecting. Races are varieties
moulded to their peculiar type by _natural_ causes, with no interference
of man, and no intermixture of other varieties; that have continued
substantially the same, for a period beyond which the memory and
knowledge of man does not reach. Such are the North Devon Cattle."

There seems to have been three distinct races of these ancient cattle:
the Long Horns, the Middle Horns, and Hornless, or Polled Cattle. The
Middle Horns represented the cattle of the region of Devonshire. These
races of cattle were bred by the Ancient Celtic inhabitants, and
constituted their chief subsistence. Youatt says: "the native
inhabitants were proud of their country, and prouder of their cattle,
their choicest possession." When their country was invaded by their
enemies, they fled to the mountains for safety and protection, and took
with them their cattle upon which to subsist, and thus were preserved
both themselves and their cattle, so that the races of cattle in these
districts have been the same from time immemorial. In a few instances
the wild forest cattle have been kept distinct, in a wild state, to this
day; as in the parks of Chillingham and Chartley; and are said to be
similar to those that existed in the tenth century; and also bear a
strong resemblance to the present domestic breeds of that region. The
cattle in these parks are white, with red ears.


_Color._

Black or white were the principal colors, though where these were found
the memory of the red prevails. "It seems the people had a superstitious
reverence attached to it, (in Scotland and Wales), in the tradition of
the country; the milk of the red cow was considered a remedy for every
disease, and a preservative from every evil." The breeders of the
improved Devons adhere scrupulously to the deep red color of the hair,
and reject individuals that have a tendency to produce white. And it
seems that in this way, if no other, the color of the Devons has been
established and perpetuated. The deep red color of the pure bred Devon
is implanted so strongly, that there is no race in which an admixture of
foreign blood is so easily traced; nor is there a race that has remained
so free from foreign intermixture. Their color is generally stamped on
the progeny, in a cross with any other breed.


_English Improved Devons._

The improvement of these ancient races of cattle, which has resulted in
the present perfected breed, was commenced about one hundred and fifty
years ago. John Tanner Davy, of Rose Ash, England, the Editor of the
English Devon Herd Book, inherited the herd of his father, who had
carefully bred the Devons for fifty years. Mr. Francis Quartly, whose
engraving adorns the first volume of Davy's Devon Herd Book, endeavored
by a long course of selection, and by an intimate knowledge of the
principles of breeding, to combine the various elements in the different
herds, so as to attain the great object of the Devon breeder, the
lessening of the parts of the animal frame least useful to man, as the
bone and offal, and at the same time the increase of such other parts,
as fat and flesh, that furnish food, and to do this at the earliest
possible age, and with the least consumption of food. That Mr. Quartly
succeeded in fully establishing these characteristics of the breed, we
need no better evidence than that nine-tenths of the pedigrees of the
present herds in Davy's Herd Book, go directly back to the old Quartly
stock; twenty-seven out of twenty-nine of the prize bulls mentioned in
that work are descendants from the bull Forester, (46): and twenty-nine
out of thirty-four prize cows mentioned there, descended from the cow
Curly, (92). Hundred Guinea (56), another noted ancestor of the Quartly
tribe, stands in the pedigrees of this breed, as Hubback among the short
horns. Among others who have done much to improve their herds, and bring
the breed to its present state of perfection, may be mentioned, the Earl
of Leicester, James Davy, Mr. Richard Merson, James and John Quartly who
also inherited the herds of their fathers, and continued their well
begun improvement. Mr. George Turner, of Barton, whose herd was made up
from the other breeders, Mr. Samuel Farthing, of Somerset, Mr. John
Halse, of Moland, Mr. Wm. Hole, of Somerset, Mr. T. B. Morle, of
Cummington, Mr. George Shapland, of Oakford, and Mr. John Ayre Thomas,
of Rose Ash, Devon, with many others have caught the spirit of
improvement, and continued to progress towards perfection.


_Qualities._

Mr. Bloomfield, the manager of the late Earl of Leicester's estate, at
Holkam Hall, Norfolk, England, has, by careful attention, greatly
improved the size and quality of the Devons, and increased their milking
properties, so that he obtained a prize for having produced an average
annual yield of 200 pounds of butter per cow, in a dairy of twenty cows,
or equal to four pounds per week the year round; and he offered to milk
forty pure Devons from his own herd against an equal number of cows in
any one herd of any breed found in England, without finding a
competitor. At the Smithfield show of fat cattle, held at the London
market place, in 1858, the gold medal for the best ox or steer of any
breed in the show yard was awarded to a Devon, bred and owned by the
Earl of Leicester. They are highly esteemed in the Smithfield market,
not only for the excellence of the meat, but because its size is more
agreeable on most tables than the huge joints of some other breeds. In
weight they are much excelled, but the opinion of the Devon breeder is,
that more meat can be made from them, with a given amount of food, than
from any other breed. The quality of the Devon beef is unsurpassed, even
rivalling the little black West Highland ox, in the estimation of the
London west-end butcher, whose fastidious customers oblige him to kill
none but beef of the finest quality and flavor. In the New York market
the "red oxen of Connecticut" most generally bring the highest price,
they being Devon Grades. The Devons have the preference of all other
breeds for the yoke, being strong, active, and of great endurance; and
are remarkable for docility and good temper.

The cattle in many sections of New England resemble the Devons in many
respects, and the fact that most of the early settlers were from the
south of England, renders it quite probable that they selected their
cattle from that region. The first account that we have of the
importation of cattle into New England was in the ship Charity, in the
spring of 1623, in the care of Mr Winslow, then agent of the colony of
Plymouth. Their descendants show by their color that they were Devons,
or Devon grades.


_American Improved Devons._

The first importation of improved North Devons into this country was in
1817. Mr. Coke, then Earl of Leicester, presented to Mr. Robert
Patterson, of Baltimore, Md., six heifers and one bull, Taurus (320).
Taurus was bred by Mr. Denny, a tenant of Mr. Coke, then Earl of
Leicester, who paid fifty guineas for him. His dam, in 1820, made
thirteen pounds of butter per week. Three of these heifers Mr. Patterson
gave to his father-in-law, Mr. Richard Caton, the other three he gave to
his father, Mr. William Patterson; they were all bred to Taurus. In
1835, Mr. George Patterson came in possession of the herd of his father,
Mr. William Patterson, and, in 1836, imported the bull Anchises (140),
for a cross, from one of the best dairies in Devonshire; he afterward
imported Eclipse (191); in 1846, Herod (214), and in 1852, Norfolk
(266). By comparing the records the fact is apparent, that the pedigree
of animals dates further back in this country than in England. Thus the
bull Taurus (320), was calved in 1816, and imported in 1817, when a
yearling, by Mr. Robert Patterson, of Md.; Holkham (215), calved 1819;
the cow Fancy (709), calved 1818, and Strawberry 1st (1062), calved
1819. While the oldest record of English pedigrees is the bull Forester
(46), calved in 1827, and Hundred Guineas (56), calved in 1837; the cows
Flower (187), calved in 1820, Countess (77), in 1828, Curly (92), and
Pretty Maid (364), were calved in 1830. Messrs. S. & L. Hurlbut, of
Winchester, Conn., commenced their herd in 1819, from a pair procured of
Mr. Patterson, Holkham (115), and Fancy (709), with additions from the
same source every few years. In 1850 they imported Albert (2), whose
progeny has stood high in the country, and received more premiums than
the progeny of any other bull lately imported. Beauty (523), bred by Mr.
Hurlbut, in 1836, from Fancy (709), and Exchange (197), produced sixteen
pounds of butter per week, in June, 1850. Mr. Coleman, says, in his
European Agriculture, "the most productive cow in butter, which I have
found, was a North Devon, which, for several weeks in succession,
without extra feed, produced twenty-one pounds of butter per week. The
character of the owner places the fact beyond a doubt."

Mr. L. F. Allen, of Black Rock, N. Y., commenced breeding in 1835, from
stock obtained from the Hon. James L. King, of New York, whose father
imported them about the year 1819, from the herd of the Earl of
Leicester; in 1842 he added to his herd from Mr. Patterson's stock. In
1844 the Massachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture imported
four cows and one bull, Bloomfield (372), from the Earl of Leicester.
They were boarded and bred for the Society on the farm of Elias Phiney,
of Lexington, till his death, the object being to present a pair to each
of the County Societies in the State. In 1848, Mr. C. S. Wainwright, of
Rhinebeck, N. Y., commenced importing and breeding his herd; his first
importation was the bull Megunticook (251), and the cows Nonpareil
(924), and Helena (774); Helena gave as high as twenty-two quarts of
milk per day, and made fifteen pounds of butter per week. In 1851 he
imported May Boy (71), whose granddam, Old May Flower, made over
seventeen pounds of butter per week. In 1853, Mr. George Vail, of Troy,
N. Y., imported one bull and two heifers from the herds of Mr. Davy and
the Earl of Leicester. In 1850 and '52, Col. L. G. Morris, of New York,
imported animals from the herds of the Earl of Leicester, the Messrs.
Quartly and John Ayer Thomas. Abijah Catlin, of Conn., imported in 1851,
Rubens (116), and two heifers. Many others have imported animals equally
meritorious, among whom may be mentioned, Ambrose Stevens, of Batavia,
N. Y., E. G. Faile, West Farms, N. Y., R. Linsley, West Meriden, Conn.,
R. W. Sanford, Orwell, Vt., E. P. Beck, Sheldon, N. Y., and R. H. Van
Rensselaer, of Morris, N. Y. Importations have occurred almost annually
up to the present year. These importations, with many others not
mentioned, are sufficient to form the basis of a superior race of Devons
in America, not excelled by those in any other country.


_Devon Herd Book._

The _First Herd Book_ of the Devons was published in 1851, by John
Tanner Davy, of Rose Ash, near Southmolton, Devon, England. The
pedigrees of 132 bulls and 483 cows, in all 615 animals, were recorded;
all bred in England, and contributed by thirty-seven different breeders.

The _second volume_, published in 1854, contained the pedigrees of 221
bulls and 657 cows, 837 animals in all; and was edited by Mr. Davy, in
England, and Sanford Howard, in America, comprising animals bred and
owned in both countries, sixty breeders contributing in England, and
eighteen in America.

The _third volume_ was published in 1859, on both sides of the Atlantic,
by Messrs. Davy and Howard, independent of each other, Mr. Davy's third
volume recorded 204 bulls and 609 cows, in all 810 pedigrees, from
forty-one different herds in England, and eight in America. Mr. Howard's
recorded 258 bulls and 399 cows, in all 657 pedigrees, from eighty-four
different herds, and all from America.

The whole number recorded to the end of Howard's third volume is 2150
animals, comprising 611 bulls, and 1539 cows.


_American Devon Herd Book._

The present work, the first volume of the American Devon Herd Book,
published in March, 1863, under the direction of the Association of
Breeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock, was commenced about two years
since. It has progressed amid many discouraging circumstances, to say
nothing of the jealousy occasioned by the locality of its origin; and
has gradually won upon public confidence till the present time. It has
been the design of the Committee on Devon pedigrees to perfect a Devon
Herd Book that would meet the wants of all American Breeders of Devon
cattle. To accomplish this they have been untiring in their labors,
sparing no pains to thoroughly investigate each pedigree; and have
decided upon each, according to the facts received from the testimony
given. While some have been rejected, others have been deferred till
more light can be given to prove their purity of blood, which may be
done in season for the second volume. How far the Committee have
accomplished their designs the present volume will show for itself. It
is a relief, however, to the Committee to know, that the errors which
may occur, can be corrected in future volumes, or the present volume can
be perfected and republished. It was also designed to make _this_ the
first of a series of volumes, to be published once in four years, or as
often as the wants of the Devon breeders demand; and that would be
worthy of the title of the American Devon Herd Book, and receive the
universal patronage of all the Breeders of Devon Stock in America.

Considering the state of the country, and that the attention and time of
the great mass of the people are engaged in the all-absorbing and
dreadful reality, civil war, and that many of our breeders and importers
of Devon stock are personally engaged in their country's service, and
that all the Southern States of our Union have withdrawn themselves from
all connection with the Northern; considering all this, the breeders of
Thorough-Bred Devon Stock have contributed for the work far beyond our
most sanguine hopes. _Fifteen states_ are represented in this work by
_fifty-three_ different breeders, with the pedigrees of 151 bulls and
350 cows, making in all 501 animals which are recorded in this volume,
and all owned in America.

  ART. 14.--_Quarters_, long, and well filled between the hip bones
  and the rumps, showing a well turned finish; with a good muscular
  development extending to the hocks.                                  6

  ART. 15.--_Flanks_, moderately deep, full and mellow according to

  ART. 16.--_Legs_, of moderate length standing square under the
  body, with sufficient angle at the gambrel joint to secure
  strength and activity, the toes pointing straight to the forward
  feet; the bone fine and flat below the hock, sinews large and
  clear; the forearm well developed; the bone below the knee quite

  nearly horizontal with the back bone. Medium size being
  preferable for stock breeding in the Devon.                          3

  ART. 19.--_Color_, always red, but admits of different shades,
  the medium red are considered as combining the largest amount of
  valuable qualities. The very dark red being less thrifty, and
  generally hard handlers; while the very light red, with a thin
  papery skin are less hardy in a cold climate.                        1

  curly.                                                               2

  ART. 21.--_Carriage_, this is an important quality in the Devon,
  as he is destined for the yoke, as well as for the butcher. He

  that he is fitted for his proper place.                              4

  ART. 22.--_Quality_, on the thriftiness, the feeding properties,
  the value of the animal depends: and upon the _touch_ or handling
  qualities, rests in a great measure the graziers and butchers'
  judgment. If the handling be good, some deficiency in minor
  qualities may be excused; but if it be hard and stiff, nothing
  can compensate for so unpromising a feature. In raising the skin
  from the body between the thumb and finger, it should present a
  soft, flexible and substantial feel, and pressed by the out
  spread hand it should move easily with and under it, as if
  resting on a soft, elastic, cellular substance, which becomes
  firmer as the animal ripens.                                        15

  ART. 8.--_Brisket_, full and round, spreading the fore legs well
  at the junction with the body; not projecting, but forming a
  regular slant, without dewlap, to the throat.                        4

  ART. 9.--_Shoulder_, in this breed is a beautiful and important
  point, and should in a degree approximate to that of the horse;
  with points less prominent and in a more sloping position than in
  most other breeds, indicative of activity and good traveling
  quality.                                                             5

  ART. 10.--_Crops_, full and even, forming a line with the
  shoulder and back, extending well down the shoulder blade so as
  to prevent a cavity between the shoulder and the barrel.             5

  ART. 11.--_Back_, full, loin broad, with the short bones
  extending full to the hoop ribs; hip bones wide and on a level
  with the sacrum, and setting on of the tail.                         8

  ART. 12.--_Rumps_, broad, full, and well covered.                    3

  ART. 13.--_Escutcheon_, this should be broad, maintaining an even
  breadth from the udder to the sacrum.                                8

  ART. 14.--_Quarters_, long, and well filled between the hip bones
  and the rumps, with a good muscular development at a regular
  slant to the hocks.                                                  6

  A pork ham objectionable.

  ART. 15.--_Flanks_, moderately deep, full and mellow in
  proportion to condition.                                             4

  ART. 16.--_Legs_, fore legs of medium length, spread wide at the
  brisket, straight, with well developed, round, muscular arm,
  firmly knit at the knee, fine shank bone with large sinews,
  drawing nearer together as they approach the feet; hind legs with
  a gradual taper from the patella to the gambrel joint, which
  should be wide, leg below, fine and flat, with large sinews,
  forming an angle of thirty-three degrees, and moving in a
  straight line with the fore legs.                                    5

  Crooked knees or gambrels, causing an outward projection of the
  feet, deduct 3.

  ART. 17.--_Tail_, set on full and round, at a level with the
  back, small in the cord, and finishing with a tassel of white
  hair.                                                                2

  ART. 18.--_Carcass_ or _Barrel_, round and straight, its
  posterior ribs springing nearly horizontal from the vertebra,
  with less curve as they approach the posterior plates, with full
  and well developed anterior plates covering deep the springing
  rib.                                                                 4

  ART. 19.--_Color_, always red, but of different shades. A medium
  red should be preferred; the very dark red coming slower to
  maturity, their beef of poorer quality, of less weight, and
  inferior milking qualities; the light red less hardy, but claim
  earlier maturity and superior beef qualities. Some white about
  the udder is common to all the various shades, but confined to
  that part alone. In all cases the color grows lighter about the
  muzzle, while a color, verging almost to a black and growing yet
  darker about the head, always was a very objectionable color for
  the true North Devon, and when accompanied with a dark nose
  should be rejected.                                                  2

  ART. 20.--_--Hair_, should be short, thick, and fine; even
  throughout the body, and short about the head; a long, coarse
  foretop, accompanied by harsh, wiry hair elsewhere,
  objectionable.                                                       2

  ART. 21.--_Udder_, should be wide and well spread, projecting
  well forward and back, wide between the teats but not hanging;
  with milk veins large and extending well forward. 9

  ART. 22.--_Carriage_, the Devons having, from their excellence in
  the yoke, another destiny besides that of the butcher's block, it
  is important that the animal's carriage should indicate as much;
  to obtain this, something of the heavy, inert, squarely moulded
  frame of the merely beefing animal must be relinquished for a
  lighter and more active frame.                                       3

  ART. 23.--_Quality_, to combine this with the other highly
  important and characteristic properties of the Devon, requires no
  small skill, observation, and care in the breeder. For without
  this, in the eye of the experienced grazier and butcher, the
  animal is considered nearly worthless. No beauty of form can
  compensate for a hard, stiff feature, unyielding to the touch.
  The skin should have, when pressed between the thumb and finger,
  a mellow, yet substantial feel, and when beneath the outspread
  hand it should move easily with it, back and forth, as though
  resting on a soft, elastic, cellular substance, which becomes
  firmer as the animal ripens, forming a beautiful marbled beef,
  which is highly esteemed in the London market.                      10
  A thin papery skin is objectionable in a cold climate.             ---
  Perfection.                                                        100

The foregoing Scale of Points of Devon Cattle which the Association has
adopted, is mainly that published by the New York State Agricultural
Society, with such alterations and additions as the Committee deemed
proper. The numbers affixed to the points described form the _maximum_
that is allowed for each; and in proportion as the animal under
examination is deficient in any point, so must the number be decreased,
even should nothing be allowed for that point. Points which are
characteristic, and therefore _common to the breed_, though very
valuable in themselves, are marked comparatively low, because they are
easily obtained, and demand but little attention on the part of the
breeder; nevertheless an animal _not_ possessing the characteristics of
_the breed_, must of necessity be almost worthless. On the other hand,
points of less value, which are characteristic _deficiencies_ in the
breed, or at any rate difficult to sustain at their maximum excellence,
are marked numerically high, as they go _far_ to complete the natural
excellence of the animal.

examination of _Devon Cattle_, according to the _Scale of Points_
adopted by the _Cattle Breeders' Association_.

_No premium_ should be awarded to an animal having less than
seventy-five Numbers or approved Points.

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired. Text uses both Nonpariel and
Nonpareil.

The individual listing of cattle is in only slightly alphabetical order.
For example, Dawn comes after Dora Haines and before Dairy Maid and
Diana. This was retained. Some of the names were probably misprints such
as the occurrence of both Phatasie and Phantassie, but, as each only
occurred once and you may name a cow whatever you like, these were
retained.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
