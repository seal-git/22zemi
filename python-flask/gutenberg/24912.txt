[Illustration: "WHAT THE CHILD IMITATES, HE BEGINS TO
UNDERSTAND."--_Froebel._]




PREFACE.


"What the child imitates," says Froebel, "he begins to understand. Let
him represent the flying of birds and he enters partially into the
life of birds. Let him imitate the rapid motion of fishes in the water
and his sympathy with fishes is quickened. Let him reproduce the
activities of farmer, miller and baker, and his eyes open to the
meaning of their work. In one word let him reflect in his play the
varied aspects of life and his thought will begin to grapple with
their significance."

In all times and among all nations, finger-plays have been a delight
of childhood. Countless babies have laughed and crowed over
"Pat-a-cake" and other performances of the soft little hands; while
children of whatever age never fail to find amusement in playing

     "Here is the church,
       And here's the steeple,
     Open the doors,
       And here are the people!"

and others as well known.

Yet it is not solely upon the pleasure derived from them, that
finger-plays depend for their _raison d'etre_. By their judicious and
early use, the development of strength and flexibility in the tiny lax
fingers may be assisted, and dormant thought may receive its first
awakening call through the motions which interpret as well as
illustrate the phase of life or activity presented by the words.

The eighteen finger-plays contained in this book have already, through
publication in BABYLAND, been introduced to their especial public, and
have been much used in homes, though perhaps more in kindergartens. It
will readily be seen that while some of the plays are for the babies
in the nursery, others are more suitable for older children.

A baby-friend, ten months old, plays "All for Baby" throughout,
pounding and clapping gleefully with all his might--while children
seven or eight years of age play and sing "The Caterpillar," "How the
Corn Grew" and others with very evident enjoyment.

With a little study of the charming and expressive pictures with which
the artist, Mr. L.J. Bridgman, has so sympathetically illustrated the
rhymes, mothers and kindergartners have easily understood what motions
were intended. To elucidate still farther, however, the playing of
"The Merry Little Men" may be thus described:

During the singing of the first verse, the children look about in
every direction for the "little men," but keep the hands hidden. At
the beginning of the second verse, raise both hands to full view with
fingers outspread and quiet. At the words, "The first to come," etc.,
let the thumbs be shown alone, then the others as named in turn, till
all are again outspread as at the beginning of the second verse. In
the last verse the arms are moved from side to side, hands being
raised and fingers fluttering nimbly all the time. When displaying the
"busy little men," raise the hands as high as possible.

The music, composed by Miss Cornelia C. Roeske, will be found
melodious and attractive and especially suited to the voices and
abilities of the very young children for whom it is chiefly intended.

The harmonic arrangement is also purposely simple in consideration of
the many mothers and kindergartners who cannot devote time to
preparatory practice.

II.--THE LAMBS.


This is the meadow where all the long day
Ten little frolicsome lambs are at play.

[Illustration: THE MEADOW [hands clasped so arms form a circle]]

These are the measures the good farmer brings
Salt in, or cornmeal, and other good things.

[Illustration: THE MEASURES [hands cupped]]

This is the lambkins' own big water-trough;
Drink, little lambkins, and then scamper off!

[Illustration: THE TROUGH [hands held together and cupped]]

This is the rack where in winter they feed;
Hay makes a very good dinner indeed.

[Illustration: THE RACK [hands back to back with fingers interlaced
and raised]]

These are the big shears to shear the old sheep;
Dear little lambkins their soft wool may keep.

[Illustration: THE SHEARS [index and middle fingers extended
sideways]]

Here, with its big double doors shut so tight,
This is the barn where they all sleep at night.

Good Mother Hen sits here on her nest,
Keeps the eggs warm beneath her soft breast,
  Waiting, waiting, day after day.

[Illustration: ON THE NEST. [right hand horizontal with fingers
slightly curved; left hand in fist on top of right hand, with index
finger raised and curved]]

Hark! there's a sound she knows very well:
Some little chickens are breaking the shell,
  Pecking, pecking, pecking away.

[Illustration: BREAKING THE SHELL [fingers curved, thumb touching

Now they're all out, Oh, see what a crowd!
Good Mother Hen is happy and proud,
  Cluck-cluck, cluck-cluck, clucking away.

[Illustration: HAPPY AND PROUD [fist with index finger raised and

Into the coop the mother must go;
But all the chickens run to and fro,
  Peep-peep, peep-peep, peeping away.

Here is some corn in my little dish;
Eat, Mother Hen, eat all that you wish,
  Picking, picking, picking away.

Happy we'll be to see you again,
Dear little chicks and good Mother Hen!
  Now good-by, good-by for to-day.

In my little garden bed
  Raked so nicely over,
First the tiny seeds I sow,
  Then with soft earth cover.

  Help the seeds to soften.

Then the little plant awakes!
  Down the roots go creeping.
Up it lifts its little head
  Through the brown mould peeping.

[Illustration: "DOWN THE ROOTS GO" [fingers downward with middle 3

[Illustration: "LIFTS ITS LITTLE HEAD" [thumb extended upward]]

High and higher still it grows
  Through the summer hours,
Till some happy day the buds

Piggie Wig and Piggie Wee,
Hungry pigs as pigs could be,
For their dinner had to wait
Down behind the barnyard gate.

VI.--A LITTLE BOY'S WALK.


A little boy went walking
  One lovely summer's day:
He saw a little rabbit
  That quickly ran away;

[Illustration: THE RABBIT [index and middle finger in "V" sign]]

[Illustration: RAN AWAY [same, with arm moving behind back]]

He saw a shining river
  Go winding in and out,
And little fishes in it
  Were swimming all about;

[Illustration: SHINING RIVER [hands describing a long curve]]

[Illustration: THE FISHES [fingers waggling downward]]

And, slowly, slowly turning,
  The great wheel of the mill;
And then the tall church steeple,
  The little church so still;

[Illustration: MILL WHEEL [hands turning over each other]]

[Illustration: CHURCH STEEPLE [hands clasped upward, index fingers
steepled]]

The bridge above the water;
  And when he stopped to rest,
He saw among the bushes
  A wee ground-sparrow's nest.

[Illustration: THE BRIDGE [palms downward, fingers straight and
interlaced, thumbs extended downward]]

[Illustration: THE NEST [hands cupped sideways to form circle]]

And as he watched the birdies
  Above the tree-tops fly,
He saw the clouds a-sailing
  Across the sunny sky.

[Illustration: ABOVE THE TREE-TOP FLY [arms and hands extended
upward]]

[Illustration: CLOUDS A-SAILING [one arm extended upward, fingers

He saw the insects playing;
  The flowers that summer brings;
He said, "I'll go tell mamma!
  I've seen _so many_ things!"

Fuzzy little caterpillar,
Crawling, crawling on the ground!

Nowhere, nowhere to be found,
Though we've looked and looked and hunted
Everywhere around!

Found his furry coat too tight,

Spun of silk so soft and light;
Rolled himself away within it--
Slept there day and night.

For the squirrel has enough

XIV.--HOW THE CORN GREW.


There was a field that waiting lay,
  All hard and brown and bare;
There was a thrifty farmer came
  And fenced it in with care.

[Illustration: THE FIELD. [two children facing each other with their
arms extended onto each other's shoulders]]

Then came a plowman with his plow;
  From early until late,
Across the field and back again,
  He plowed the furrows straight.

[Illustration: THE PLOW. [hands together sideways, thumbs extended
slightly upward]]

The harrow then was brought to make
  The ground more soft and loose;
And soon the farmer said with joy,
  "My field is fit for use."

[Illustration: THE HARROW. [palms downward, fingers curved and
separated]]

For many days the farmer then
  Was working with his hoe;
And little Johnny brought the corn
  And dropped the kernels--so!

[Illustration: THE HOE. [palm downward, fingers together and bent at
knuckles]]

[Illustration: DROPPED THE KERNELS--SO! [palm downward, fingers

And there they lay, until awaked
  By tapping rains that fell,
Then pushed their green plumes up to greet
  The sun they loved so well.

[Illustration: TAPPING RAINS.

(Drumming with the fingers)]

[Illustration: POKED THEIR GREEN PLUMES UP. [fingers together

Then flocks and flocks of hungry crows
  Came down the corn to taste;
But ba-ang!--went the farmer's gun
  And off they flew in haste.

[Illustration: THE GUN.

(Snap the fingers) [one arm extended, holding elbow with other hand]]

Then grew and grew the corn, until,
  When autumn days had come,
With sickles keen they cut it down,
  And sang the "Harvest Home."

A merry little river
  Went singing day by day,
Until it reached a mill-dam
  That stretched across its way.

[Illustration: THE MILLDAM. [hand sideways, fingers straight]]

And there it spread its waters,
  A quiet pond, to wait
Until the busy miller
  Should lift the water-gate.

[Illustration: LIFT THE WATER-GATE. [hands sideways, bent at knuckles,
fingers straight]]

Then, hurrying through the gateway,
  The dashing waters found
A mighty millwheel waiting,
  And turned it swiftly round.

[Illustration: THE MILLWHEEL. [hands turning over one another]]

But faster turned the millstones
  Up in the dusty mill,
And quickly did the miller
  With corn the hopper fill.

[Illustration: THE MILLSTONES. [palms downward, fingers straight, one
hand moving in a circle on top of the other]]

And faster yet and faster
  The heavy stones went round,
Until the golden kernels
  To golden meal were ground.

"Now fill the empty hopper
  With _wheat_," the miller said;
"We'll grind this into flour
  To make the children's bread."

[Illustration: THE HOPPER. [hands cupped together]]

And still, as flowed the water,
  The mighty wheel went round;
And still, as turned the millstones,
  The corn and grain were ground.

And busy was the miller
  The livelong day, until
The water-gate he fastened,
  And silent grew the mill.

"The farmer and the miller
Have worked," the mother said,
"And got the flour ready,
So I will make the bread."
She scooped from out the barrel
The flour white as snow,
And in her sieve she put it
And shook it to and fro.

[Illustration: THE SCOOP. [hands cupped together]]

[Illustration: THE SIEVE. [fingers interlaced, palms upward, thumbs

Then in the pan of flour
A little salt she threw;
A cup of yeast she added,
And poured in water, too.
To mix them all together
She stirred with busy might,
Then covered it and left it
Until the bread was light.

More flour then she sifted
And kneaded well the dough,
And in the waiting oven
The loaves of bread did go.
The mother watched the baking,
And turned the loaves, each one,
Until at last, rejoicing,
She said, "My bread is done!"

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
