Descriptions of Two New Species of Frogs,
Genus Ptychohyla
Studies of American Hylid Frogs, V

BY

WILLIAM E. DUELLMAN


Field studies on hylid frogs in southern México and northern Central
America have resulted in the collection of numerous specimens of
_Ptychohyla_, a genus of hylid frogs heretofore poorly represented in
museum collections. Experience with the living frogs in their natural
habitats has been helpful in defining the species and in formulating
ideas concerning their relationships.

Taylor (1944) proposed the generic name _Ptychohyla_ for a new species
of frog, _Ptychohyla adipoventris_ [= _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_
(Ahl)--_fide_ Duellman, 1960] from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero. Taylor
defined the genus as having large ventrolateral glands and horny
nuptial spines in males. Stuart (1954:169) discussed the generic
characters and pointed out that both the ventrolateral glands and horny
nuptial spines were seasonal in their development, being found only in
breeding males. Stuart then went on to describe _Ptychohyla
schmidtorum_, a species characterized by the absence of horny nuptial
spines in breeding males. My investigations of these frogs have
revealed the presence of two groups of species. In both groups breeding
males have large ventrolateral glands, but the two groups are easily
separated by four characters. The first group contains, among others,
_Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_, _euthysanota_, _spinipollex_, and
another species in the Mesa Central of Chiapas to which I tentatively
apply the name _Ptychohyla macrotympanum_ (Tanner), 1957. This group of
species is characterized by horny nuptial spines in breeding males,
presence of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a single long note, and
tadpoles having lips not greatly expanded. The second group, as
recognized here, is characterized by the absence of horny nuptial
spines in breeding males, lack of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a
series of short notes, and tadpoles having greatly expanded lips. In
this group belong _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the two species
described below.

Only the descriptions of the new species are given in this paper;
detailed comparisons, descriptions of osteological features, analyses
of calls, and discussions of relationships are reserved for a
forthcoming review of the entire genus.

In the spring of 1959, collections of amphibians and reptiles were made
in the cloud forests on the northern slopes of the Sierra Madre
Oriental in northern Oaxaca. Among the hylids found, two specimens of a
heretofore unnamed species of _Ptychohyla_ have brilliant red
flash-colors on the groin and thighs; in allusion to these fiery colors
I propose that this species be named:

~_Ptychohyla ignicolor_~ new species

(Plate 25, Fig. 1)

     _Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No.
     119603, from a stream 6 kilometers south of Vista Hermosa,
     Oaxaca, México (1865 meters); obtained on March 31, 1959, by
     Thomas E. Moore. Original Number WED 14159.

     _Paratype._--UMMZ 119602 from Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca (1500
     meters); obtained on March 30, 1959, by William E. Duellman.

     _Diagnosis._--A species of the _schmidtorum_-group of
     _Ptychohyla_ differing from other known members of the group
     in having the diameter of the tympanum less than one-half
     the diameter of the eye, no white spot below the eye, no
     lateral light stripe, bright green dorsum in life and red
     flash-colors on groin and thighs.

     _Description of Holotype._--Adult male having a snout-vent
     length of 30.0 mm.; tibia length, 14.6 mm.; tibia
     length/snout-vent length, 48.7 per cent; foot length
     (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to
     tip of longest toe), 12.3 mm.; head length, 9.2 mm.; head
     length/snout-vent length, 32.3 per cent; head width, 9.3
     mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 31.0 per cent; diameter
     of eye, 3.2 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.3 mm.;

     square, in dorsal profile obtusely rounded; canthus
     pronounced; loreal region slightly concave; lips moderately
     flaring; top of head flat; nostrils protuberant; internarial
     distance, 2.8 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.3 mm., much
     broader than width of eyelid, 2.8 mm. A heavy dermal fold
     from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to insertion of
     forelimb, covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum
     elliptical, its greatest diameter equal to its distance from
     eye. Forearm robust with a distinct fold on wrist; pollex
     moderately enlarged without nuptial spines; second and
     fourth fingers equal in length; subarticular tubercles
     round; none is bifid; disc of third finger slightly larger
     than tympanum; no web between first and second fingers;
     vestige of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when
     hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to
     anterior corner of eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal
     tubercle large, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal
     tubercle near inner one and triangular; subarticular
     tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest
     1-2-5-3-4; toes about one-half webbed; discs smaller on toes
     than on fingers. Anal opening directed posteriorly at upper
     level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of large tubercles below
     anal opening; small tubercles ventral and lateral to these.
     Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs smooth, that of
     throat and belly granular. Ventrolateral glands noticeably
     thickened, extending from axilla nearly to groin and only
     narrowly separated medially on chest. Skin of anterior part
     of chin thickened and glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly
     notched behind and only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine
     teeth 0-3, situated on rounded elevations between somewhat
     larger, round inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one
     situated along posterior margin of each mandibular ramus.

[Illustration: FIG. 1. Paratype of _Ptychohyla ignicolor_
(UMMZ 119602). × 3.]

[Illustration: FIG. 2. Holotype of _Ptychohyla chamulae_
(KU 58063). × 3.]

     Color (in alcohol) dull brown above with irregular dark
     brown blotches; dorsal surfaces of limbs brown with narrow
     darker brown transverse bars; posterior surfaces of thighs
     cream-color with brown spots and mottling; groin and dorsal
     surfaces of first and second toes white; belly
     cream-colored; glandular areas orange-brown; chest and chin
     having black spots. Ventral surfaces of hind limbs and first
     toes cream-colored; undersides of other toes and soles of
     feet brown.

     Color (in life) uniform bright green above; venter pale
     creamy yellow; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs,
     ventral surfaces of shanks, anterior surfaces of tarsi and
     upper proximal surfaces of first three toes red; iris pale
     golden color.

     The paratype is an adult male, having a snout-vent length of
     26.3 mm., and agrees with the holotype in proportions. The
     ventrolateral glands are less extensive and the chin less
     spotted than in the holotype.

     _Comparisons_: Both _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the species
     described below differ from _P. ignicolor_ in lacking red
     flash-colors and in having a white spot below the eye.
     _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ also differs in having a small
     tympanum. As stated above, these species can be
     distinguished from the rest of the genus by the absence of a
     tarsal fold and absence of horny nuptial spines in breeding
     males.

     _Remarks_: The holotype was found on a moss-covered log over
     a stream in dense cloud forest by day. The paratype was
     calling at night from a low herb at the edge of a small
     stream in the cloud forest. Nearby a _Ptychohyla
     leonhard-schultzei_ was calling.

Along two cascading mountain streams in cloud forest on the northern
slopes of the Mesa Central in central Chiapas numerous specimens of a
distinctive species of _Ptychohyla_ were found in association with two
species of _Hyla_ and two of _Plectrohyla_. The first specimen of this
new species of _Ptychohyla_ was discovered by Dale L. Hoyt, who found
the frog on a rock at midday. At night on August 5, 1960, numerous
individuals were found calling from leaves of plants growing on the
slopes of the ravine by the streams. None was more than two meters
above the ground. Tadpoles were found in the fast-flowing stream, where
they were holding onto rocks with their mouths. Little is known of the
herpetofauna of these mountains that are the home of the Chamula
Indians. Since the little frog described here comes from the land of
the Chamulas, I propose that it be named:

~_Ptychohyla chamulae_~ new species

(Plate 25, Fig. 2)

     _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History
     No. 58063, from a stream above (6.2 kilometers by road

     interorbital distance, 3.3 mm.; much broader than width of
     eyelid, 2.4 mm. A thin dermal fold from posterior corner of
     eye above tympanum to insertion of forelimb, covering upper
     edge of tympanum; tympanum nearly round, its diameter equal
     to its distance from eye. Forearm slender lacking distinct
     fold on wrist; a row of low, rounded tubercles on
     ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex moderately enlarged
     without nuptial spines; second and fourth fingers equal in
     length; subarticular tubercles round, none bifid; discs
     small, that of third finger noticeably smaller than
     tympanum; no web between first and second fingers; vestige
     of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when hind limbs
     adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of
     eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal tubercle large, flat,
     and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle slightly more
     distal than inner, small, and elliptical; subarticular
     tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest
     1-2-5-3-4; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc;
     fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs
     smaller on toes than on fingers. Anal opening directed
     posteriorly at upper level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of
     large tubercles below anal opening and a slightly smaller
     pair farther below. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of
     forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and
     ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands
     well developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly
     separated midventrally. Skin of anterior part of chin
     glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly notched behind and
     only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated
     on small triangular elevations between large, ovoid inner
     nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner
     posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.

     Color (in alcohol) dark purplish brown on dorsal surfaces of
     head, body, and shanks; thighs brown above and yellowish tan
     posteriorly; white stripe extending from below eye above
     forearm to mid-flank. Ventral surfaces creamy white;
     ventrolateral glands orange-tan flecked with dark brown;
     edge of lower lip with dark brown spots; narrow white line
     on upper lip; palms white and soles brown.

     Color (in life) uniform dark bright green above with creamy
     white bar below eye; lateral stripe silvery white; ventral
     surfaces deep yellow; posterior surfaces of thighs yellow
     brown; iris reddish bronze.

     _Variation._--Sixteen adult males are available; these have
     snout-vent lengths of 26.3 to 28.5 mm. (average, 27.6 mm.).
     The tympanum/eye ratio is 48.2 to 58.6 per cent (average,
     53.2 per cent). The number of vomerine teeth varies from
     four to six. The extent of the ventrolateral glands is
     variable. In five specimens the glands nearly meet
     midventrally; in two others the glands include the axillary
     region; in none do the glands extend into the groin. In
     other structural details there is no noticeable variation.

     The greatest variation in color pattern is found in the
     lateral stripe. The pale spot or bar below the eye is
     present in all specimens; in one individual there is no
     lateral stripe; in three the stripe extends posteriorly only
     to above the forearm, in two to the mid-flank, and in the
     others to the groin.

     Although all of the males were bright uniform green above
     when collected at night as they were calling, some changed
     color later. In these individuals the dorsum became a
     somewhat paler green with faint irregular yellowish tan
     blotches.

     The one available female (UMMZ 121399) has a snout-vent
     length of 30.3 mm. and a tympanum/eye ratio of 52.8 per
     cent, and is colored like the males. The tubercles by the
     anal opening are placed irregularly and do not consist of
     two pairs below the opening. There are no ventrolateral
     glands, glandular area on the chin, or enlarged prepollex.

     _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla chamulae_ resembles _P.
     schmidtorum_ in color pattern and body proportions, but the
     ground color of _schmidtorum_ is chocolate brown and not
     green as in _chamulae_. Also, in _schmidtorum_ the webbing
     and posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale cream-color in
     preserved specimens as contrasted with tan in _chamulae_. In
     living _schmidtorum_ the iris is bright red, not reddish
     bronze as in _chamulae_. The ventrolateral glands in
     _schmidtorum_ more closely approximate one another
     midventrally than in _chamulae_. It is conceivable that
     these populations are subspecifically related; _schmidtorum_
     occurs in the same kind of habitat as does _chamulae_, but
     is known only from the Pacific slopes of southeastern
     Chiapas and southwestern Guatemala, whereas _chamulae_ is
     known only from the Atlantic slopes of the Mesa Central in
     north-central Chiapas. Both of these species differ from
     _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ in having a relatively larger
     tympanum, more webbing on the foot, different arrangement of
     anal tubercles, and different coloration.

     _Description of Tadpole._--Six tadpoles having fully
     developed mouth parts have body lengths of 5.5 to 11.9 mm.
     and total lengths of 17.3 to 44.0 mm. The following
     description is based on a tadpole (KU 58199) having small
     hind limbs, a body length of 10.5 mm., and a total length of
     39.0 mm. Body ovoid, only slightly flattened dorsally and
     ventrally (Fig. 1); body only slightly deeper than wide;
     eyes directed dorsolaterally and slightly protuberant;
     nostrils small. Tail long and slender; greatest depth of
     tail-musculature two-thirds greatest depth of tail-fin;
     tail-musculature extending nearly to tip of tail-fin.

     Mouth directed anteroventrally; thin fleshy lips greatly
     expanded and forming large suckerlike disc; width of mouth
     greater than width of snout and nearly as wide as body.
     Outer edge of lips having small papillae; inner surface of
     mouth smooth; scattered large papillae, seemingly in rows,
     around teeth and beak (Fig. 2). Tooth rows 3/3; the upper
     rows subequal in length; upper rows one and three
     interrupted medially; lower rows one and two about equal in
     length to upper rows; third lower row short. Upper beak
     heavy and horn-covered.

(KU 58199). × 2.5.]

[Illustration: FIG. 2. Mouthparts of tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_
(KU 58199). × 16.]

     Color (in alcohol) dark brown over entire body and
     tail-musculature; a white area near base of tail, and a dark
     streak on anterior one-fourth of tail; tail-fin transparent
     having brown blotches.

     _Remarks_.--Five metamorphosing tadpoles and juveniles (KU
     58074, 58234-8) were found at night on vegetation by
     streams. Of two completely metamorphosed young each has a
     snout-vent length of 15.7 mm. Another having a snout-vent
     length of 16.2 mm. has a tail stub 2 mm. long and a
     completely metamorphosed mouth. Two others have snout-vent
     lengths of 13.6 and 14.1 mm. and tail lengths of 11.5 and
     8.1 mm. respectively; in these the mouth parts are
     incompletely metamorphosed. The single female available
     (UMMZ 121399) contains approximately 60 ovarian eggs, the
     largest of which are about 2.5 mm. in diameter.

     _Referred Specimens.--Chiapas_: 6.2 km. S of Rayón
     Mescalapa, KU 58063-74, 58199 (1 tadpole), 58234-8; 5.6 km.
     S of Rayón Mescalapa, KU 58062, 58200 (5 tadpoles); 11.4 mi.
     N of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, UMMZ 121395-9. The
     specimens listed last were collected along a stream between
     Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán and Rayón Mescalapa, which,
     according to Floyd L. Downs, is probably the same stream
     listed above as 5.6 km. S of Rayón Mescalapa.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
