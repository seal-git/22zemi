@Afghanistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during more than 18 years of war, including the
nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
1989). During the war one-third of the population fled the country,
with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6
million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan refugees remain
in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1 million have
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Gross
domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 18 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport. Much of the population continues to suffer from
insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation
remains a serious problem throughout the country, with one estimate
putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996. Numerical data are likely
to be either unavailable or unreliable.

@Albania:Economy

Economy-overview: An extremely poor country by European standards,
Albania is making the difficult transition to a more open-market
economy. The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression
accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in
1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain
stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to
renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early
1997-which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of
Albania's adult population - triggered severe social unrest which led
to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an
8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in July 1997 has taken
strong measures to restore public order and to revive economic
activity and trade. The economy continues to be bolstered by
remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly
in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset
the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized
in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.

GDP: purchasing power parity-$4.5 billion (1997 est.)

@Algeria:Economy

Economy-overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of
GDP, and almost all export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country
into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a
comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization
and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite
substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform
drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In
September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the
resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.
Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year
signed onto a three-year extended fund facility. Progress on economic
reform, a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector
expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in
developing hydrocarbon resources are likely to maintain growth and
export earnings. Continuing but gradual government efforts to attract
foreign and domestic investment outside that sector seek to diversify
the economy and tackle problems of high unemployment and falling
living standards, problems as yet untouched by the macroeconomic
turnaround.

@American Samoa:Economy

Economy-overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the
great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the
primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoa's economic well-being. According to one observer,
attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are
restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and
its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, may be held
back in 1998 by the financial difficulties in East Asia.

@Andorra:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do
economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10 million
tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and
by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has
recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have
been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower
tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also
contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU
member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU
member for agricultural products.

ANGOLA

Introduction

Current issues: Civil war has been the norm since independence from
Portugal on 11 November 1975. A cease-fire between the government and
(UNITA) lasted from 31 May 1991 until October 1992 when UNITA refused
to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and
fighting resumed throughout much of the country. The two sides signed
another peace accord on 20 November 1994 and the cease-fire is
generally holding, but military tensions and banditry persist. The
peace accord provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents
into the Angolan armed forces and the government. A Government of
National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April 1997 and
military integration was declared complete in June 1997, although
UNITA filled fewer than half of the military positions allocated to
the rebels. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into

@Angola:Economy

Economy-overview: Angola is an economy in disarray because of more
than 20 years of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant
natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the
population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to
the economy, contributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the
signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence
continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are
reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
resources-gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,
arable land, and large oil deposits-Angola will need to implement the
peace agreement and reform government policies. Despite the high
inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an estimated
9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production and higher oil
prices.

@Anguilla:Economy

Economy-overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy
depends heavily on high-class tourism, offshore banking, lobster
fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects
of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996. Anguillan
officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore
financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial services
legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term, prospects
for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and, therefore, on
continuing income growth in the industrialized nations.

Land boundaries: 0 km
note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline: 17,968 km

Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International disputes

Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
the coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
ranges up to about 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts
of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,

Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary-The Antarctic Treaty, signed
on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes
the legal framework for the management of Antarctica. Administration
is carried out through consultative member meetings-the 18th Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. Currently,
there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.
Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and
19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made
no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize
the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an
acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while
no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.
Claimant nations are-Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,
Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are-Belgium,
Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany
(1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),
Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain
(1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. Acceding
(nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,
are-Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),
Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea
(1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and
Ukraine (1992). Article 1-area to be used for peaceful purposes only;
military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but
military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research
or any other peaceful purpose; Article 2-freedom of scientific
investigation and cooperation shall continue; Article 3-free exchange
of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN and other
international agencies; Article 4-does not recognize, dispute, or
establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while
the treaty is in force; Article 5-prohibits nuclear explosions or
disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6-includes under the treaty
all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south; Article
7-treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8-allows for
jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
Article 9-frequent consultative meetings take place among member
nations; Article 10-treaty states will discourage activities by any
country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; Article
11-disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or,
ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14-deal with upholding,
interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations; other
agreements-more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty
consultative meetings and ratified by governments include-Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a
mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently
rejected; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January
1998; this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic
environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna,
and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and
protected areas; it also prohibits all activities relating to mineral
resources except scientific research; 27 parties have ratified the
Protocol as of April 1998

Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: the
taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,
Arlington, Virginia 22230 (703) 306-1031.

@Antigua and Barbuda:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism continues to be by far the dominant activity
in the economy accounting directly or indirectly to more than half of
GDP. Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth in the
construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's
agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the
sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages
that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction.
Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major
products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to
depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the
US, which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.

cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack
that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges
may be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
Gyral Stream, but nearly straight line movement from the New Siberian
Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
land masses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin
interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen
Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge)

@Argentina:Economy

Economy-overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a
highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was
plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
that has put Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.
Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April
1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years.
Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating capital
and investing in domestic industry. Growth averaged more than 8%
between 1991 and 1994, then fell 4.6% in 1995, largely in reaction to
the Mexican peso crisis. The economy has since recovered strongly.
However, unemployment remains nearly 14%, and Buenos Aires still
depends on foreign capital to meet the bulk of its financing needs.
The IMF has urged additional economic reforms to ensure equitable
long-term growth.

Introduction

Current issues: Armenia's leaders remain preoccupied by Armenia's
10-year conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
Although a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the sides
have not made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. In
January 1998, differences between President TER-PETROSSIAN and members
of his cabinet over the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process came to a head.
With the prime minister and defense and security ministers arrayed
against him, an isolated TER-PETROSSIAN resigned the presidency on 3
February 1998. Robert KOCHARIAN, TER-PETROSSIAN's prime minister, was
elected president in March 1998. Concerns about Armenia's economic
performance rose in 1997 with a slowdown in growth and an increase in
inflation.

@Armenia:Economy

Economy-overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR
in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away
from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet area. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and
updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower
pace, but ahead of most of the rest of the CIS. Armenia is a food
importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the embargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and
Turkey contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By
1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth
rates in 1995-97. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to
privatize most small and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy
shortages Armenia suffered in recent years has been partially offset
by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor,
which in 1996 supplied about 40% of the country's energy needs,
according to the Armenian Government. Moreover, Armenia is expanding
its energy imports from Iran.

@Aruba:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has
further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than 1%
unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job vacancies
despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

@Australia:Economy

Economy-overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist
economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the highly
industrialized West European countries. Rich in natural resources,
Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,
metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value of
total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a
big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased
exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international
markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low
growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at reasonably steady rates
in recent years. In addition to high unemployment, short-term economic
problems include a balancing of output growth and inflationary
pressures and the stimulation of exports to offset rising imports,
especially given the economic crisis in Asia.

@Austria:Economy

Economy-overview: Austria, a member of the European Union since 1
January 1995, has a well-developed market economy with a high standard
of living. With exports of goods and services reaching over 40% of
GDP, Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member
countries, especially with Germany. Austria's entry into the EU has
drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to
the single European market. Austria is well on its way to meeting all
Maastricht convergence criteria for monetary union, through
privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget consolidation programs, and
austerity measures, which were expected to bring total public sector
deficit down to 3% of GDP in 1997 and public debt in line with the 60%
of GDP required by the EU. Cuts mainly affect the civil service and
Austria's generous social system, the two major causes of the
government deficit. To meet increased competition from both the EU and
Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize
knowledge-based sectors of the economy and deregulate the service
sector, particularly telecommunications and the energy sector.
Economic prospects are expected to brighten in 1998 with GDP growth
projected to be 2.5%.

Introduction

Current issues: Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
10-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
creating almost 1 million Azerbaijani refugees in the process. Both
sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
since May 1994.

@Azerbaijan:Economy

Economy-overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
either Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It
resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim
population, high structural unemployment, and low standard of living.
The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas.
Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for
several years, but the negotiation of more than a dozen
production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have
thus far committed $30 billion to oil field development, should
generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil
production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan
International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan
shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in
making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its
considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku
has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old
economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major
short-term obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign
investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic
Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Trade with Russia and
the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while
trade is building up with the nations of Europe, Turkey, Iran, and the
UAE. A serious long-term challenge is the maintenance of the
competitiveness of non-oil exports in world markets.

@Bahamas, The:Economy

Economy-overview: The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with an
economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
alone accounts for more than 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly
employs 40% of the archipelago's labor force. Moderate growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts,
and residences led to an increase of the country's GDP by an estimated
3.5% in 1997. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute less
than 10% of GDP and show little growth despite government incentives
aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run will
depend heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector and continued
income growth in the US, which accounts for the majority of tourist
visitors.

@Bahrain:Economy

Economy-overview: In Bahrain, petroleum production and processing
account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues,
and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing
fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf
crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and
transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms
with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of
petroleum products made from imported crude. Construction proceeds on
several major industrial projects. Unemployment, especially among the
young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources
are major long-term economic problems.

nations. Annual GDP growth has averaged over 4% in recent years from a
low base. Its economy is largely agricultural, with the cultivation of
rice the single most important activity in the economy. Major
impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
resources (natural gas), inadequate power supplies, and slow
implementation of economic reforms. Frequent strikes that crippled the
economy in 1995 and early 1996 subsided after Prime Minister Sheikh
HASINA Wajed's Awami League government assumed power in mid-1996,
allowing a return to normal economic activity. The current government
has made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and
liberalizing the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with
foreign firms for oil and gas exploration, better countrywide
distribution of cooking gas, and the construction of natural gas
pipelines and power plants. Progress on other economic reforms has
been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector
unions, and other vested interest groups.

@Barbados:Economy

Economy-overview: Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but
production in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and
tourism. The start of the Port Charles Marina project in Speightstown
helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996-97. The
government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high
unemployment rate, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize
remaining state-owned enterprises.

@Belarus:Economy

Economy-overview: The Belarusian government has revived economic
output since mid-1996 by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion,
ending years of cumulative decline. Real GDP increased by 2.6% in 1996
and the growth rate tripled in 1997. Lack of profitability and
resurgent inflation-which increased from an average monthly rate of
2.8% in 1996 to 4.4% in 1997-however, have kept enterprises from
making much needed capital investments. As a result, infrastructure
and equipment stocks have continued to deteriorate. Belarus has seen
little structural reform since 1995, when LUKASHENKO launched the
country on the path of "market socialism." Privatization of
enterprises controlled by the central government virtually ceased in
1996. As of May 1997, only about 10% of all enterprises under central
government control had been privatized. In addition, LUKASHENKO has
re-imposed administrative control over prices and the national
currency's exchange rate, and expanded the state's right to intervene
arbitrarily in the management of private enterprise. Lack of
structural reform, and a climate hostile to business, have inhibited
foreign investment in Belarus in 1995-97. In 1995 Belarus ranked
second to last among the 15 former Soviet republics in terms of the
average amount of foreign investment it attracted per capita. Although
it moved up to 11th place in 1996, this was largely due to inflows
from Russia related to the construction of the Yamal natural gas
pipeline. Belarus's trade deficit has grown steadily over the past
three years - from 8% of total trade turnover in 1995 to 14% in the
first quarter of 1997 - despite the government's efforts to promote
exports and limit imports. Given Belarus's limited fiscal reserve, a
continued growth in the trade deficit will increase vulnerability to a
balance of payments crisis.

@Belgium:Economy

Economy-overview: This highly developed private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed
transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north, although the government is encouraging reinvestment in the
southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources, Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large
volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the
state of world markets. Two-thirds of its trade is with other EU
countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% annual pace during the
period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993,
recovered with moderate 2.3% growth in 1994 and 1995, and fell off
again to 1.4% in 1996, with continued substantial unemployment.
Belgium's public debt fell from 127% of GDP in 1996 to 124% in 1997,
and the government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the
figure more into line with other industrialized countries. GDP growth
of 2.5% is forecast for 1998.

@Belize:Economy

Economy-overview: The small, essentially private enterprise economy is
based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for more than one-third of
exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest employer.
The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted in an
economic slowdown that is likely to continue in 1998. Political
tension in the run-up to the elections will tend to discourage
investment, already suffering as a result of tight monetary and fiscal
policies. The trade deficit has been growing, mostly as a result of
low export prices for sugar and bananas and could increase further if
a pre-election boost in government spending leads to a rise in
imports. The ruling in 1997 by the World Trade Organization against
the European Union's banana import regime-which had granted Belize
preferential treatment - is also hurting the prospects for growth, and
could contribute to an increase in already high unemployment.

@Benin:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output, which had averaged a sound 4% during
1990-95, rose to 5.5% in 1996 and was targeted at 4.8% for 1997. Rapid
population growth offset much of this growth in output. Inflation
jumped to 55% in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50%
currency devaluation in January 1994, but has subsided over the past
three years, with a target of 3.5% inflation in 1997. Commercial and
transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are extremely
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral creditors has eased
the external debt situation in recent years. The government, still
burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a bloated civil
service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank supported
structural adjustment program since 1991.

@Bermuda:Economy

Economy-overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world, having successfully exploited its location by providing
financial services for international firms and luxury tourist
facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist industry, which
accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84% of its business
from North America. The industrial sector is small, and agriculture is
severely limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80% of food needs
are imported. International business contributes over 60% of Bermuda's
economic output; a failed independence vote in late 1995 can be
partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms.

@Bhutan:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and least
developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the
main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about 40% of
GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal
husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building
of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy
is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary
links. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most
production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key
resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.
Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. GDP growth
averaged 5% per year in 1991-95, with information not yet available
for 1996-97. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas like
industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper
foreign investment.

@Bolivia:Economy

Economy-overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
3.25% during his tenure. President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) vowed
to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as
PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes included the signing
of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common
Market (Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,
phone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil company.
Furthermore, SANCHEZ DE LOZADA sponsored legislation creating private
social security accounts for all adult Bolivians and capitalized these
new accounts with the state's remaining 50% share in the privatized
companies. Hugo BANZER Suarez took office in August 1997 and has
proclaimed his commitment to the economic reforms of the previous
administration.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

Introduction

Current issues: On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former
Yugoslavia's three warring parties signed a peace agreement that
brought to a halt over three years of interethnic civil strife in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14
December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then by Bosnian President
IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the
Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining
Bosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in
Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement.
IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR)
whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR will remain in
place until June 1998. A High Representative appointed by the UN
Security Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the
accord, including monitoring implementation, facilitating any
difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation, and
coordinating activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian conflict began in the spring of
1992 when the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum
on independence and the Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring
Serbia-responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the
republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a
"greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced
the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an
agreement in Washington creating their joint Muslim/Croat Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation, formed by the Muslims and
Croats in March 1994, is one of two entities (the other being the
Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that comprise Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Government-note: Until declaring independence in spring 1992, Bosnia
and Herzegovina existed as a republic in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia
was partitioned by fighting during 1992-95 and governed by competing
ethnic factions. Bosnia's current governing structures were created by
the Dayton Accords, the 1995 peace agreement which was officially
signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC,
Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President MILOSEVIC. This
agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint
multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government-based
on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the
former socialist regime-is charged with conducting foreign, economic,
and fiscal policy. The Dayton Accords also recognized a second tier of
government, comprised of two entities-a joint Muslim/Croat Federation
and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS)-each presiding over roughly
one-half the territory. The Federation and RS governments are charged
with overseeing internal functions. As mandated by the Dayton Accords,
the Bosnians on 14 September 1996 participated in the first post-war
elections of national, entity, and cantonal leaders. The Bosnians have
been slow to form and install new joint institutions. A new Federation
cabinet was sworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central
government cabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997. The Bosnians on
13-14 September 1997 participated in municipal elections, postponed in
1996 because of voter registration irregularities.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Economy

Economy-overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been
greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of communist
central planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of
military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic
warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to
1995, unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an
uneasy peace in place, output has recovered in 1996-97 at high
percentage rates on a low base, but remains less than half the 1990
level. The country, especially in the Muslim-Croat area, receives
substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
community. Wide regional differences in war damage and access to the
outside world have resulted in substantial variations in living
conditions among local areas and individual families.

@Botswana:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture still provides a livelihood for more
than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs
and accounts for only 4% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle
raising predominate. Diamond mining and tourism also are important to
the economy. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils.
Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining
sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 35% in 1997. Unemployment
officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. On
the plus side is the substantial positive trade balance.

@Brazil:Economy

Economy-overview: Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its
presence in world markets. Prior to the institution of a stabilization
plan-the Plano Real (Real Plan) in mid-1994, stratospheric inflation
rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged foreign
investment. Since then, tight monetary policy has brought inflation
under control-consumer prices increased by less than 5% in 1997
compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP growth
slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997 due to tighter credit.
The strong currency, another cornerstone of the Real Plan, has
encouraged imports-contributing to a growing trade deficit-and
restrained export growth. Brazil's more stable economy allowed it to
weather the fallout in 1995 from the Mexican peso crisis relatively
well. Record levels of foreign investment have flowed in, helping
support the Real Plan through financial shocks in October-November
1997 that occurred in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. These
shocks caused Brazil's foreign exchange reserves to drop by $8 billion
to $52 billion and the stock market to decline by about 25%, although
it still ended up more than 30% for the year. President CARDOSO
remains committed to defending the Real Plan, but he faces several key
challenges domestically and abroad. His package of fiscal reforms
requiring constitutional amendments has progressed slowly through the
balkanized Brazilian legislature; in their absence, the government
continues to run deficits and has limited room to relax its interest
and exchange rate policies if it wants to keep inflation under
control. Some foreign investors remain concerned about the viability
of Brazil's exchange rate policy because of the country's fiscal and
current account deficits. The government thus has to contend with the
possibility of capital flight or a speculative attack that could draw
down foreign reserves to a critical level and force a devaluation.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the
Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an
estimated 45% of the national income. In 1985, the government began
offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in
the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues.
An estimated 210,000 companies were on the offshore registry by
yearend 1996. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late
1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated
statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, is expected
to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to
international business. Livestock raising is the most important
agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet
domestic food requirements. Because of traditional close links with
the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar
as their currency since 1959.

@Brunei:Economy

Economy-overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of foreign
and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare
measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally supported by
exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum
sector accounting for perhaps half of GDP. Per capita GDP is far above
most other Third World countries, and substantial income from overseas
investment supplements income from domestic production. The government
provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing. The
government is beginning to show progress on its basic policy of
diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy
will undermine internal social cohesion.

@Bulgaria:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the poorest countries of central Europe,
Bulgaria has slowly been moving from its old command economy towards a
market-oriented economy. The economy faced a major crisis in 1996,
marked by a banking system in turmoil, a depreciating currency, and
contracting production and foreign trade. Foreign exchange reserves
dwindled to $518 million, while dramatically hiked interest rates
added to the domestic debt burden and stifled growth. GDP fell by 11%
in 1996, after experiencing 2.0% growth in 1995. Privatization of
state-owned industries stagnated, although the first auction of a mass
privatization program was undertaken in late 1996. Lagging progress on
structural reforms led to postponement of IMF disbursements under a
$580 million standby loan agreed to in July 1996. In November 1996,
the IMF proposed a currency board as Bulgaria's best chance to restore
confidence in the lev, eliminate unnecessary spending, and avoid
hyperinflation. The board was set up on 1 July 1997. Its establishment
was followed by a reduction in inflation and interest rates and by a
rise in foreign investment. Simultaneously the government pledged to
sell off some of the most attractive state assets. GDP in 1997 dropped
7.4%, but is expected to rebound to an estimated 2% in 1998. Other
government objectives include: the completion of land reform, the
privatization and strengthening of the banking system, and the
modernization of the legal environment of business.

@Burma:Economy

Economy-overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the last nine
years, 1989-97, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three
decades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly
increased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with
moderate success; and efforts continue to increase the efficiency of
state enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are
greatly understated because of the volume of black-market trade. A
major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich
resources furnish the potential for substantial long-term increases in
income, exports, and living standards.

BURUNDI

Introduction

Current issues: in a number of waves since October 1993, hundreds of
thousands of refugees have fled the ethnic violence between the Hutu
and Tutsi factions in Burundi and crossed into Rwanda, Tanzania, and
Zaire (now called Democratic Republic of the Congo); since October
1996, an estimated 92,000 Hutu refuguees have been forced to return to
Burundi by Tutsi rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
leaving an estimated 35,000 still dispersed there; in Burundi, the
ethnic violence between the Hutus and the Tutsis continued in 1996,
causing an additional 150,000 Hutus to flee to Tanzania, thus raising
their numbers in that country to about 250,000

@Burundi:Economy

Economy-overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country in an
early stage of economic development. The economy is predominately
agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on
subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee
crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability
to pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the
climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic
reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank
support, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports,
attract foreign investment in industry, and modernize government
budgetary practices. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from
massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of
perhaps 100,000 persons and the displacement of a million others.
Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply. An
impoverished and disorganized government can hardly implement the
needed reform programs.

@Cambodia:Economy

Economy-overview: After four years of solid macroeconomic performance,
Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997 due to the twin shocks
of the regional economic crisis and the July violence and political
infighting. Economic growth fell from 6.5% in 1996 to 1.5% in 1997,
foreign investment slowed, and tourism declined 16% from 1996 levels.
Despite these difficulties, inflation accelerated only slightly to
9.5%; the government managed to keep the national budget in balance
even with increased expenditures on the military and police; and the
economy ran a small balance of payments surplus. The future payments
could be adversely affected by the currency crises in Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia, which tends to make Cambodia's exports more
expensive at the same time imports from these countries become
cheaper. The long-term development of the economy after decades of war
remains a daunting challenge. Human resource levels in the population
are low, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside. The almost
total lack of basic infrastructure in the countryside will continue to
hinder development. Recurring political instability hinders foreign
investment. Corruption and inexperience among Cambodia's government
officials will serve as a further drag on the economy.

@Cameroon:Economy

Economy-overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a
top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led to rapid
economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt
in 1986, precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major
exports: petroleum, coffee, and cocoa. Export earnings were cut by
almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal management were
exposed. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and
World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase
efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the
nation's banks. The government, however, failed to press forward
vigorously with these programs. The latest enhanced structural
adjustment agreement was signed in October 1997; the parties hope this
will prove more successful, yet government mismanagement remains a
problem. Inflation, which rose to 48% after the devaluation of 1994,
has been brought back under control. Progress toward privatization of
remaining state industry remains slow. President BIYA's new government
of December 1997 has replaced old hands in the government economic
control structure with promising technocrats.

@Canada:Economy

Economy-overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada
today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system,
pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World War II,
the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into
one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the 1990s in
recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1% so far
this decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces high
unemployment-especially in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces-and a
large public sector debt. With its great natural resources, skilled
labor force, and modern capital plant, however, Canada will enjoy
better economic prospects in the future. The continuing constitutional
impasse between English- and French-speaking areas is raising the
possibility of a split in the federation, making foreign investors
somewhat edgy.

@Cape Verde:Economy

Economy-overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles
of long-term drought, and a high birth rate. The economy is
service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
accounting for almost 70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the
population lives in rural areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in
1995 was only 8%, of which fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of
food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna,
is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
constitute a supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms,
launched by the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at
developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Prospects for 1998 depend heavily on the
maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Introduction

Current issues: In 1996, the Central African Republic experienced
three mutinies by dissident elements of the armed forces, which
demanded back pay as well as political and military reforms.
Continuing violence in 1997 between the government and rebel military
groups over pay issues, living conditions, and lack of opposition
party representation in the government has destroyed many businesses
in the capital, reducing tax revenues and exacerbating the
government's problems in meeting expenses.

@Central African Republic:Economy

Economy-overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted
for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled
work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The
50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,
timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions
and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction
of property and a drop in GDP of 1%. Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living
conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses
in the capital, reduced tax revenues for the government, and delayed
negotiations for an IMF financial aid agreement.

Introduction

Historical perspective: In December 1990, after Chad had endured
decades of civil warfare among ethnic groups as well as invasions by
Libya, former northern guerrilla leader Idriss DEBY seized control of
the government. His transitional government eventually suppressed or
came to terms with most political-military groups, settled the
territorial dispute with Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a
democratic constitution which was ratified by popular referendum in
March 1996, held multiparty national presidential elections in June
and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the vote), and held multiparty
elections for the National Assembly in January and February 1997, in
which Idriss DEBY's party, Patriotic Salvation Movement or MPS, won a
majority of the seats.

@Chad:Economy

Economy-overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers from
it's geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and
political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on agriculture,
including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's Francophone countries,
Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in
January 1994. Financial aid from the World Bank, the African
Development Fund, and other sources is directed largely at the
improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production. Lack of
financing, however, is stalling the development of a southern oil
field and the construction of a proposed oil pipeline through
Cameroon.

@Chile:Economy

Economy-overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market
economy. Civilian governments - which took over from the military in
March 1990-have continued to reduce the government's role in the
economy while shifting the emphasis of public spending toward social
programs. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 7.0% in 1991-1997, and
inflation is nearing a 40-year low. Chile's currency and foreign
reserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital
inflows-including significant direct investment-have more than offset
current account deficits and public debt buybacks. President FREI, who
took office in March 1994, has placed improving Chile's education
system and developing foreign export markets at the top of his
economic agenda. Despite this progress, the Chilean economy remains
largely dependent on a few sectors-particularly copper mining,
fishing, and forestry. Success in meeting the government's goal of
sustained annual economic growth of 5% depends largely on world prices
for these commodities, continued foreign investor confidence, and the
government's ability to maintain a conservative fiscal stance. In
1996, Chile became an associate member of Mercosur and concluded a

@China:Economy

Economy-overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has
been trying to move the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally
planned economy to a more market-oriented economy but still within a
rigid political framework of Communist Party control. To this end the
authorities switched to a system of household responsibility in
agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978.
Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also posted
major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic
and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often
experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains
and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. In 1992-97 annual growth
of GDP accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas-averaging about
10% annually according to official figures. In late 1993 China's
leadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still
more play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the
center's control over the financial system; state enterprises would
continue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed "a
socialist market economy." In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply,
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control
food prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect
revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce
corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large
state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the
vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which have been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million
surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities,
many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,
changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to
maintaining growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to
continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the
environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose
arable land because of erosion and economic development; furthermore,
the regime gives insufficient priority to agricultural research. The
next few years may witness increasing tensions between a highly
centralized political system and an increasingly decentralized
economic system. Rapid economic growth likely will continue but at a
declining rate. Hong Kong's reversion on 1 July 1997 to Chinese
administration will strengthen the already close ties between the two
economies.

from an appreciation of the peso and a recession in neighboring
Venezuela. Although 1997's 3.1% GDP growth rate represented an
improvement over 1996, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America and
was substantially lower than the average annual growth rate exceeding
4% that Colombia posted for several decades prior to SAMPER's
election. Colombia's next president will inherit a variety of economic
problems. Most notably, the unemployment rate is at its highest level
this decade, risks for the export sector and foreign investors are
rising as a result of increasing guerrilla violence and a volatile
exchange rate, and the fiscal deficit has more than tripled since
1994.

COMOROS

Introduction

Historical perspective: Comoros has had difficulty in achieving
political stability, having endured 18 coups or attempted coups since
receiving independence from France in 1975. Most recently, in August
1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their independence
from Comoros. An attempt in September 1997 by the government to
reestablish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and
presently the Organization of African Unity is brokering negotiations
to effect a reconciliation.

Federal Assembly (two from each island) are permitted to be in
opposition, but if no party accomplishes that the second most
successful party will be in opposition; in the elections of December

Njazidja, Nzwani, and Mayotte (a territorial collectivity of France,
but claimed by Comoros); the design, the most recent of several, is
described in the constitution approved by referendum on 7 June 1992

@Comoros:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a
young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a
subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the
economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force,
and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient
in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of
imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and
technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to
promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP
growth is to be maintained in the late 1990s.

@Congo, Democratic Republic of the:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Democratic Republic of the Congo-a
nation endowed with vast potential wealth-has declined significantly
since the mid-1980s. The new government has instituted a tight fiscal
policy that has curbed inflation and currency depreciation. Plans are
underway to introduce a new national currency. Most formal
transactions are conducted in hard currency but a barter economy
flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and
families survive through subsistence farming or petty trade.
International investors show renewed interest, especially in the
mining and telecommunications sectors. However, poor infrastructure,
an uncertain legal framework, corruption and lack of transparency in
government economic policy remain a brake on investment and growth. A
number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the new government
to help it develop a coherent economic plan.

@Congo, Republic of the:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
overstaffing. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing about 90% of government revenues and exports. In
the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to
finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5%
annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, falling
oil prices cut GDP growth by half. Moreover, the government has
mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings, contributing to
the government's shortage of revenues. The 12 January 1994 devaluation
of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 61% in 1994
but inflation has subsided since. Economic reform efforts continue
with the support of international organizations, notably the World
Bank and the IMF.

@Cook Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations, the
Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic
devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure.
Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of
copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made
up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In 1996, the government declared
bankruptcy, citing a $120 million public debt. Efforts to exploit
tourism potential and expanding the mining and fishing industries have
not been enough to adequately deal with the financial crisis. In an
effort to stem further erosion of the economy, the government slashed
public service salaries by 50%, condensed the number of government
ministries from 52 to 22, reduced the number of civil servants by more
than half, began selling government assets, and closed all overseas
diplomatic posts except for the one in New Zealand.

@Costa Rica:Economy

Economy-overview: Costa Rica's basically stable and progressive
economy depends especially on tourism and the export of bananas,
coffee, and other agricultural products. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social
safety net has been put in place. Recent trends, however, have been
disappointing. Economic growth slipped from 4.3% in 1994 to 2.5% in
1995, and to 0.9% in 1996, and then rebounded in 1997 to 3%. Inflation
rose to 22.5% in 1995 from 13.5% in 1994, receded to 17.5% in 1996,
then dropped to 11.2% in 1997. Unemployment appears moderate at 5.7%,
but substantial underemployment continues. Furthermore, substantial
government deficits have undermined efforts to maintain the quality of
social services. The government thus faces a formidable set of
problems: to curb inflation, reduce the deficit, encourage domestic
savings, and improve public sector efficiency while increasing the
role of the private sector, all this in harmony with IMF agreements.
One important positive development-the infusion of more than $200
million in 1997 by microchip giant Intel and the anticipated
attraction of other high-tech firms to Costa Rica will help stimulate
growth and employment over the next several years.

@Cote d'Ivoire:Economy

Economy-overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil. Consequently, the
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices
for these products and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the
government to diversify the economy, it is still largely dependent on
agriculture and related activities, which engage roughly 85% of the
population. After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian
economy began a comeback in 1994, due to improved prices for cocoa and
coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples
and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil and
gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling
by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of Franc Zone
currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation
rate to 26% in 1994, but the rate fell to 7% in 1996 and an estimated
3.4% in 1997. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms
led to a jump in growth rates-6.5% in GDP in 1996 and again in 1997.

@Croatia:Economy

Economy-overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from:
the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage
during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines,
buildings, and houses; the large refugee and displaced population,
both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties.
Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
industries, would help restore the economy. The government has been
successful in some reform efforts-partially macroeconomic
stabilization policies-and it has normalized relations with its
creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large
state enterprises and with bank reform.

@Cuba:Economy

Economy-overview: The state plays the primary role in the economy and
controls practically all foreign trade. The government has undertaken
several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity, increase
labor incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer
goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural markets introduced
in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota
production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to
lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money
supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 23 to
the dollar by yearend 1997. New taxes introduced in 1996 helped drive
down the number of self-employed workers from 208,000 in January 1996
to 176,000 by September 1997. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP
declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and
domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994,
when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995
and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997, to 2.5%, in part due to
a poor sugar harvest. Export earnings declined 3% in 1997, to $1.9
billion, the result of lower sugar export volume and lower world
prices for nickel and sugar. Imports remained unchanged in 1997 at
$3.2 billion. Tourism plays a key role in foreign currency earnings.
The disparity between those at the top of the ladder and those at the
bottom has increased markedly in the past 10 years. Living standards
for the average Cuban remain at a depressed level compared with 1990.

@Cyprus:Economy

Economy-overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small and prosperous,
but highly susceptible to external shocks. Industry contributes 22% to
GDP and employs 25% of the labor force, while the service sector
contributes 73% to GDP and employs 62% of the labor force. Erratic
growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's vulnerability to
swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the
island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe. The
Turkish Cypriot economy has about one-third the per capita GDP of the
south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much
difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have
hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service, which together employ about half
of the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has
suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for
the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to
nearly every sector. In January 1997, Turkey signed a $250 million
economic cooperation accord with the Turkish Cypriot area to support
tourism, education, and industry.

@Czech Republic:Economy

Economy-overview: Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered the
Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of
post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure
to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in
Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May.
The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors
worried that the current account deficit, which reached about 8% of
GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in
vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The
growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand
and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity.
The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough 1998
budget continues the painful medicine. These problems were compounded
in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which inundated much
of the eastern part of the country. Czech difficulties in 1997
contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP growth, a balanced
budget, and inflation and unemployment that were among the lowest in
the region. The Czech economy's transition problems continue to be too
much direct and indirect government influence on the privatized
economy, the sometimes ineffective management of privatized firms, and
a shortage of experienced financial analysts for the banking system.

@Denmark:Economy

Economy-overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry,
extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards,
and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of
food. The center-left coalition government will concentrate on
reducing the persistently high unemployment rate and the budget
deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition
also vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered
marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted
industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms and
increased research and development funds; and improved welfare
services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime
Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms focus on adapting Denmark to the criteria
for European integration by 1999; Copenhagen has won from the European
Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
Denmark is, in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into
the EMU on time. Growth may fall off slightly to 2.8% in 1998, and
inflation may rise to 2.5%.

@Djibouti:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based on service activities connected
with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone
in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be
imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of
payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of
40% to 50% continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption
dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because of
recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including
immigrants and refugees). Faced with a multitude of economic
difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term
external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
foreign aid donors.

@Dominica:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is
highly vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 26% of GDP and employs
40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped out
one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The government is attempting
to develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
island's production base.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic reforms launched in late 1994 contributed
to exchange rate stabilization, reduced inflation, and strong GDP
growth in 1995-96. In 1996, there was increased mineral and petroleum
exploration, and a new investment law that allows for repatriation of
capital dividends has drawn more investment to the island. Upon coming
to power in August 1996, President FERNANDEZ nevertheless inherited a
trouble-ridden economy hampered by a pressured peso, a large external
debt, nearly bankrupt state-owned enterprises, and a manufacturing
sector hindered by daily power outages. In December, FERNANDEZ
presented a bold economic reform package-including such reforms as the
devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales
taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices-in an
attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete
internationally. Even though reforms are moving ahead at a slow pace,
the economy grew vigorously in 1997, with tourism and
telecommunications leading the advance. The government is working to
increase electric generating capacity, a key to continued economic
growth.

@Ecuador:Economy

Economy-overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. As an exporter of primary products such as oil,
bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can have a
substantial domestic impact. Growth has been uneven in recent years as
the government has repeatedly initiated ill-conceived fiscal
stabilization measures. The populist government of Abdala BUCARAM
Ortiz proposed a major currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent
with new austerity measures and rampant official corruption undermined
his government's position. Congress replaced BUCARAM with Fabian
ALARCON in February 1997. ALARCON has adopted a minimalist economic
program that puts off major decisions until the next elected
government takes office in August 1998. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments. Growth slowed to 2.0% in 1996, due to a lack of
investment caused by political uncertainty and high domestic interest
rates, but economic activity picked up in 1997. Exports and economic
growth in 1998 may be adversely affected by lower world oil prices
and, to a smaller extent, by El Nino.

@Egypt:Economy

Economy-overview: At the end of the 1980s, Egypt faced problems of low
productivity and poor economic management, compounded by the adverse
social effects of excessive population growth, high inflation, and
massive urban overcrowding. In the face of these pressures, in 1991
Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform measures. This reform effort has been supported by
three successive IMF arrangements, the last of which was concluded in
October 1996. Egypt's reform efforts-and its participation in the Gulf
war coalition-also led to massive debt relief under the Paris Club
arrangements. Although the pace of reform has been uneven and slower
than envisaged under the IMF programs, substantial progress has been
made in improving macroeconomic performance. Budget deficits have been
slashed while foreign reserves in 1997 were at an all-time high. And
Egypt has been moving toward a more decentralized, market-oriented
economy. These economic reforms and growing investment opportunities
have prompted increasing foreign investment, but incoming capital has
largely been concentrated in stock market portfolio flows. Egypt's
economy also has been hit by a sharp downturn in tourism-a key foreign
exchange and job producing sector-following the 17 November 1997
massacre of foreign tourists at Luxor. Although Egypt will probably
regain these revenues over time, the slump in tourism is likely to
slow the GDP growth rate in 1998.

@El Salvador:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the government emphasized a fixed exchange
rate, along with conservative monetary and fiscal policies to promote
foreign investment. Inflation fell to an unprecedented low of 2%.
Exports reached a record level and were the main engine of growth.
Productivity in other sectors remained weaker, however. For the last
few years, El Salvador has experienced sizable deficits in both its
trade and its fiscal accounts. The trade deficit has been offset by
remittances from the large number of Salvadorans living abroad and
from external aid. The deficit is expected to increase in 1998 as
imports continue to rise. San Salvador is stepping up its
privatization efforts in 1998 to increase revenues. Late in 1997 the
legislative assembly approved a privatization law that will facilitate
the sale of the state-owned telephone company sometime in 1998. The
government also plans to privatize pension funds later in the year.

@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves
have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Farming,
forestry, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the
deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid
programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
since 1993 because of the government's gross corruption and
mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government
officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources
include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. The
country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994.

ERITREA

Introduction

Historical perspective: On 29 May 1991, ISAIAS Afworki, secretary
general of the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which
then served as the country's legislative body, announced the formation
of the Provisional Government in Eritrea (PGE) in preparation for the
23-25 April 1993 referendum on independence for the Autonomous Region
of Eritrea; the referendum resulted in a landslide vote for
independence, which was proclaimed on 27 April 1993.

established by former colonial powers, would consist of only six
provinces when the new constitution, then being drafted, would go into

not been recommended by the US Board on Geographic Names for
recognition by the US government, pending acceptable definition of the
boundaries, were: Anseba, Debub, Debubawi Keyih Bahri, Gash-Barka,
Maakel, and Semanawi Keyih Bahri; more recently, it has been reported

@Eritrea:Economy

Economy-overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993,
Eritrea faced the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately
poor African country. The economy is largely based on subsistence
agriculture, with over 70% of the population involved in farming and
herding. The small industrial sector consists mainly of light
industries with outmoded technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is
substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government
revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and sales. Road
construction is a top domestic priority. Eritrea has inherited the
entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for revenues
from the development of offshore oil fields, offshore fishing, and
tourism. Eritrea's economic future depends on its ability to master
fundamental social and economic problems, e.g., overcoming illiteracy,
promoting job creation, expanding technical training, attracting
foreign investment, and streamlining the bureaucracy.

@Estonia:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 Estonia's continued implementation of market
economic reforms, disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, and a
liberal free trade regime resulted in GDP growth of 10% and a drop in
inflation to 11.2%. Estonia can point to its inclusion among the first
group of Central and East European countries to begin EU accession
talks in 1998 as its most significant economic achievement in 1997.
Other economic strengths include solid investment grade rating from
both Standard and Poors and Moody's, government revenue collection in
excess of projections by more than 6%, growth in exports at a faster
rate than imports, and record levels of foreign direct investment,
among the highest per capita in Central and East Europe. Estonia
privatized its shipping company in 1997, but failed to make as much
progress privatizing other large infrastructure/utility companies,
such as Eesti Energia and the Oil Shale company, which it plans to
privatize in the next two years. The growing current account deficit,
which stood at nearly 10% of GDP at yearend 1997, remains a serious
concern. In 1998, GDP is expected to grow by 5.5% and inflation to
fall 10%.

@Ethiopia:Economy

Economy-overview: Ethiopia remains one of the poorest and least
developed countries in the world. Its economy is based on agriculture,
which accounts for more than half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of
total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
less than 10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is
considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants and is
implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
during years of civil strife.

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas):Economy

Economy-overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
mainly sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs most of the
work force. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK
and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So
far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987, when the
government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone; overfishing is
a growing problem. These license fees total more than $40 million per
year and support the island's health, education, and welfare system.
To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has
built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and
trout fishing. The islands are now self-financing except for defense.
The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration
zone around the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest
substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day. An
agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse
licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest
in exploiting potential oil reserves.

@Faroe Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The Faroese economy in 1995 and 1996 saw a
noticeable upturn after several years of decline brought on by a drop
in fish catches and declining prices and by over-spending by the
Faroese Home Rule Government (FHRG). In the early 1990s, property
values plummeted, and the FHRG had to bail out and merge the two
largest Faroese banks. Fishing is now improving; wage costs are
increasing; the FHRG's budget is almost in balance; and the large
foreign debt has come down significantly. Nevertheless, the total
dependence on fishing makes the Faroese economy extremely vulnerable,
and the reduction in the foreign debt is at the cost of low
investment. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits
in the immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for an eventual
economic rebound. The Faroese are supported by a substantial annual
subsidy from Denmark.

@Fiji:Economy

Economy-overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports
and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign
exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity.
Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and
drought, however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings
from tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers.
Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because the sugar industry suffered from
low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners.

@Finland:Economy

Economy-overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is
manufacturing-principally the wood, metals, and engineering
industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing
about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products.
Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation
for the rural population. The economy has come back from the recession
of 1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed
foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between
Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had
been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finns voted in an
October 1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined
the Union on 1 January 1995. Attempts to cut the unacceptably high
rate of unemployment and increasing integration with Western Europe
will dominate the economic picture over the next few years. Despite
high unemployment and moderate GDP growth of 3.9% anticipated for
1998, inflation is forecast to rise to 2.5%

@France:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the four West European trillion-dollar
economies, France matches a growing services sector with a diversified
industrial base and substantial agricultural resources. Services now
account for more than 70% of GDP, while industry generates about
one-quarter of GDP and more than 80% of export earnings. The
government retains considerable influence over key segments of each
sector, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, and
telecommunication firms. It nevertheless has been slowly relaxing its
control over these sectors since the early 1990s, most recently
selling 23% of France Telecom. The government also plans to sell its
stakes in Air France and in the insurance, banking, and defense
industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of fertile land, the application
of modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make France the
leading agricultural producer in Western Europe. A major exporter of
wheat and dairy products, France is virtually self-sufficient in
agriculture. The economy expanded by 2.3% last year, following a 1.3%
gain in 1996. Persistently high unemployment still poses a major
problem for the government, however, as does the need to control
government spending to keep the economy internationally competitive
and meet membership qualifications for the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) which is slated to introduce a common European
currency in January 1999. Succeeding governments have shied away from
cutting exceptionally generous social welfare benefits or the enormous
state bureaucracy, preferring to pare defense spending and raise taxes
to keep the deficit down. The JOSPIN administration has pledged both
to lower unemployment and bring France into EMU, pinning its hopes for
new jobs on economic growth and on legislation to gradually reduce the
workweek from 39 to 35 hours by 2002.

@French Guiana:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities, with exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp)
accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large
reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export.
Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the
population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent
on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
particularly among younger workers.

@French Polynesia:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel
in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy
to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed
by the military or supports the tourist industry. Tourism accounts for
about 20% of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings.
The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural
products. The territory will continue to benefit from a five-year
(1994-98) development agreement with France aimed principally at
creating new jobs.

@Gabon:Economy

Economy-overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of
most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp decline
in extreme poverty but because of high income inequality a large
proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on timber
and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s.
The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to face
fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium
exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth and a manageable rate
of population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal
management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and
Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a
cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private
creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12
January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate
dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement
in 1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near
commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate
progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided
additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF
targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon chastened the
government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing from
the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and
administrative reform (such as reduced public sector employment and
salary growth).

@Gambia, The:Economy

Economy-overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood.
Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts,
fish, and hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment
of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and hurt the
reexport trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in tourism
after its decline in response to the military's takeover in July 1994.
Short-run economic progress remains highly dependent on sustained
bilateral and multilateral aid and on responsible government economic
management.

GAZA STRIP

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996, but have
not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to
transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative Council elected in
January 1996, as part of interim self-governing arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in
additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement and the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997
Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron. The DOP provides that
Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for
external security and for internal security and public order of
settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined through
direct negotiations.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic progress in the Gaza Strip has been
hampered by tight Israeli security restrictions. In 1991 roughly 40%
of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by Israeli
industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50%. Gaza has depended upon
Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. The Persian Gulf crisis
and its aftershocks have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker
remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment and
popular unrest have increased, and living standards have fallen. The
redeployment of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip in May 1994 has added
to the set of adjustment problems. This series of disruptions has
meant a sharp decline in employment in Israel since 1991 and a drop in
GDP as a whole. An estimated 378,000 persons were in refugee camps in
1996.

GEORGIA

Introduction

Current issues: Beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence in
1991, Georgia began to stabilize in 1994. Separatist conflicts in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been dormant since spring 1994,
although political settlements remain elusive. Russian peacekeepers
are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer Mission is operating in
Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts, Georgia still has about
250,000 internally displaced people. In 1995, Georgia adopted a new
constitution and conducted generally free and fair nationwide
presidential and parliamentary elections. In 1996, the government
focused its attention to implementing an ambitious economic reform
program and professionalizing its parliament. Violence and organized
crime were sharply curtailed in 1995 and 1996, but corruption remains
rife. In 1997, SHEVARDNADZE succeeded in bringing international
attention to the Abkhazia conflict. The UN sponsored two meetings on
the subject, but a resolution is still far off. Georgia also took some
steps in 1997 to reduce its dependence on Russia, acquiring coastal
patrol boats it hopes to use to replace the current Russian border
units on the Black Sea coast. The year 1997 also saw a sharpening of
rhetoric-especially from parliament-against Russia's continued
military presence on Georgian territory.

@Georgia:Economy

Economy-overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around
Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes;
mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial
sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The
country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas
and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy resource is
hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has suffered due to
civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and World Bank, has
made substantial economic gains in 1995-97, increasing GDP growth and
slashing inflation. Georgia still suffers from energy shortages,
although energy deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning
its hopes for long-term recovery on the development of an
international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports
of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline
through Georgia-scheduled to open in early 1999-should spur greater
western investment in the economy. A growing trade deficit, continuing
problems with corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the
short-term economic picture.

@Germany:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the German economy, the world's third most
powerful, benefited from robust exports, particularly to other members
of the EU and the US, as well as strengthening equipment investment.
But anemic private consumption and a contraction in the construction
industry limited the expansion. Unemployment continued to set post-war
monthly records through the end of 1997 and averaged 4.3 million for
the year. In preparation for the 1 January 1999 start of the European
Monetary Union, the government has made major efforts in 1996-97 to
reduce the fiscal deficit. This effort has been complicated by growing
unemployment, an erosion of the tax base, and the continuing transfer
of roughly $100 billion a year to eastern Germany to refurbish this
ex-communist area. In recent years business and political leaders have
become increasingly concerned about Germany's decline in
attractiveness as an investment target. They cite increasing
preference by German companies to locate new manufacturing facilities
in foreign countries, including the US, rather than in Germany, to be
closer to the markets and to avoid Germany's high tax rates, high wage
costs, rigid labor structures, and extensive regulations. For similar
reasons foreign investment in Germany has been lagging in recent
years.

@Ghana:Economy

Economy-overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has twice
the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa. Even so,
Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 41% of GDP and
employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97,
Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi,
and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures.

@Gibraltar:Economy

Economy-overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now
contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism (more than 5 million visitors in
1995), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also
generate revenue. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the
public sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on
the level of employment.

@Greece:Economy

Economy-overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for roughly half of GDP. Tourism provides a
major portion of foreign exchange. Greece is among the poorest EU
countries in terms of per capita income; Athens continues to rely
heavily on EU aid, which currently amounts to about 4.5% of GDP.
Macroeconomic problems include the huge public sector, substantial
budget and balance of payments deficits, and 10% unemployment.
Economic growth is strengthening, and the government's strict fiscal
and monetary policies are responsible for the decline in inflation and
the budget deficit. Despite widespread protests from labor unions and
farmers over austerity, the government is taking further steps to
enhance revenue collection and reduce expenditures to prepare Greece
for participation in the EU's single currency by 2001. Greece entered
the exchange rate mechanism-a requirement for European Monetary Union
(EMU) membership-in March 1998. GDP growth is projected at 3.5% for

@Greenland:Economy

Economy-overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland
Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

@Grenada:Economy

Economy-overview: The agriculturally based economy was hurt in 1996 by
the emergence of the pink mealy bug, which destroyed much of the cocoa
harvest. Bananas, a major foreign exchange earner, also suffered due
to falling prices, low production, and poor quality. Tourism, the
leading foreign exchange earner, continued to do well, as did
manufacturing. Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low
and middle income mortgages. The government introduced a 5% tax on
electricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax,
which caused a small rise in the inflation rate. The tourist industry
faces stiff competition over the next few years.

@Guadeloupe:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
from the US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by
other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are
cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.

are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam faces the problem of
building up the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of
military downsizing.

@Guatemala:Economy

Economy-overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth of
GDP and two-thirds of exports and employs more than half of the labor
force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products. Manufacturing
and construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since assuming office
in January 1996, President ARZU has worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization. The signing of
the Peace Accords in December 1996, which ended 36 years of civil war,
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. In 1997, Guatemala met
its economic targets when GDP growth accelerated to 4.1% and inflation
fell to 9%. The government also increased tax revenues-historically
the lowest in Latin America-to 9% of GDP and created a new tax
administration. It also successfully placed $150 million in
dollar-denominated notes in the international markets. Debt service
costs should decline in 1998. Remaining challenges for the
administration in 1998 include completing a deal with the IMF and
stabilizing monetary policy. Throughout 1997, the Central Bank
maintained a tight money supply, helping to control inflation, but it
also caused high interest rates and led to operating losses for the
bank. Early in 1998, it relaxed its monetary policy in an effort to
correct these problems, but increased pressure on the quetzal has
prompted the bank to intervene to prop up its value.

@Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: Although possessing major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in
the world. The agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force.
Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
second largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about
75% of exports in 1995. Long-run improvements in government fiscal
arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
country is to move out of poverty. The government made encouraging
progress in budget management in 1997. Except in the mining industry,
foreign investment remains minimal.

@Guinea-Bissau:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the 20 poorest countries in the world,
Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks sixth
in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along
with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the
major crop and staple food. Trade reform and price liberalization are
the most successful part of the country's structural adjustment
program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and
the development of the private sector have begun to reinvigorate the
economy. Inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter of 1997.
Membership in the WAMU (West African Monetary Union), begun in May
1997, should help support 5% annual growth and contribute to fiscal
discipline. Because of high costs, the development of petroleum,
phosphate, and other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect.

@Guyana:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997, Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the
Western Hemisphere, posted its sixth straight year of economic growth
of 5% or better, with the advance led by gold and bauxite mining and
by sugar growing. Favorable growth factors have included expansion in
the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a moderate
inflation rate, and the continued support of international
organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
barrier to future gains in national output. The government must
persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and extend its
privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

Economy-overview: About 75% of the population lives in abject poverty.
Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, which
consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs about
two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country has
experienced little or no job creation since President PREVAL took
office in February 1996, although the informal economy is growing.
Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors have denied
Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance. Meeting aid
conditions in 1998 will be especially challenging in the face of
mounting popular criticism of reforms.

@Honduras:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1994 the REINA administration inherited an
economy in the grips of stagflation due to an unprecedented energy
crisis, declining agricultural output, and extravagant public
expenditures. In response the REINA administration cut the fiscal
deficit and enacted a number of structural reforms including passage
of a modern financial sector reform law in 1995 and a central bank
reform law in 1996. As a result, Honduras finished 1997 with improved
GDP growth and a decreasing rate of inflation. The newly elected
FLORES administration faces pressure from the international financial
community and the IMF to further decrease the fiscal deficit and
implement key reforms, including the privatization of state
enterprises such as Hondutel. Tegucigalpa will probably implement
tighter fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation low and meet
commitments to the IMF. This may slow GDP growth to 3.5% in 1998.
Moreover, wage increases for public-sector employees, agreed to in
1997, will make it difficult for FLORES to make headway on the fiscal
deficit and inflation.

@Hong Kong:Economy

Economy-overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy highly
dependent on international trade. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports and exports,
including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value. Real GDP growth
averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and
picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994,
4.8% in 1995, 4.7% in 1996, and an estimated 5.5% in 1997. A shortage
of labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of
living. Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1
July 1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China.

@Hungary:Economy

Economy-overview: Hungary has consolidated its March 1995
stabilization program and undergone enough restructuring to become an
established market economy. The country appears to have entered a
period of sustainable growth, gradually falling inflation, and stable
external balances. The government's main economic priorities are to
complete structural reforms, particularly the implementation of the
1997 pension reform act (the first in the region), taxation reform,
and planning for comprehensive health care, local government finance
reform, and the reform of education at all levels. Foreign investment
has totaled more than $17 billion through 1997. In recognition of
Hungary's improved macro-economic situation, all major credit-rating
agencies listed the country's foreign currency debt issuances as
investment grade in 1996. The current IMF stand-by arrangement expired
in February 1998, and Budapest and the IMF agree that there is no need
to renew it. The OECD welcomed Hungary as a member in May 1996, and in
December 1997 the EU invited Hungary to begin the accession process.

@Iceland:Economy

Economy-overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources-except energy-Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing
world fish prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish
stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports: fish
and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying
the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Growth is
likely to slow in 1998, to a still respectable 3.9%.

@India:Economy

Economy-overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. 67% of India's labor
force of nearly 400 million work in agriculture, which contributes 30%
of the country's GDP. Production, trade, and investment reforms since
1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an
estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided
debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived
confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the
country's fundamentals - including savings rates (26% of GDP) and
reserves (now about $24 billion) - are healthy. Inflation eased to 7%
in 1997, and interest rates dropped to between 10% and 13%. Even so,
the Indian Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform,
especially by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining
government regulations. Moreover, economic policy changes have not yet
significantly increased jobs or reduced the risk that international
financial strains will reemerge within the next few years. Nearly 40%
of the Indian population remains too poor to afford an adequate diet.
India's exports, currency, and foreign institutional investment were
affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and early 1998, but
capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt to reserves,
and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped insulate it
from near term balance-of-payments problems. Export growth, has been
slipping in 1996-97, averaging only about 4% to 5%-a large drop from
the more than 20% increases it was experiencing over the prior three
years-mainly because of the fall in Asian currencies relative to the
rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and transportation shortages and
the legacy of inefficient factories constrain industrial growth which
expanded only 6.7% in 1997-down from more than 11% in 1996. Growth of
the agricultural sector is still fairly slow rebounding to only 5.7%
in 1997 from a fall of 0.1% in 1996. Agricultural investment has
slowed, while costly subsidies on fertilizer, food distribution, and
rural electricity remain. Nevertheless, even if a series of weak
coalition governments continue to rule in New Delhi over the next few
years and are unable to push reforms aggressively, parts of the
economy that have already benefited from deregulation will continue to
grow. Indian think tanks project GDP growth of at least 5.5% in 1998.

INDIAN OCEAN

@Indian Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, Antarctica, Asia, and
Australia

Geographic coordinates: 30 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references: World

Area:
total: 73.6 million sq km
note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Great
Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Mozambique Channel,
Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other tributary water
bodies

Area-comparative: slightly less than eight times the size of the US;
third-largest ocean (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but
larger than the Arctic Ocean)

Coastline: 66,526 km

Climate: northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon
(June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in
the southern Indian Ocean

Terrain: surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular
system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air
results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and
currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean
Ridge, and Ninety East Ridge

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel
aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Natural hazards: ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme
south near Antarctica from May to October

@Indian Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are
being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and
western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil
production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy
minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by
bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand.

@Indonesia:Economy

Economy-overview: While Indonesia was long touted for its sound
macroeconomic management and spectacular growth, the Asian financial
crisis in 1997/98 revealed the weak underpinnings of the economy: an
unhealthy banking sector, untenable levels of private foreign debt,
and uncompetitive practices that favored the financial interests of
former President SOEHARTO's family and friends. Indonesia sought IMF
assistance early in the crisis and eventually brokered a $42 billion
bailout package; but Jakarta jeopardized the program by resisting
strict IMF reforms, partly in response to the rupiah's collapse, which
lost as much as 80% of its value at one point. Economic prospects look
bleak for 1998: the economy probably will shrink between 4% to 10%,
unemployment top historic highs-in excess of 15%-and inflation move
toward hyper levels.

@Iran:Economy

Economy-overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
Newly elected President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market
reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he
will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy. In the
early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis and was forced to
reschedule $15 billion in debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt
service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997 and
early 1998 because of lower oil prices. Iran may be forced to decrease
imports and slow debt repayments if the oil market worsens further.

Disputes-international: Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in
1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; Iran occupies two islands
in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb (called Tunb as
Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in Persian by
Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in Arabic by UAE and
Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); it jointly administers
with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (called
Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by
Iran)-over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control
since 1992, including access restrictions and a military build-up on
the island; the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the
region in protesting these Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are
not yet determined among Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and

@Iraq:Economy

Economy-overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade
while leaving some small-scale industry and services and most
agriculture to private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by
the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign
exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic embargoes, and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
the economic picture. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced
exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices.
The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so
that the economic embargo could be removed. The government's policies
of supporting large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated
shortages. Industrial and transportation facilities, which suffered
severe damage, have been partially restored. At current prices, oil
exports are about one-third of their prewar level because of the
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986-the UN's
oil-for-goods program-in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts
continue. In accord with the oil-for-goods deal, Iraq is allowed to
export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and
medicine. The first oil was pumped in December 1996, and the first
supplies of food and medicine arrived in April 1997. Per capita output
for 1995-97 and living standards are well below the 1989-90 level, but
any estimates have a wide range of error.

Disputes-international: Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in
1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 1994, Iraq
formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been
spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to
Bubiyan and Warbah islands; dispute over water development plans by
Turkey for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers

@Ireland:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is small and trade dependent.
Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by
industry, which accounts for 38% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and
employs 27% of the labor force. Although exports remain the primary
engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting
from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and
business investment. Since the 1980s, inflation has fallen sharply and
chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.
Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is
the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin
aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.

with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October
1991, bilateral negotiations are being conducted between Israel and
Palestinian representatives, and Israel and Syria, to achieve a
permanent settlement between them. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew
from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace treaty.
Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved
in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

direct election of the prime minister; under the new law, each voter
casts two ballots-one for the direct election of the prime minister
and one for the party in the Knesset; the candidate that receives the
largest percentage of the popular vote then works to form a coalition
with other parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats;
finally, the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset
for approval and this must be done within 45 days of the election; in
contrast to the old system, under the new law, the prime minister's

@Israel:Economy

Economy-overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of
crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite
limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli workers;
agriculture, forestry, and fishing only 2.6%; and services the rest.
Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
sizable current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the
government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major
source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange,
Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in international
markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish
immigrants from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period
1989-97, bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet
Union to one million, or one-sixth of the total population. Initially
this great influx increased unemployment, intensified housing
problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
immigrants bring to the economy scientific and professional expertise
of substantial value for the future.

@Italy:Economy

Economy-overview: Since World War II, the Italian economy has changed
from one based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK. This basically capitalistic economy is still divided into a
developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less
developed agricultural south, with large public enterprises and more
than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
75% of energy requirements must be imported. In the second half of
1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to
participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the
decade; thus, it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances.
Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets,
abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system, and started to
scale back its generous social welfare programs, including pension and
health care benefits. In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European
monetary system, which it had left in September 1992 when under
extreme pressure in currency markets. Italy faces the problem of
restructuring its economy to meet Maastricht criteria for inclusion in
the EMU, together with other problems of refurbishing a tottering
communications system, curbing industrial pollution, and adjusting to
new EU and global competitive forces.

@Jamaica:Economy

Economy-overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation and stabilize the exchange rate,
but have resulted in the slow-down of economic growth (moving from
1.5% in 1992 to 0.5% in 1995. In 1996, GDP was in negative growth
(-1.4%) and remained so in 1997. Serious problems include: high
interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial
condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment
portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a
pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise
trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy. Jamaica's medium-term prospects
will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive sectors,
maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the labor
environment, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary policies.

@Japan:Economy

Economy-overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (roughly 1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with
extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
the world. One notable characteristic of the economy is the working
together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely knit
groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important sector
of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and
protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually
self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been
spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in 1992-95
largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late
1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in 1997
growth fell back to 1%. As a result of the expansionary fiscal
policies and declining tax revenues due to the recession, Japan has
one of the largest budget deficits as a percent of GDP among the
industrialized countries. The crowding of habitable land area and the
aging of the population are two other major long-run problems.

@Jersey:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and
especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the
UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU
countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In
recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate
in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material
and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
Jersey's food needs. Light tax and death duties make the island a
popular tax haven.

@Jordan:Economy

Economy-overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil and coal.
Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
average of roughly 2% per year. Imports-mainly oil, capital goods,
consumer durables, and food-outstripped exports, with the difference
covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian
Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to
implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the
budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated
Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to
shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,
producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
from the Gulf, but recovery was uneven in 1994-97. The government is
implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and continues to
secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign debt. Debt,
poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going problems.

@Kazakhstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years. The emigration of
large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians from the
northern industrial areas will hold back future growth.

@Kenya:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1993, the government of Kenya has implemented
a program of economic liberalization and reform. Steps have included
the removal of import licensing and price controls, removal of foreign
exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint, and reduction of the
public sector through privatizing publicly owned companies and
downsizing the civil service. With the support of the World Bank, IMF,
and other donors, these reforms have led to a turnaround in economic
performance following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s.
Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation
remained under control. Growth slowed in 1997. Political violence
damaged the tourist industry, and the IMF allowed Kenya's Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Program to lapse due to the government's failure
to enact reform conditions and to adequately address public sector
corruption. Moreover, El Nino rains destroyed crops and damaged an
already crumbling infrastructure in 1997 and on into 1998. Long-term
barriers to development include electricity shortages, the
government's continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors,
endemic corruption, and the country's high population growth rate.

@Kiribati:Economy

Economy-overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has
declined from about 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995 and 1.9% in
1996. Growth in 1997 was expected to parallel the 1996 performance.
Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers,
weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The
financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the
expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial aid,
largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, equal
in amount to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years. Remittances from workers
abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

@Korea, North:Economy

Economy-overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces
95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is
unusually tight even for a communist country because of the small size
and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in
the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the
period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an average of
4%-5% or more annually during 1989-97 because of systemic problems and
disruptions in economic and technological links with the former USSR
and China. The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level
of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious
drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector
have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production.
Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of
industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing is centered
on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
is not yet self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of
arable lands, several years of poor harvests, systemic inefficiencies,
a cumbersome distribution system, and extensive floods in 1995-96
followed by a severe drought in 1997 have resulted in increasingly
serious food shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and
South Korea are offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea
remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living
standards.

@Korea, South:Economy

Economy-overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South Korea
has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago its GDP
per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of
Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is eight times India's, 15
times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government business ties, including directed credit,
import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong
labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings and
investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997/98
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
and an undisciplined financial sector. Also, a number of private
sector conglomerates are near bankruptcy. At yearend 1997, an
international effort, spearheaded by the IMF, was underway to shore up
reserves and stabilize the economy. Growth in 1998 will be sharply
cut. Long-term growth will depend on how successfully South Korea
implements planned economic reforms that would bolster the financial
sector, improve corporate management, and open the economy further to
foreign participation.

@Kuwait:Economy

Economy-overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels-10% of world
reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
crude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996.
Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues, and
75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no
arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the
exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%
of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high
per capita income, Kuwait provides its citizens with extensive health,
educational, and retirement benefits. The bulk of the work force is
non-Kuwaiti, living at a considerably lower level. Per capita military
expenditures are among the highest in the world. The economy improved
moderately in 1994-97, with the growth in industry and finance. The
World Bank has urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization,
including in the oil industry, but the government will move slowly on
opening the petroleum sector.

@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan has been one of the
most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying out
market reforms. Following a successful stabilization program, which
lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997, attention is
turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in
enterprises has been sold. Drops in production have been severe since
the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995
production began to recover and exports began to increase. Pensioners,
unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears
continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in
the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97.

@Laos:Economy

Economy-overview: The government of Laos-one of the few remaining
official communist states-has been decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from
an extremely low base, have been striking - growth averaged 7% in
1988-96. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand, it
fell victim to the financial crisis in the region in 1997, when growth
was a mere 1.5%. Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and
limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant
crop is glutinous rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient
overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought
cause shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable
future the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and
other international sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral
aid donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut
sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil
erosion will hamper efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth.

@Latvia:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 Latvia scored the most impressive economic
achievements since independence in 1991, with GDP growing by 6% and
inflation at 7.4%. GDP is expected to grow 5% in 1998 and inflation to
range between 6% and 7%. In 1997 Latvia continued its strict fiscal
policy and apparently ended the year with a small fiscal surplus,
reflecting higher-than-expected income from customs revenues, excise
and business taxes, and restraints on government spending. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) in 1997 was a record $880 million by yearend.
Prospects for increasing FDI in 1998 are good if Latvia privatizes at
least some of its large companies, including Venspils Nafta (the state
oil company). Although Latvia was disappointed that it was not
included among the five Central and East European states invited to
start EU accession talks in spring 1998, it is likely to join the WTrO
in 1998. Latvia's growing current account and trade deficits remain a
cause for concern, reaching nearly 10% by yearend. Latvia's trade
deficit may even reach 22% of GDP in 1998.

LEBANON

Introduction

Current issues: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
the end of the devastating 16-year civil war, which began in 1975.
Under the Ta'if Accord-the blueprint for national reconciliation-the
Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since
the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed five cabinets and
conducted two legislative elections. Most of the militias have been
weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
central government authority over about one-half of the country.
Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains most of its weapons.
Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, the Army
of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
Jazzin. Syria maintains about 25,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops
are based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.
Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's
civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of
the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese Government to
implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord,
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

@Lebanon:Economy

Economy-overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since Prime
Minister HARIRI launched his $18 billion "Horizon 2000" reconstruction
program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic
activity. During 1992-97, annual inflation fell from more than 170% to
9%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign
payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively
stable. Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn
physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is
managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central business district; the
stock market reopened in January 1996; and international banks and
insurance companies are returning. The government nonetheless faces
serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting
borrowing. The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern
Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities that would disrupt vital
capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor has
widened since HARIRI took office, resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

@Lesotho:Economy

Economy-overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from miners employed
in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined steadily
over the past five years; in 1996 their remittances added about 33% to
GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. Manufacturing
depends largely on farm products which support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries. Recent foreign investments will enable
Lesotho to export garments made from imported textiles. Although
drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,
completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits
the sale of water to South Africa and will support the economy's
continued expansion. The pace of the privatization of state-owned
firms increased toward the end of 1994.

LIBERIA

Introduction

Current issues: The Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of civil
warfare in Liberia. More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000 factional
fighters gave up their arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring Group of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG). Free and open
presidential and legislative elections were held 19 July 1997; former
faction leader, Charles TAYLOR, and his National Patriotic Party won
overwhelming victories. The years of civil strife coupled with the
flight of most business people disrupted formal economic activity, but
with peace restored and a popularly-elected government installed, the
difficult task of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this
war-torn country can proceed.

@Liberia:Economy

Economy-overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
them. Some returned during 1997. Many will not return. Richly endowed
with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been
small in scope. The democratically elected government, installed in
August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depends on
continued disarmament of factions and the implementation of sound
macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government.

@Libya:Economy

Economy-overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-third of GDP. Per capita GDP is the
highest in Africa at $6,700, but disproportionately little of national
income flows down to the lower orders of society. GDP growth
fluctuates sharply in response to changes in the world oil market; GDP
has either contracted or grown very sluggishly since 1992. Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have
expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the
production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor
force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,
and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN sanctions
imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on the economy
although they have increased transaction and transportation costs.

@Liechtenstein:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes-the maximum tax rate is 18%-and
easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area
(an organization serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) since May
1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

@Lithuania:Economy

Economy-overview: Lithuania has benefited from its disciplined
approach to market reform and its adherence to strict fiscal and
monetary policies imposed by the IMF, measures that have helped
constrain the growth of the money supply, reduce inflation to 8.6%,
and support GDP growth of 6% in 1997. Inflation is expected to fall in
1998 to 6% and GDP to grow at close to 7%. Foreign direct investment
in 1997 of some $430 million pushed the country over the $1 billion
mark, the first Baltic state to reach this milestone. However, the
current account deficit has hovered around 8% to 10% of GDP annually
since 1995-the result of greater demand for consumer goods and falling
growth in exports.

GDP: purchasing power parity-$15.4 billion (1997 est.)

@Luxembourg:Economy

Economy-overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Agriculture is based on
small family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently
dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified. During
the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking,
account for a growing proportion of the economy. Luxembourg
participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
financial matters, is also closely connected economically to the
Netherlands, and, as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the
open European market.

export earnings; the gambling industry probably represents over 40% of
GDP. Macau depends on China for most of its food, fresh water, and
energy imports. Japan and Hong Kong are the main suppliers of raw
materials and capital goods.

@Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of:Economy

Economy-overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although
the poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic
food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources.
The economy slowly rebounded in 1996-97 after years of recession.
Continued recovery depends on Macedonia's ability to attract
investment, to redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and
Montenegro, and to maintain its commitment to economic liberalization.
The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and
most of its modern machinery and parts. An important supplement of GDP
is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians working in Germany
and other West European nations.

Bulgarian; the border commission formed by The Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro in April 1996 to
resolve differences in delineation of their mutual border has made no
progress so far; Albanians in Macedonia claim discrimination in
education, access to public-sector jobs and representation in
government; Party for Democratic Action (DPA) calls for a rewrite of
the constitution to declare ethnic Albanians a national group and
allow for regional autonomy

@Madagascar:Economy

Economy-overview: Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 33% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants.

@Malaysia:Economy

Economy-overview: After decades of high GDP growth, Malaysia's
economy-shaken by the ongoing regional financial crisis in 1997/98-is
forecast by the government to grow only 4%-5% in 1998; private
forecasts project the growth rate could be as low as 2%. The sharp
decline in local currency and stock markets forced Kuala Lumpur to
announce tough cost-cutting measures-on top of a contractionary
budget-to further reduce the current account deficit to 3% of GDP in
1998 from 5.5% in 1997. To achieve this goal, Kuala Lumpur will cut
government spending by 20% and continue to slash big-ticket imports
and defer large-scale infrastructure projects. Government austerity
and slower growth mean increased unemployment and higher interest
rates that will bite into corporate earnings.

@Maldives:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
about 18% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. About 350,000 tourists visited the islands
in 1997. Fishing is a second leading growth sector. The Maldivian
Government began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by
lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector.
Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor
role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of
cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods
must be imported. Industry, which consists mainly of garment
production, boat building, and handicrafts, accounts for about 15% of
GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and
possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is
three feet or less above sea level.

@Mali:Economy

Economy-overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful
implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program
that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign
investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50%
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994, has pushed up
economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold
mining operations in 1996 and the government anticipates that Mali
will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.

@Malta:Economy

Economy-overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has
no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade,
manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism; the
state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1996,
approximately 1 million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of
$12,900 places Malta in the range of the less affluent EU countries.
The island is divided politically over the question of joining the EU.

@Man, Isle of:Economy

Economy-overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key
sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives
to high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on
the island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP.
Banking and other services now contribute more than half to GDP. Trade
is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU
markets.

@Marshall Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of the
economy, constituting an important supplement to GDP. Agricultural
production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important
commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit.
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and
copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange
employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for
future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and
imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting economic
reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for reductions in
US Government grants-in FY95/96, the US Government provided grants of
$68 million, equal to roughly 70% of the country's GDP. More than 25%
of the government's FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt repayment. In
1996, efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27% reduction in the
government's work force and a 10% cut in the budget.

@Martinique:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism,
and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana
exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,
vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a
chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is
employed in the service sector and in administration.

@Mauritania:Economy

Economy-overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage of an economic
reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major
donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are poor because of the
heavy debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability
to climatic conditions.

@Mauritius:Economy

Economy-overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed
from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a middle income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial services, and
tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been of the
order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in
increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much
improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the
cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The
government's development strategy centers on industrialization (with a
view to modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification,
and tourism. Economic performance in 1991-97 continued strong with
solid growth and low unemployment.

Economy-overview: Economic activity is based primarily on the
agricultural sector, including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte
is not self-sufficient and must import a large portion of its food
requirements, mainly from France. The economy and future development
of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an
important supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle
to the development of tourism.

@Mexico:Economy

Economy-overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated
by the private sector. The number of state-owned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1998. The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural gas
distribution, and airports. The Mexican economy is in its third year
of recovery from the recession of 1995, which was touched off by a
financial crisis. After declining 6.2% in 1995, real GDP grew 5.1% in
1996 and 7.3% in 1997 and is expected to rise by 5% in 1998. A strong
export sector helped to cushion the economy's decline in 1995 and led
the recovery in 1996 and 1997. Private consumption spending in 1998
probably will rise by at least 4% on the strength of increased
employment and rising real wages, and the troubled banking sector is
likely to increase lending for the first time in three years. Despite
the spillover from the Asian crisis, the medium-term outlook for
Mexico remains positive, with government and private sector economists
projecting average annual growth of 4% to 5% through the year 2000.
Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it strives
to modernize its economy and raise living standards. Income
distribution is very unequal with the top 20% of income earners
accounting for 55% of income. The inefficient agricultural sector
employs 20% to 25% of the labor force but produces only 8% of GDP.
Trade with the United States and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA
was implemented in 1994. Mexico is pursuing additional trade
agreements with most countries in Latin America and with the European
Union to lessen its dependence on the United States, which accounts
for 80% of Mexico's total trade.

@Micronesia, Federated States of:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence
farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth
exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a
tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack
of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from
the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend
$1 billion in the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and a
poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term
growth.

@Moldova:Economy

Economy-overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland
but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends
heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and
tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress on an
ambitious economic reform agenda. As part of its reform efforts,
Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all prices,
stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed
steady land privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest
rates. The IMF has suspended payment on Moldova's Extended Fund
Facility since November 1997, due to concerns about the budget deficit
and money supply growth. In late December Parliament agreed to a lower
1998 budget deficit to address IMF and World Bank concerns.

Economy-overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast,
is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
climate. The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into
services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The
state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
haven both for individuals who have established residence and for
foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 55%
of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
banks, and the industrial sector. Living standards are high, roughly
comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

@Mongolia:Economy

Economy-overview: The government has embraced free-market economics,
freezing spending, easing price controls, liberalizing domestic and
international trade. Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population,
and wide expanses of unproductive land, however, have constrained
economic development. Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years, extensive
mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet
assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP, but disappeared
almost overnight in 1990-91. The mining and processing of coal,
copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
of industrial production. The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting
support from foreign donors, who pledged some $250 million in aid in
October 1997. Economic growth picked up in 1997 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of
copper and cashmere.

@Montserrat:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of this volcanic island is small and
open, with economic activity centered on tourism and related services.
Tourism accounts for roughly one-quarter of Montserrat's national
income. The island's main export is electronic components, which are
mainly shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,
carrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;
additionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the US
and Europe. Volcanic activity in mid-1997 led to a substantial
evacuation of the southern half of the island, including the capital,
Plymouth. Volcanic activity since July 1995 has resulted in the
departure of an estimated 8,000 people, mainly to Antigua and
Guadeloupe.

@Morocco:Economy

Economy-overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries-restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an
economic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF,
the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now
fully convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the
financial sector have been implemented; and state enterprises are
slowly being privatized. Drought conditions in 1997 depressed activity
in the key agricultural sector, holding down exports and contributing
to a 2.2% contraction in real GDP. Favorable rainfalls in the fall of
1997 have led to forecasts of robust, 8%-9% real GDP growth in 1998.
Servicing the external debt, preparing the economy for freer trade
with the European Union, improving education and living standards, and
finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term
challenges.

@Morocco:Transnational Issues

Disputes-international: claims and administers Western Sahara, but
sovereignty is unresolved and the UN is attempting to hold a
referendum on the issue; the UN-administered cease-fire has been in
effect since September 1991; Spain controls five places of sovereignty
(plazas de soberania) on and off the coast of Morocco-the coastal
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla which Morocco contests, as well as the
islands of Penon de Alhucemas, Penon de Velez de la Gomera, and Islas
Chafarinas

Illicit drugs: illicit producer of hashish; trafficking on the
increase for both domestic and international drug markets; shipments
of hashish mostly directed to Western Europe; transit point for
cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe

@Mozambique:Economy

Economy-overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992, Mozambique
had been devastated by civil war and was one of the poorest countries
on the globe. Prospects subsequently improved, and with its solid
economic performance in 1996-97, Mozambique has begun to exploit its
sizable agricultural, hydropower, and transportation resources.
Foreign assistance programs help supply the foreign exchange required
to support the budget and pay for imports of goods and services. The
restoration of electrical transmission lines to South Africa and the
completion of a new transmission line to Zimbabwe (permitting the
giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export large amounts of
electricity), proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline to South
Africa, and reform of transportation services will greatly improve
foreign exchange receipts. The Mozambique and South African
Governments are developing the Maputo corridor, linking the port of
Maputo with Witbank, South Africa. In the past few years, more than
700 state enterprises have been privatized, including the country's
largest commercial bank and a number of sizable manufacturing firms.
Other pending reform measures are the reform of tax collection and the
facilitation of private enterprise in the transportation, energy, and
telecommunications sectors.

@Namibia:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of GDP.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is three to six times
the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of
Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of the great
inequality of income distribution and the large amounts going to
foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to South Africa.

@Nauru:Economy

Economy-overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the
reserves of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000.
Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World, but incomes probably will drop sharply in the
future. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition. However,
dividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the
government has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance
fiscal deficits. In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal
problems, the government has called for a freeze on wages for two
years, a reduction of over-staffed public service departments, drastic
cutbacks in hiring new government staff, privatization of numerous
government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.

@Nepal:Economy

Economy-overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with more than half of its population living
below the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting
for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of
agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.
Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past two years.
Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural
resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
is growing by about 5% on average as compared with annual population
growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been moving forward
with economic reforms particularly those that encourage trade and
foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses and
registration requirements in order to simplify investment procedures.
The government has also been cutting expenditures by reducing
subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off civil
servants. More recently, however, political instability - five
different governments over the past few years-has hampered Kathmandu's
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms. Nepal
has considerable scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting
its potential in hydropower and tourism, areas where there has
recently been foreign investment interest. Prospects for foreign trade
or investment in other areas will remain poor, however, because of the
small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its
remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, and its susceptibility
to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding
more than 60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total
budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of
growth.

@Netherlands:Economy

Economy-overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based
on private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt,
however, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare
programs affecting most aspects of economic activity. Industrial
activity features food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking. The
highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. Indeed, the Netherlands ranks third
worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and France.
Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been
accompanied by sustained growth in output and employment. Growth in
1998 should be a brisk 3.5%. The Dutch will almost certainly qualify
for the first wave of countries entering the European Monetary Union
(EMU) in 1999.

@Netherlands Antilles:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, petroleum transshipment, and offshore
finance are the mainstays of this small economy, which is closely tied
to the outside world. The islands enjoy a high per capita income and a
well-developed infrastructure as compared with other countries in the
region. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with
Venezuela and the US being the major suppliers. Poor soils and
inadequate water supplies hamper the development of agriculture.

@New Caledonia:Economy

Economy-overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's known
nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered because of
depressed international demand for nickel, the principal source of
export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for
cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of imports. In addition
to nickel, financial support from France and tourism are key to the
health of the economy. The outlook for 1998 is clouded by the
spillover of financial problems in East Asia and by lower expected
prices for nickel.

@New Zealand:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent on a
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized, free
market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the technological
capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained inflationary
pressures. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and export demand
picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Growth
continued strong in 1995, but tailed off in 1996-97. Inflation remains
among the lowest in the industrial world. Per capita GDP has been
moving up to the levels of the big West European economies. However,
the Asian economic crisis may slow GDP growth in 1998.

@Nicaragua:Economy

Economy-overview: The Nicaraguan economy, devastated during the 1980s
by economic mismanagement and civil war, is beginning to rebound. In
1991 President CHAMORRO launched an ambitious economic stabilization
program that reduced inflation and obtained substantial economic aid
from abroad. Economic growth rose sharply in 1995-97, due to surges in
exports and efforts to enhance trade liberalization. The program,
however, hit some snags, and a 1994-97 IMF Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) signed by the CHAMORRO administration with
the Fund lapsed in September 1996 due to non-compliance. In 1997,
however, the IMF resumed negotiations for an ESAF with the ALEMAN
administration, and agreed to an ESAF in 1998. IMF approval of the
ESAF cleared the way for debt relief by the Paris Club later that year
and has opened the way for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative. Implementation of a 1997 property
accord-designed to resolve conflict over properties confiscated by the
Sandinistas in the 1980s-should also help inspire international
investor confidence. Strong growth is forecast for 1998, with
implementation of a 1997 free trade agreement with Mexico expected to
boost agricultural exports, although the industrial sector may come
under pressure from increased Mexican competition.

@Niger:Economy

Economy-overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export
since the 1970s. Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest regional
trade partner, have improved dramatically since the 50% devaluation of
the West African franc in January 1994; this devaluation boosted
exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's
small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral and
multilateral aid for operating expenses and public investment and is
strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment programs designed
by the IMF and the World Bank. The US terminated bilateral assistance
to Niger after the coup of 1996. Other donors have reduced their aid.

@Nigeria:Economy

Economy-overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be
hobbled by political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic
management. Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make
significant progress in diversifying the economy away from
overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides 30%
of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. The government's resistance to initiating greater
transparency and accountability in managing the country's multibillion
dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic growth and prevent an
agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief. The
largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with
rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of
food, now must import food. Agricultural production in 1996 suffered
from severe shortages of fertilizer, and production of fertilizer fell
even further in 1997.

@Niue:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand and remittances as Niue has no indigenous export product.
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall
made up by grants from New Zealand; the grants are used to pay wages
to public employees. Niue cut government expenditures in 1994-96 by
reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector
consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are
grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to
process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of
postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand. A small
tourist industry is developing.

@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $800 million to the US
in 1997 under duty and quota exemptions.

@Norway:Economy

Economy-overview: Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare
capitalism. The economy consists of a combination of free market
activity and government intervention. The government controls key
areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare
system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%
of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the
world. A small country with a high dependence on international trade,
Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed
goods, with an abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is
ranked among the major shipping nations. The country is richly endowed
with natural resources-petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and
minerals-and is highly dependent on its oil sector. Only Saudi Arabia
exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more than half its food
needs. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
November 1994. Economic growth in 1998 should be about the same as in
1997. Inflation probably will move up toward 3% because of tightness
in labor markets. Despite their high per capita income-outstripped
among major nations only by the US-and their generous welfare
benefits, Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century when
the oil and gas run out.

@Oman:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes
of the oil industry. Petroleum accounts for 75% of export earnings and
government revenues and for roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil
reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years'
production at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried
on at a subsistence level and the general population depends on
imported food. The year 1996 was marked by higher oil production and
prices. The government is encouraging private investment, both
domestic and foreign, as a prime force for further economic
development.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the
Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Map references: World

Area:
total: 165.384 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of
Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan,
Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other
tributary water bodies

Area-comparative: about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean
(followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic
Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the
total land area of the world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal-a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the
ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and East Asia
from May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Mariana Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
Antarctica; cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru,
when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds,
causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
the loss of their food source; ships subject to superstructure icing
in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
hazard from June to December

Environment-current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Environment-international agreements:
party to: none of the selected agreements
signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography-note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
the southwestern Pacific Ocean

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.

@Pakistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Pakistan continues to suffer through a damaging
foreign exchange crisis. The crisis stems from years of loose fiscal
policies that exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money
supply, and current account deficit to explode. In April 1997, Prime
Minister SHARIF introduced a stimulus package of tax cuts intended to
boost failing industrial output and spur export growth. At that time,
the IMF endorsed the program, paving the way for a $1.5 billion
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Although the economy showed
signs of improvement following the measures, SHARIF has refused to
implement the tough structural reforms necessary for sustained,
longer-term growth. As a consequence, at yearend 1997, industrial
production continued to flag, foreign exchange reserves continued to
teeter around $1 billion-only four weeks of imports-and borrowing to
support the budget deficit already exceeded the amount allocated for
the entire fiscal year. At the same time, the government must cope
with long-standing economic vulnerabilities-inadequate infrastructure,
low levels of literacy, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and tribal
violence.

@Panama:Economy

Economy-overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's
economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce,
and tourism. Since taking office in 1994, President PEREZ BALLADARES
has advanced an economic reform program designed to liberalize the
trade regime, attract foreign investment, privatize state-owned
enterprises, institute fiscal reform, and encourage job creation
through labor code reform. The government privatized its two remaining
ports along the Panama Canal in 1997 and approved the sale of the
railroad in early 1998. It also plans to sell other assets, including
the electric company. Panama joined the World Trade Organization
(WTrO) and approved a tariff reduction that will give the country the
lowest average tariff rates in Latin America. A banking reform law was
approved by the legislature in early 1998 and will take effect in
June. After two years of near stagnation, the reforms are beginning to
take root; GDP grew by 3.6% in 1997 and is expected to grow by more
than 5% in 1998. The most important sectors driving growth have been
the Panama Canal and the shipping and port activities. The Colon Free
Zone also rebounded from a slow year in 1996.

@Papua New Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
resources, but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain
and the high cost of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture
provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population.
Mineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of
export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid
under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995,
Port Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a
structural adjustment program, of which the first phase was
successfully completed in 1996. Droughts caused by the El Nino weather
pattern wreaked havoc on Papua New Guinea's coffee, cocoa, and coconut
production, the mainstays of the agricultural-based economy and major
sources of export earnings. The coffee crop was slashed by up to 50%
in 1997. Moreover, droughts could bite into growth in 1998.

@Paraguay:Economy

Economy-overview: Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector. The informal sector features both reexport of
imported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys, perfumes, cigarettes,
and office equipment) to neighboring countries as well as the
activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors.
The formal sector is largely oriented toward services. A large
percentage of the population derive their living from agricultural
activity, often on a subsistence basis. The formal economy has grown
an average of about 3% over the past five years. However, population
has increased at about the same rate over the same period, leaving per
capita income nearly stagnant. The WASMOSY government has continued to
pursue its economic reform agenda, albeit with limited success because
of in-fighting in the ruling party and resistance from the opposition.
Paraguay's ongoing integration into Mercosur (the Southern Cone Common
Market) offers potential for investment and growth.

(from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed
by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge
with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
central government and organizational and political difficulties, the
regions have yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993
constitution retains the regions but limits their authority; the 1993

@Peru:Economy

Economy-overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
market-oriented, with major privatizations completed since 1990 in the
mining, electricity, and telecommunications industries. In the 1980s,
the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output,
and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late
that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as
the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991
dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a
financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,
although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual
El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch, but the
economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped push growth to
7% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and 6.8% in 1995. Growth slowed to
about 2.8% in 1996 as the government adopted tight fiscal and monetary
policy to reduce the current account deficit and meet its IMF targets.
Growth then rebounded to 7.3% in 1997 even as inflation fell to its
lowest level in 23 years. Capital inflows surged to record levels in
early 1997 and have remained strong despite economic shocks stemming
from the Asian financial crisis and the El Nino weather events.

@Philippines:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the Philippine economy, primarily a mixture
of agriculture and light industry, continued its fifth year of
positive economic growth, led by expansion of exports and investment.
The government expects growth to slow to about 3% in 1998 due to
spillover effects of the financial crisis in East Asia. The government
has promised to continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines
match the pace of development in the newly industrialized countries of
East Asia. The strategy includes improving infrastructure, overhauling
the tax system to bolster government revenues, and moving toward
further deregulation and privatization of the economy.

@Poland:Economy

Economy-overview: Poland today stands out as one of the most
successful and open transition economies. The privatization of small
and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new
firms marked the rapid development of a private sector now responsible
for at least two-thirds of economic activity. In contrast to the
vibrant expansion of private non-farm activity, the large agriculture
component remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor,
inefficient small farms, and lack of investment. The government's
determination to enter the EU as soon as possible affects all aspects
of its economic policies. Improving Poland's worsening current account
deficit also is a priority. To date, the government has resisted
pressure for protectionist solutions and continues to support regional
free trade initiatives. The government export strategy emphasizes a
more aggressive export assistance program. Warsaw continues to hold
the budget deficit to less than 2% of GDP. Further progress on public
finance depends mainly on comprehensive reform of the social welfare
system and privatization of Poland's remaining state sector.
Restructuring and privatization of "sensitive sectors" (e.g., coal,
steel) has been delayed. Long-awaited privatizations in aviation,
energy, and telecommunications are scheduled for 1998.

@Portugal:Economy

Economy-overview: Portugal's short-term economic fundamentals remain
strong: 1997 was marked by a reduction in inflation, a rise in the GDP
growth rate, a reduction in the fiscal deficit, and a lowering of
interest rates. The Socialist government's primary economic goal is to
place Portugal in the initial group of countries adopting the single
European currency; Lisbon looks well positioned to be in the first
tranche of EMU countries. As for the long run, Portugal is increasing
its infrastructure spending, in anticipation of hosting the world's
International Exposition, which began in May 1998. Lisbon also is
working to modernize its capital plant and increase competitiveness in
hope of moving up closer to the EU average.

@Puerto Rico:Economy

Economy-overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in
the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has surpassed
agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.
Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US
firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum
wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 4
million tourists in 1993. The construction sector has been a key
factor in recent economic growth.

@Qatar:Economy

Economy-overview: Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for
more than 30% of GDP, roughly 70% of export earnings, and 66% of
government revenues. Proved oil reserves of 3.7 billion barrels should
ensure continued output at current levels for 23 years. Oil has given
Qatar a per capita GDP comparable to the leading West European
industrial countries. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 7
trillion cubic meters, more than 5% of the world total, third largest
in the world. Production and export of natural gas are becoming
increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the development of
off-shore petroleum and the diversification of the economy.

@Reunion:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture. Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a
century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The
government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to
relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the
labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The
white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
segments of the population, often approaching European standards,
whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical
of the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe
rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic
tensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France.

@Romania:Economy

Economy-overview: Romania, one of the poorer countries in the region,
is continuing its difficult transition to a market-based economy.
After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1989-91, Romania was left
with an obsolete industrial base and a pattern of industrial capacity
wholly unsuited to its needs. For the next few years the country
lagged behind most of its neighbors in the pace of restructuring. Then
in February 1997, Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform program. The domestic foreign
exchange market was freed, and controls on current-account
convertibility were removed in October. Restructuring programs include
liquidating large energy-intensive industries, and agricultural and
financial sector reform. The private sector share of GDP rose to an
estimated 58% in 1997, however, this total includes firms with
government-held minority stakes. Although progress has been made in
privatizing small- and medium-sized firms, delays in structural
reforms-including the postponement of sales of large state-owned
enterprises - threaten plans to revive GDP growth. In 1998, GDP will
likely be unchanged; and inflation is projected to fall to 45% from
151% in 1997.

@Russia:Economy

Economy-overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural
resources, a well-educated population, and a diverse, but declining,
industrial base, continues to experience formidable difficulties in
moving from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market
economy. After seven consecutive years of contraction 1990-96 in which
GDP fell by one-third, GDP grew by 0.4% in 1997, according to official
statistics. Moscow continued to make strides in its battle against
inflation, which fell to 11%, half the 1996 rate. The central
government made good on most back wages owed public-sector
employees-including the military-although the stock of wage arrears to
employees of private enterprises remained large. Privatization
revenues increased significantly, largely on the strength of a few
high-profile tenders, such as that of telecommunications giant
Svyazinvest. On the downside, Moscow continued to struggle with a
severe fiscal imbalance. Lagging tax collections led the government to
adopt a revised budget in spring 1997 that cut spending by about 20%
despite protests from the legislature. Russia's traditional trade
surplus continued to contract-largely because of soft international
commodity prices-and Moscow's WTrO accession made only halting
progress. Although President YEL'TSIN brought in a new economic team
early in 1997, key structural reform initiatives continue to move
slowly. A revised tax code remains stuck in the Duma, while little
progress is being made on agricultural land reform. Small business
development has lagged. Prospects for a return to robust growth have
been set back by the spillover from Asia's financial turmoil, which
hit Russia hard during the last quarter of 1997. Moscow at first tried
to both support the ruble and keep interest rates down, but this
policy proved unsustainable, and in early December 1997 the Central
Bank let interest rates rise sharply. As the year ended, Russian
authorities were attempting to put the best face on the financial
situation, while at the same time scaling back their previous
optimistic growth projections for 1998 to 1%-2%. Because of Russia's
severe macroeconomic constraints, resources allocated to the military
sector have declined sharply since the implosion of the USSR in
December 1991.

@Rwanda:Economy

Economy-overview: Rwanda is a poor African nation that has suffered
bitterly from ethnic-based civil war. The agricultural sector
dominates the economy; coffee and tea normally make up 80%-90% of
exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
deforestation and soil erosion continue to reduce the production
potential. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
agricultural products. A structural adjustment program with the World
Bank began in October 1990. Civil war in 1990 devastated wide areas,
especially in the north, and displaced hundreds of thousands of
people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the
fighting, but resumption of large-scale violence and genocide in April
1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500,000 lives in
that year alone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects.
In 1994-96, peace was restored throughout much of the country. In
1996-97 most of the refugees who fled the war returned to Rwanda.
Sketchy data suggest that GDP dropped 50% in 1994 and came back
partially, by 25%, in 1995. Plentiful rains helped agriculture in
1996, and outside aid continued to support this desperately poor
economy. The economy continues to face significant challenges in
rehabilitating infrastructure, agriculture, health care facilities,
and capital plant. Recovery of domestic production will proceed
slowly.

@Saint Kitts and Nevis:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy has traditionally depended on the
growing and processing of sugarcane; decreasing world prices have hurt
the industry in recent years. Tourism, export-oriented manufacturing,
and offshore banking activity have assumed larger roles. Most food is
imported. The government has undertaken a program designed to
revitalize the faltering sugar sector. It is also working to improve
revenue collection in order to better fund social programs. In 1997
some leaders in Nevis were urging separation from Saint Kitts on the
basis that Nevis was paying far more in taxes than it was receiving in
government services.

@Saint Lucia:Economy

Economy-overview: Though foreign investment in manufacturing and
information processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucia's
industrial base, the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy
dependence on banana production, which is subject to periodic droughts
and tropical storms. Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm
Iris in mid-1995 caused the loss of 20% of the year's banana crop.
Increased competition from Latin American bananas will probably
further reduce market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to
diversify its economy in coming years, e.g., by further expanding
tourism, manufacturing, and construction.

@Saint Pierre and Miquelon:Economy

Economy-overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off
the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however,
because the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped
steadily over the years. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the
islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a
longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents
only 25% of what France had sought. The islands are heavily subsidized
by France. Imports come primarily from Canada and France.

@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the
most important sector of this lower middle income economy. The
services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also
important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at
introducing new industries, and high unemployment rates of 35%-40%
continue. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the
biggest obstacle to the islands' development; tropical storms wiped
out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995. The tourism
sector has considerable potential for development over the next
decade.

@Samoa:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Samoa has traditionally been
dependent on development aid, private family remittances from
overseas, and agricultural exports. The country is vulnerable to
devastating storms. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force,
and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil,
and copra. Outside of a large automotive wire harness factory, the
manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. Tourism
is an expanding sector; more than 70,0000 tourists visited the islands
in 1996. The 1998 Samoan budget calls for deregulation of the
financial sector, development of more financial investments, and
forecasts 3% to 4% growth.

@Sao Tome and Principe:Economy

Economy-overview: This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence over 20 years ago.
However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of
drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export
has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao Tome has to
import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a
significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to
service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid
and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential exists for development
of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand
facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to
reduce price controls and subsidies, but economic growth has remained
sluggish. Sao Tome is also optimistic that significant petroleum
discoveries are forthcoming in its territorial waters in the oil-rich
waters of the Gulf of Guinea.

@Saudi Arabia:Economy

Economy-overview: This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong
government controls over major economic activities. About 35% of GDP
comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties
with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for
roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and 90% of export
earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of
petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
activity. Roughly 4 million foreign workers play an important role in
the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and service sectors. Helped
by production above its OPEC quota, Saudi Arabia continued to bring
its finances closer into balance in 1997, recording a $1.6 billion
budget deficit and a $200 million current account surplus. For 1998,
the country looks to its policies of maintaining moderate fiscal
reforms, restraining public spending, and encouraging nonoil exports.
Shortages of water and rapid population growth will constrain
government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural
products.

@Senegal:Economy

Economy-overview: In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and
ambitious economic reform program with the support of the
international donor community. This reform began with a 50%
devaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which is linked at a
fixed rate to the French franc. Government price controls and
subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy
contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks
to the reform program, with real growth in GDP of 5.6% in 1996 and
4.7% in 1997. Annual inflation has been pushed below 3% and the fiscal
deficit has been cut to less than 1.5% of GDP. Investment has been
steadily rising from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in 1997. As a
member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA),
Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified
external tariff. Senegal also realized full Internet connectivity in
1996, creating a miniboom in information technology-based services.
Private activity now accounts for 82% of GDP. On the negative side,
Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic unemployment,
juvenile delinquency, and drug addiction.

@Serbia and Montenegro:Economy

Economy-overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in
1991 has been followed by highly destructive warfare, the
destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup of important
interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by
half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had
depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and
manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and
levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of
many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants
lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is
the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform.
Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency unit in
June 1993; prices have been relatively stable since 1995. Reliable
statistics continue to be hard to come by, and the GDP estimate is
extremely rough. The economic boom anticipated by the government after
the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has failed to
materialize. Until the government cooperates on such matters as human
rights and war criminals, it will lack full support from international
financial institutions.

@Seychelles:Economy

Economy-overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the tourist sector,
which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70%
of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing, which accounted for
70% of GDP in 1996-97. In recent years the government has encouraged
foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At
the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on
tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and
small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was
illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war.
Although the industry has rebounded, the government recognizes the
continuing need for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff
international competition.

Introduction

Current issues: On 25 May 1997, the democratically-elected government
of President Ahmad Tejan KABBAH was overthrown by disgruntled army
personnel under the command of Major Johnny Paul KOROMA; President
KABBAH fled to exile in Guinea. The Economic Community of West African
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) forces, led by a strong
Nigerian contingent, undertook the suppression of the rebellion. They
were initially unsuccessful, but, by October 1997, they forced the
rebels to agree to a cease-fire and to a plan to return the government
to democratic control by 22 April 1998. However, the agreed
demobilization of the combatants was not carried out by the rebel
junta. On 5 February 1998, hostilities broke out in the outskirts of
Freetown and ECOMOG mounted a major offensive, completely routing the
rebels. President KABBAH returned to office on 10 March to face the
task of restoring order to a demoralized population and a disorganized
and severely damaged economy.

@Sierra Leone:Economy

Economy-overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural,
and fishery resources. However, the economic and social infrastructure
is not well developed, and serious social disorders continue to hamper
economic development. The seizure of power by the new Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in May 1997 led to UN sanctions and a
sharp drop in GDP. About two-thirds of the working-age population
engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of
the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the
domestic market. Bauxite and rutile mines have been shut down by civil
strife. The major source of hard currency is found in the mining of
diamonds, the large majority of which are smuggled out of the country.

@Singapore:Economy

Economy-overview: Singapore has an open economy with strong service
and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
derived from its entrepot history. Extraordinarily strong fundamentals
allowed Singapore to weather the effects of the Asian financial crisis
better than its neighbors, but the crisis did pull GDP growth down to
approximately 6% in 1997. Projections for 1998 GDP growth are in the
4.5% to 6.5% range. Rising labor costs and appreciation of the
Singapore dollar against its neighbors' currencies continue to be a
threat to Singapore's competitiveness. The government's strategy to
address this problem includes increasing productivity, improving
infrastructure, and encouraging higher value-added industries. In
applied technology, per capita output, investment, and labor
discipline, Singapore has key attributes of a developed country.

@Slovakia:Economy

Economy-overview: Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic on 1
January 1993, Slovakia has continued the difficult transformation from
a centrally controlled economy to a modern market-oriented economy.
Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 1994-96, but
privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export
performance boosted GDP growth to 4.9% in 1994 after a four-year
decline. GDP then rose by 6.8% in 1995, 7% in 1996, and 5.9% in 1997,
rates among the highest in Central and Eastern Europe. Inflation
dropped from 26% in 1993 to 6% annually in 1996-97, the lowest rate in
the region. Private activity now makes up more than two-thirds of GDP.
Although Slovak economic performance continues to be impressive, many
warning signs of possible danger ahead have been raised. Aggregate
demand has surged in the form of increased personal and government
consumption. At the same time that the budget deficit is growing, the
money supply has been rapidly increasing, which could apply upward
pressure on inflation. The trade and current account deficits both are
mounting as imports soar and exports sag. Perhaps most troubling,
Slovakia continues to have difficulty attracting foreign investment
because of perceived political problems and halting progress on
restructuring and privatization. Continuing economic recovery in
western Europe should boost exports and production, but Slovakia's
position with foreign creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in
1998 if progress on privatization and restructuring stalls and if
domestic political problems continue to tarnish its international
image.

@Slovenia:Economy

Economy-overview: Today, Slovenia exhibits the highest per capita GDP
of all the transition economies of the region, fairly moderate
inflation, and a comfortable level of international reserves. However,
GDP has posted slower growth since reaching a zenith of 5.5% in 1994.
Growth declined to 3.5% in 1995 and 3.2% in 1996 and in 1997. Exports
in 1997 benefited from economic recovery abroad-especially of
Slovenia's main trading partners of the EU, which take 70% of Slovene
exports. This export-led trend is predicted to continue, with an
expected GDP growth rate of 3.8% for 1998. Slovenia received an
invitation in 1997 to begin accession negotiations with the EU-a
further reflection of Slovenia's sound economic footing. Slovenia must
press on with privatization, enterprise restructuring, institution
reform, and liberalization of financial markets, thereby creating
conditions conducive to foreign investment, and maintaining a stable
tolar.

@Solomon Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The bulk of the population depend on subsistence
agriculture, fishing, and forestry for at least part of their
livelihood. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be
imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such
as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. In recent years the government has
poorly managed the country's finances. The new prime minister has
vowed to cut expenditures and to promote the private sector to boost
economic growth.

@Somalia:People

Population: 6,841,695 (July 1998 est.)
note: this estimate was derived from an official census taken in 1987
by the Somali Government with the cooperation of the UN and the US
Bureau of the Census; population estimates are updated year by year
between census years by factoring growth rates into them and by taking
account of refugee movements and of losses due to famine; lower
estimates of Somalia's population in mid-1996 (on the order of 6.0
million to 6.5 million) have been made by aid and relief agencies,
based on the number of persons being fed; population counting in
Somalia is complicated by the large numbers of nomads and by refugee
movements in response to famine and clan warfare

Government-note: While chaos and clan fighting continue in most of
Somalia, some orderly government has been established in the northern
part. In May 1991, the elders of clans in former British Somaliland
established the independent Republic of Somaliland, which, although
not recognized by any government, maintains a stable existence, aided
by the overwhelming dominance of the ruling clan and the economic
infrastructure left behind by British, Russian and American military
assistance programs. The economy has been growing and in February 1996
the EU agreed to finance the reconstruction of the port of Berbera;
since then, other aid projects have been assumed by the EU and by a
non-governmental Italian organization.

@Somalia:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed
countries, Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy
has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most
important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and
about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-nomads, who are
dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion
of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and
employs about 20% of the work force. After livestock, bananas are the
principal export; sugar, sorghum, corn, and fish are products for the
domestic market. The small industrial sector, based on the processing
of agricultural products, accounts for less than 10% of GDP; most
facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife. Moreover,
ongoing civil disturbances in Mogadishu and outlying areas are
interfering with any substantial economic advance.

@South Africa:Economy

Economy-overview: South Africa is a middle-income, developing country
with an abundant supply of resources, well developed financial, legal,
communications, energy, and transport sectors, a stock exchange that
ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a modern infrastructure
supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers
throughout the region. Growth has been positive since the historic
election of President Nelson MANDELA in the country's first
multi-racial elections in 1994, but not strong enough to cut into the
substantial unemployment. Daunting economic problems remain from the
apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and economic
empowerment among the blacks. Other problems are crime and corruption.
The new South African Government demonstrated its commitment to open
markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate with the
release of its macroeconomic strategy in June 1996. Called "Growth,
Employment and Redistribution," this policy framework includes the
introduction of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in
labor-intensive projects, expansion of basic infrastructure services,
the restructuring and partial privatization of state assets, continued
reduction of tariffs and subsidies to promote economic efficiency,
improved services to the disadvantaged, and integration into the
global economy.

@Spain:Economy

Economy-overview: Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP that
on a per capita basis is three-fourths that of the four leading West
European economies. Its center-right government has staked much on
gaining admission to the first group of countries to implement the
European single currency and, based on economic indicators, Madrid
appears poised to be in EMU from the outset. The deficit-to-GDP ratio
is 2.3%, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be around 68%, and
inflation is approximately 2%. Moreover, the AZNAR administration has
continued to advocate liberalization, privatization, and deregulation
of the economy, and has introduced some tax reforms to that end.
Unemployment, nonetheless, remains the highest in the EU at 21%. The
government, for political reasons, has made only limited progress in
changing labor laws or reforming pension schemes, which are key to the
sustainability of both Spain's internal economic advances and its
competitiveness in a single currency area.

@Sri Lanka:Economy

Economy-overview: At independence in 1948, plantations growing tea,
rubber, or coconuts and paddies growing rice for subsistence dominated
Sri Lanka's economy, and, as late as 1970, plantation crops accounted
for 93% of exports. In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic
policies and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented
policies and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic
industries now are food processing, textiles and apparel, food and
beverages, telecommunications, and insurance and banking. By 1996
plantation crops made up only 20% of exports, while textiles and
garments accounted for 63%. GDP grew at an annual average rate of 5.5%
throughout the 1990s until a drought and a deteriorating security
situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in
second half 1996, however, and continued to perform well in 1997 with
growth of 6%. Sustained economic growth, coupled with population
growth of only 1.1%, has pushed Sri Lanka from the ranks of the
poorest countries in the world up to the threshold of the middle
income countries. For the next round of reforms, the central bank of
Sri Lanka recommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in
nonplantation agriculture, dismantle the government's monopoly on
wheat imports, and promote more competition in the financial sector. A
continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the
Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, which has cost 50,000 lives in the
past 14 years.

@Sudan:Economy

Economy-overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political
instability, adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances
from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. The private
sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most
private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%
of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
largely to declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita income at
low levels. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause
difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual
step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of
arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in
1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid
expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the
Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has
partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the
civil war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit
growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1997.
Hyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of most. In
1997, a top priority was to develop potentially lucrative oilfields in
south-central Sudan; the government was seeking foreign partners to
exploit the oil sector.

@Suriname:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry,
which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.
Following a dismal year in 1994-which saw the value of the Surinamese
guilder plummet by about 70%, inflation rise to more than 600%, and
national output fall for the fifth consecutive year-nearly all
economic indicators improved in 1995-97. The VENETIAAN government
unified the exchange rate as part of its structural adjustment program
(SAP). After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the WIJDENBOSCH
government ended the SAP claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements
of society. Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government
failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the
allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese
government relations with Holland deteriorated. Suriname's economic
prospects for the medium term will depend on renewed commitment to
financially responsible monetary and fiscal policies.

Economy-overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on
Svalbard. The treaty of 9 February 1920 gives the 41 signatories equal
rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation.
Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the
past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The
settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian
state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian
population on the island, runs many of the local services, and
provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping
of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

@Swaziland:Economy

Economy-overview: In this small landlocked economy, subsistence
agriculture occupies more than 60% of the population. Manufacturing
features a number of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined in
importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted
by 1978, and health concerns have cut world demand for asbestos.
Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar and wood pulp are the main
earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a
short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South
Africa from which it receives nearly 90% of its imports and to which
it sends more than half of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers
in South African mines supplement domestically earned income by as
much as 20%. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for
foreign investment. Overgrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist
as problems for the future.

@Sweden:Economy

Economy-overview: Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole
twentieth century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living
under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and
external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account
for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only
2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however, this
extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary
difficulties, inflation, high unemployment, and a gradual loss of
competitiveness in international markets. To curb the budget deficit
and bolster confidence in the economy, the government adopted an
adjustment program in November 1994 that aims to eliminate the
government budget deficit and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio.
Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU,
which it joined at the start of 1995. Sweden has decided not to join
the EMU (European Monetary Union). Annual GDP growth should edge up to
2.5% in 1998-99.

@Switzerland:Economy

Economy-overview: Switzerland, a fundamentally prosperous and stable
modern economy with a per capita GDP roughly 10% above that of the big
West European economies, is experiencing continued economic
difficulties. GDP growth was a minus 0.2% in 1996 and a weak plus 0.4%
in 1997. Weak domestic consumer demand is partly at fault; stagnating
real disposable income combines with a reluctance to reduce saving
rates in the face of an uncertain employment outlook. Switzerland's
leading sectors, including financial services, biotechnology,
pharmaceuticals, and special-purpose machines, therefore are more
reliant on export markets. Exports should lead an upturn in Swiss
economic performance in 1998-99, provided the franc does not
appreciate substantially as a result of Swiss monetary policy or
instability in the run up to EMU.

@Syria:Economy

Economy-overview: Syria's predominantly statist economy is on a shaky
footing because of Damascus's failure to implement extensive economic
reform. The dominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped, with
roughly 80% of agricultural land still dependent on rain-fed sources.
Although Syria has sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at
normal levels of precipitation, the great distance between major water
supplies and population centers poses serious distribution problems.
The water problem is exacerbated by rapid population growth,
industrial expansion, and increased water pollution. Private
investment is critical to the modernization of the agricultural,
energy, and export sectors. Oil production is leveling off, and the
efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate international markets have
fallen short. Syria's inadequate infrastructure, outmoded
technological base, and weak educational system make it vulnerable to
future shocks and hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and
Israel.

@Taiwan:Economy

Economy-overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with
gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign trade by
government authorities and partial government ownership of some large
banks and industrial firms. Spillover from the Asian financial crisis
hit Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 1997, wreaking havoc on the stock
and currency markets. While the economy remains sound (the government
forecasts 6% GDP growth for 1998), the New Taiwan Dollar depreciated
20% in 1997. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8.5% a year during
the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and has
provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment
are low. Agriculture contributes only 3% to GDP, down from 35% in
1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being moved
off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of
labor markets has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and
illegal.

1997, but implementation is progressing slowly. Russian-led
peacekeeping troops are deployed throughout the country, and
Russian-commanded border guards are stationed along the
Tajikistani-Afghan border.

@Tajikistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Tajikistan has the lowest per capita GDP among the
former Soviet republics. Agriculture dominates the economy, with
cotton the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited
in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is
limited to a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small
obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The
Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by four years of civil
conflict and by the loss of subsidies from Moscow and of markets for
its products. Tajikistan thus depends on aid from Russia and
Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian assistance for much of
its basic subsistence needs. Even if the peace agreement of June 1997
is honored, the country faces major problems in integrating refugees
and former combatants into the economy. Moreover, constant political
turmoil and the continued dominance by former communist officials have
impeded the introduction of meaningful economic reforms.

@Tanzania:Economy

Economy-overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the
world. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts
for 57% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
crops to only 4% of the land area. Industry accounts for 17% of GDP
and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986
has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided
funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
Growth in 1991-97 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Natural gas
exploration in the Rufiji Delta looks promising and production could
start by 2002. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private
sector growth and investment.

@Thailand:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997/98, the Thai economy is in a deep recession
as a result of the severe financial problems facing many Thai firms,
particularly banks and finance companies. In the early 1990s, Thailand
liberalized financial inflows; banks and other firms borrowed in
dollars and did not hedge their positions because there was no
perceived exchange rate risk. These funds financed a property boom
that began to taper off in the mid-1990s. In addition, export growth -
previously a key driver of the Thai economy-collapsed in 1996,
resulting in growing doubts that the Bank of Thailand could maintain
the baht's peg to the dollar. The Bank mounted an expensive defense of
the exchange rate that nearly depleted foreign exchange reserves, then
decided to float the exchange rate, triggering a sharp increase in
foreign liabilities that cash-strapped Thai firms were already having
trouble repaying. In August 1997, the government headed by Prime
Minister CHAWALIT signed an agreement with the IMF for access to a $14
billion facility to supplement foreign exchange reserves and restore
financial market stability. CHAWALIT resigned in November 1997,
however, under pressure for lacking a coherent approach to managing
the IMF program and the financial crisis. Democratic Party leader
CHUAN Likphai formed a seven-party coalition government and closely
adhered to the IMF program, tentatively reestablishing financial
stability by February 1998. An economic turnaround requires
rescheduling the large short-term foreign liabilities of Thai firms,
restoring high rates of export growth to finance foreign liabilities,
and extensively recapitalizing the banking system.

@Togo:Economy

Economy-overview: This small sub-Saharan economy is heavily dependent
on both commercial and subsistence agriculture, which provides
employment for more than 60% of the labor force. Cocoa, coffee, and
cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is
self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal, with
occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector,
phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it
has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased
foreign competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade
center. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World
Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage
foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has
stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes
throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the reform program, shrunk
the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity. The 12 January
1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus
to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by
the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. The
1998 presidential elections provide an important opportunity for
Togo's evolving political system to demonstrate that the country can
participate in a peaceful and effective manner with World Bank and IMF
programs. Progress depends on continuing privatization, increased
transparency in government accounting to accommodate increased social
service outlays, and possible downsizing of the military, on which the
regime has depended to stay in place.

@Tonga:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which contributes
32% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are the main
crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of total exports.
The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New
Zealand. The industrial sector accounts for only 10% of GDP. Tourism
is the primary source of hard currency earnings; the country also
remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset
its trade deficit. The economy grew at a declining rate in 1993-96.
The government has been turning its attention to further development
of the private sector and the reduction of the budget deficit.

@Trinidad and Tobago:Economy

Economy-overview: Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an
excellent investment site for international businesses. Successful
economic reforms were implemented in 1995, and foreign investment and
trade are flourishing. Unemployment - a main cause of the country's
socio-economic problems-is high, but has decreased to its lowest point
in five years. The country enjoys a healthy trade surplus, yet its
heavy dependence on oil and petrochemical prices makes its trade
balance vulnerable to sudden shifts. Tourism is a major foreign
exchange earner, with 260,000 arrivals in 1995, 80% from Europe.

@Tunisia:Economy

Economy-overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important
agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors.
Governmental control of economic affairs has gradually lessened over
the past decade with increasing privatization of trade and commerce,
simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt.
Real growth averaged 4.6% in 1992-96 and reached 5.6% in 1997, down
from 6.9% in 1996, which benefited from a record cereal crop.
Inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and increased trade
have been key elements in this solid record. Tunisia's association
agreement with the European Union entered into force on 1 March 1998,
the first such accord between the EU and Mediterranean countries to be
activated. Under the agreement Tunisia will gradually remove barriers
to trade with the EU over the next decade. Further privatization, the
attraction of increased foreign investment, and improvements in
government efficiency are among the challenges for the future.

@Turkey:Economy

Economy-overview: Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern
industry and commerce along with traditional village agriculture and
crafts. It has a strong and rapidly growing private sector, yet the
state still plays a major role in basic industry, banking, transport,
and communication. Its most important industry-and the largest source
of exports-is textiles and clothing, which is almost entirely in
private hands. The current economic situation is marked by strong
growth coupled with serious imbalances. Real GDP expanded by about 7%
in 1997 but inflation rose to 99% at yearend, and the public sector
fiscal deficit probably remained near 10% of GDP. To some extent,
Ankara is caught in a vicious fiscal circle because about half of all
central government revenue is going to pay interest on the national
debt. The government that took office in July 1997-headed by Prime
Minister YILMAZ's Motherland Party-enacted a 1998 budget that includes
substantial tax increases and cuts in non-interest spending but these
gains will be offset by a jump in interest payments. The government
also is planning to overhaul the social welfare and tax systems and to
speed up privatization, although these reforms will face tough
political opposition. Ankara is trying to increase trade with other
countries in the region but most of Turkey's trade is still with OECD
countries. Despite the implementation in January 1996 of customs union
with the EU, foreign direct investment in the country remains
low-about $0.5 billion annually-perhaps because potential investors
are concerned about high inflation and the unsettled political
situation. Economic growth will slow in 1998 to perhaps 4%, and
inflation should decline, although the government's 50% target appears
overoptimistic. The current account deficit probably will remain
small-1% to 1.5% of GDP - when Turkey's unrecorded "suitcase" exports
are included.

@Turkmenistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic
cattle raising, intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas
and oil resources. One-half of its irrigated land is planted in
cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It also
possesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and
substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had
experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states
because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and
gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's
refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting
debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the
budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The economy
bottomed out in 1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore, with
an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally based
social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to
economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its
inefficient economy. In 1996, the government set in place a
stabilization program aimed at a unified and market-based exchange
rate, allocation of government credits by auction, and strict limits
on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited. Turkmenistan
is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and
Turkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize.

Natural hazards: severe tropical storms are usually rare, but, in
1997, there were three cyclones

Environment-current issues: since there are no streams or rivers and
groundwater is not potable, all water needs must be met by catchment
systems with storage facilities; beachhead erosion because of the use
of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest
undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the spread of
the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is very concerned about global
increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea
levels, which threaten the country's underground water table

@Tuvalu:Economy

Economy-overview: Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered
group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known
mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are
the primary economic activities. The islands are too small and too
remote for development of a large-scale tourist industry. Government
revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate
mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as
phosphate resources decline, which will present additional problems
for Tuvalu's already stretched economy. Substantial income is received
annually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by
Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea.
In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government
is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some
government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%. Low-lying Tuvalu
is particularly vulnerable to any future global warming.

@Uganda:Economy

Economy-overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including
fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of
copper and cobalt. Agriculture is the most important sector of the
economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major
export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986,
the government-with the support of foreign countries and international
agencies-has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by
undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops,
increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service
wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation
and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-97, the economy
turned in a solid performance based on: continued investment in the
rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production
and exports, reduced inflation, gradually improved domestic security,
and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.

@Ukraine:Economy

Economy-overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and
away the most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic.
Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of
meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to
industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR.
Ukraine depends on imports of energy, especially natural gas. Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian
Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for
privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the
government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to
some backtracking. Output in 1992-97 fell to less than half the 1991
level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA
has pushed economic reforms, maintained financial discipline, and
tried to remove almost all remaining controls over prices and foreign
trade. Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda is encountering
considerable resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and
industrial interests; and an environment of corruption continues to
discourage foreign investors. One signal achievement has been the
reduction of the inflation rate to 10% by yearend 1997. If KUCHMA
succeeds in implementing aggressive market reforms during 1998, the
economy should reverse its downward trend, with real growth occurring
by late 1998 and into 1999.

@United Arab Emirates:Economy

Economy-overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's
highest per capita incomes and with a sizable annual trade surplus.
Its wealth is based on oil and gas output (about 33% of GDP), and the
fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those
commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound
transformation from an impoverished region of small desert
principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At
present levels of production, oil and gas reserves should last for
over 100 years. The UAE Government is encouraging increased
privatization within the economy, and industrial development is
expected to pick up in 1997-98.

Tunb (called Tunb as Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e
Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in
Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); claims
island in the Persian Gulf jointly administered with Iran (called Abu
Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)-over
which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since 1992,
including access restrictions and a military build-up on the island;
the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the region in
protesting these Iranian actions

union of Great Britain and Ireland was implemented in 1801 adopting
the name the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; the
Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 formalized a partition of Ireland; six
northern Irish counties remained part of the United Kingdom as
Northern Ireland and the current name of the country, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was adopted in 1927

@United Kingdom:Economy

Economy-overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers
and financial centers, and its essentially capitalistic economy ranks
among the four largest in Western Europe. Over the past two decades
the government has greatly reduced public ownership and contained the
growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly
mechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60%
of food needs with only about 1% of the labor force. The UK has large
coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production
accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial
nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business
services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 18% of
the work force. Exports and manufacturing output have been the primary
engines of growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is a
moderate 3.1%. A major economic policy question for the UK in the late
1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and
economic integration of Europe.

@United States:Economy

Economy-overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and
technologically advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP
of $30,200, the largest among major industrial nations. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services
predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy
considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus
workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher
barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to
entry of foreign firms in US markets. In all economic sectors, US
firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military
equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end of
World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the bottom
lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at
the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance
coverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-97 witnessed moderate
gains in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment
below 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower
economic groups. The outlook for 1998 is for continued moderate
growth, low inflation, and about the same level of unemployment. Two
shadows for 1998 are the severe financial crises in East Asia and the
exuberant level of stock prices in relation to corporate earnings.

@Uruguay:Economy

Economy-overview: Uruguay's small economy benefits from a favorable
climate for agriculture and substantial hydropower potential. Economic
development has been restrained in recent years by high-though
declining-inflation and extensive government regulation. The
SANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and fiscal policies are
aimed at continuing to reduce inflation; other priorities include
extensive reform of the social security system and increased
investment in education. Economic performance remains sensitive to
conditions in Argentina and Brazil, largely because more than half of
Uruguay's trade is conducted with its partners in Mercosur (the
Southern Cone Common Market).

@Uzbekistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10%
consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was one
of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60% of
its population living in densely populated rural communities.
Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major
producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in
December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government
began to reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter monetary policies,
expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role of the state in
the economy, and improving the environment for foreign investors.
Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating influence in the
economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring about much-needed
structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's $185 million
standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental steps that
made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.

@Vanuatu:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with
46,000 visitors in 1996, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral
deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits.
A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues
come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by
dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to
natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between
constituent islands.

@Venezuela:Economy

Economy-overview: The petroleum sector dominates the economy,
accounting for 27% of GDP, 78% of export earnings, and more than half
of government operating revenues. It is likely to become even more
important as the state petroleum company plans to double its
production over the next 10 years. Realizing the failure of
interventionist policies, the CALDERA administration embarked on a
comprehensive economic reform program, which included negotiation of a
stand-by agreement with the IMF in 1996, elimination of price and
exchange controls, and revitalization of Venezuela's stalled
privatization program. The influx of foreign capital, and the currency
depreciation that followed exchange liberalization, led to 103%
inflation in 1996, the highest in Venezuelan history. The government
stepped in toward the end of 1996, propping up the Bolivar by using a
stable nominal exchange rate as a restraint on inflation-which fell in
1997 to 38%. The macroeconomic adjustments, bolstered by strong oil
prices, resulted in strong growth in 1997. However, the East Asian
financial crisis and the decline of international oil prices toward
the end of 1997 brought pressure on the currency, which Caracas was
able to stave off. Caracas readjusted its exchange rate bands and
began to allow quicker depreciation of the Bolivar; the government
also tightened monetary policy. Concerned over potential revenue
shortfalls from soft oil prices for the 1998 budget, Caracas has
implemented budget cuts to compensate for previously optimistic oil
revenue estimates. The government also has pushed ahead with sale of
the state-owned steel company and the strategic aluminum sector,
thereby reassuring domestic and international investors of Venezuela's
commitment to reform. The monetary and fiscal measures have been well
received by the international financial community. As a result,
financial analysts believe the economy will still grow at a healthy
pace in 1998, though they have lowered their initial projections for
GDP growth due to the soft oil market.

@Vietnam:Economy

Economy-overview: Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of financial
support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally
planned economy. Substantial progress has been achieved over the past
10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point.
Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1997 with industrial
output rising by 12% and real GDP expanding by 8.5%. These positive
numbers, however, masked some major difficulties that are emerging in
economic performance. Many domestic industries, including coal,
cement, steel, and paper, reported large stockpiles of inventory and
tough competition from more efficient foreign producers, giving
Vietnam a trade deficit of $3.3 billion in 1997. While disbursements
of aid and foreign direct investment have risen, they are not large
enough to finance the rapid increase in imports; and it is widely
believed that Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits to bridge
the gap-a risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange
crunch. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move slowly
toward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the
economy and produce more competitive, export-driven industries.
Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political
controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector is denied both
financing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector is
proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of
growth. Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly
delays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about
Vietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.
Ideological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the
economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment
environment.

@Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting
for more than 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. The islands normally
host 2 million visitors a year. The number of US tourists in the first
five months of 1996 was down by 55% from the same period in 1995, the
lingering result of the fierce hurricanes of 1995. Unemployment rose
sharply in 1996. The manufacturing sector consists of textile,
electronics, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly plants. The
agricultural sector is small, most food being imported. International
business and financial services are a small but growing component of
the economy. One of the world's largest petroleum refineries is at
Saint Croix. A major economic problem at the beginning of 1997 was the
more than $1 billion in governmental arrears, in income tax refunds,
payments to vendors, and overdue wages.

agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood
from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs),
and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government.
Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing
rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food -
particularly flour, sugar, rice, and beef-fuel, clothing, machinery,
and transport equipment, but its exports are negligible, consisting
mostly of breadfruit, yams, and taro root.

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996, but have
not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to
transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative Council elected in
January 1996, as part of interim self-governing arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in
additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement and the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997
Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron. The DOP provides that
Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for
external security and for internal security and public order of
settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined through
direct negotiations.

@West Bank:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered
by tight Israeli security restrictions. Industries using advanced
technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a
lack of local capital and Israeli policies that block the movement of
goods and people. Capital investment consists largely of residential
housing, not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian
firms to compete with Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially
supplemented by workers who commute to jobs in Israel. Worker
remittances from the Persian Gulf states dropped after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, many
Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, increasing unemployment,
and export revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets in
Jordan and the Gulf states. An estimated 147,000 people were in
refugee camps in 1996.

Government type: legal status of territory and question of sovereignty
unresolved; territory contested by Morocco and Polisario Front
(Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de
Oro), which in February 1976 formally proclaimed a government-in-exile
of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR); territory partitioned
between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976, with Morocco acquiring
northern two-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario
guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979;
Morocco moved to occupy that sector shortly thereafter and has since
asserted administrative control; the Polisario's government-in-exile

Economy-overview: Real global output-gross world product (GWP)-rose an
estimated 4.0% in 1997. And, once more, results varied widely among
regions and countries. With its solid 3.8% growth, the US again
accounted for 21% of GWP in 1997. Western Europe grew at 2.5%, not
enough to cut into its high unemployment, and accounted for another
21% of GWP. Japan's faltering economy grew at only 0.9% with its share
of GWP at 8%. The advanced countries as a whole accounted for an
estimated 53% of GWP, with overall growth at 3.0%. The 15 former
Soviet republics and the countries of Eastern Europe posted growth of
1.8%, reversing the long downturn that followed the collapse of
communism. Growth varied widely among these countries, e.g., Ukraine
at a negative 3.2%, Russia at a positive 0.4%, and the Baltic
countries at a strong 7%. The area as a whole accounted for 5% of
global output. China and India, with a combined population of 2.2
billion or 37% of the world total, grew at 8.8% and 5%, respectively.
(China's official GDP statistics probably are overstated.) The
developing countries as a whole contributed 42% to GWP with an overall
growth rate of 5.7%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
control over resources as separatist regional movements-typically
based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in
Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of more than 80 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,
desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of
their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have
inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming
further marginalized. Toward the end of 1997 and on into 1998, serious
financial difficulties in several high-growth East Asia countries cast
a shadow over short-term global economic prospects. The introduction
of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in
January 1999 will pose serious economic risks because of varying
levels of income and cultural and political differences among the
participating nations. (For specific economic developments in each
country of the world in 1997, see the individual country entries.)

@Yemen:Economy

Economy-overview: The northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
a united Yemen, and the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port
facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic
development depends heavily on the attraction of foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge
stemmed partly from the sharp decline in Soviet economic support. The
low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made northern Yemen
dependent on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Once
self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a major
importer. Land once used for export crops-cotton, fruit, and
vegetables - has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat, whose
leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has
no significant export market. Economic growth in former South Yemen
has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from
centralized control over production decisions, investment allocation,
and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been supplemented by remittances
from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis,
however, remittances have dropped substantially. Floods in June 1996
caused the loss of much valuable topsoil in the agricultural sector,
increasing the need for imports of foodstuffs. Oil production and GDP
as a whole are expected to increase moderately in 1998.

@Zambia:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite progress in privatization and budgetary
reform, Zambia's economy has a long way to go. Inflation, while
slowing somewhat, continues to be a major concern to the CHILUBA
government. Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80%
of the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production
rates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by Zambia's
donors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed election,
will severely damage Zambia's economic prospects. Urged by the World
Bank, Zambia has embarked on a privatization program which is to
include the all-important copper industry.

@Zimbabwe:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture employs 27% of the labor force of this
landlocked nation and supplies almost 25% of exports. Mining accounts
for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals
account for about 20% of exports. The government is working to
consolidate earlier progress in developing a market-oriented economy.
Although the IMF suspended support for Zimbabwe's economic structural
adjustment program (ESAP) in 1995, due to government failure to meet
key targets, recent talks between the government and the Fund have
held hope for renewed support if Zimbabwe remains committed to
budgetary targets. A key element of the budget is the Zimbabwe Program
for Socio-Economic Transformation (ZIMPREST), the second phase of
ESAP, whose goals include increased commercialization and
privatization of government-owned enterprises and more
"outward-looking" trade and investment policies. The World Bank
resumed balance of payments support to Zimbabwe in early 1998.
Government officials face the difficult task of restraining
expenditures in their effort to keep inflation within bounds.

@NOTES AND DEFINITIONS

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The country
name Western Samoa has been changed to Samoa. The spelling of
Kazakhstan includes the letter "h" once again; the spelling Kazakstan
is no longer used. Introduction is a category with two entries-Current
issues and Historical perspective-that appears in only a few country
profiles at this time. In the future, this category may be added to
more countries.

Abbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in
the Factbook, with their expansions.

Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the numbers,
designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have
been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the population
according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14
years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a
population will affect a country's investment pattern. Countries with
young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more
in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage
ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age
structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to
find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture-products: This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and
products starting with the most important.

Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s)
may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt,
sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have
facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports-with paved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For
airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups-(1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports-with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces).
For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups-(1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Appendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of
all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Area-comparative: This entry provides an area comparison based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US
or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are
compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in
Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of births
during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in
determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the
level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital
expenditures.

Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical weather
regimes throughout the year.

Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary between
the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Communications: This category deals with the means of exchanging
information and includes the radio, telephone, and television entries.

Communications-note: This entry includes miscellaneous communications
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,
and major amendments.

Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in
color. The maps were produced from the best information available at
the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed
subsequently.

Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's name
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an
example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional
short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short
form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.
Also see the Terminology note.

Currency: This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and
its basic subunit.

Current issues: This entry at the beginning of a country profile
briefly characterizes major geographic, social, political, and
military developments in the past 12 months and may include a
statement about one or two key future trends. This entry appears for
only a few countries at the present time, but may be added to more
countries in the future.

Data code: This entry gives the official US Government digraph that
precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication,
or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This
two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards
Publication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the
Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of
State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and
incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of
area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data
between databases. Appendix F cross-references various country codes
and Appendix G does the same thing for hydrographic codes.

Data codes-country: This information is presented in Appendix F:
Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which includes the US
Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
codes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes,
and Internet codes for land entities.

Data codes-hydrographic: This information is presented in Appendix G:
Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical
Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping
Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for
hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved a
standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard
for country data codes.

Dates of information: The information cutoff date was 1 January 1998,
although a few important changes after that date have been included.
Most demographic statistics are estimates for 1998.

Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of deaths
during a year per l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the
mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current
mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly
affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show
a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in
mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging
population.

Debt-external: This entry gives the total amount of public foreign
financial obligations.

Dependency status: This entry describes the formal relationship
between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all
nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular
independent state.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 independent states, including 178 of the 185 UN members
(excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former
Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic
relations with 6 independent states that are not in the UN-Holy See,
Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Diplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes the chief
of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX
number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the chief of
the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone number, FAX number,
consulate general locations, consulate locations, honorary consulate
general locations, and honorary consulate locations.

Disputes-international: This entry includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;
however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is
defined as financial assistance, which is concessional in character,
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions
are also official government assistance, but with a main objective
other than economic development and with a grant element less than
25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im
Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent. The entry is separated into two components-donor and
recipient.

Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the size,
development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,
labor, and capital.

Economy-overview: This entry briefly describes the type of economy,
including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic
development, the most important natural resources, and the unique
areas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events
and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a
statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity-capacity: This entry gives the maximum designed potential
for electricity production expressed in kilowatts.

Electricity-consumption per capita: This entry gives the figure for
annual electricity generation plus imports, minus exports, and divided
by total population for the same year expressed in kilowatt hours.

Electricity-production: This entry gives the annual amount of
electricity actually generated expressed in kilowatt hours.

Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest point and the
lowest point.

Entities: Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are
not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or
for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the
US Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The
World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

participation in international environmental agreements into two
levels-party to and signed but not ratified. Agreements are listed in
alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements: This information is presented in Appendix D:
Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the
name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into
force, objective, and parties by category.

Ethnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups
starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population.

Exchange rates: This entry provides the official value of a country's
monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as
expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined
by international market forces or official fiat.

Executive branch: This entry includes several subfields. Chief of
state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may
not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head
of government includes the name and title of the administrative leader
who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. Cabinet includes the official name for this body of
advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections includes
the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last
election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the
percent of vote for each candidate in the last election. In the UK,
the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is the head
of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and
the head of government.

Exports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total
US dollar amount of exports on an f.o.b. basis. Commodities is a rank
ordering of exported products starting with the most important and
sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners is a rank
ordering of trading partners starting with the most important and
sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.

Fiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for
a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the
calendar year but may begin in any month. FY93/94 refers to the fiscal
year that began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994.
All yearly references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated
as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).

Flag description: This entry provides a written flag description
produced from actual flags or the best information available at the
time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used
by their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local
flag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at
the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced
from actual flags or the best information available at the time of
preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their
dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all
final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP
dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power
parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more
information.

GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations
rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The
PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price
weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and
services produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP
method provide a better comparison of economic well-being between
countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the
corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.
When converted at PPP rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of
goods in any country. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are
quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough
approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation
of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program
(UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the
University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency
exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic
financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output.
In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are
tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,
of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One
important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,
for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures.
Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained
together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in
the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical
agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes
in national statistical methods and practices. For statistical series
on GDP and other economic variables, see the Handbook of International
Economic Statistics available from the same sources as The World
Factbook.

GDP-composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP.

GDP-per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity
basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP-real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis
adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.

Geographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude and
longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate
geographic center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of
Conventional Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic
Names and on other sources.

Geographic names: This information is presented in Appendix H:
Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates where various
geographic names-including alternate names, former names, political or
geographical portions of larger entities, and the location of all US
Foreign Service Posts-can be found in The World Factbook. Spellings
are normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in parentheses,
while additional information is included in brackets.

Geography: This category includes the entries dealing with the natural
environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography-note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

GNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from
domestic production. The Factbook uses GDP rather than GNP to measure
national production.

Government: This category includes the entries dealing with the system
for the adoption and administration of public policy.

Government type: This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g.,
republic, constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary
democracy, military dictatorship).

Government-note: This entry includes miscellaneous government
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Gross domestic product: see GDP

Gross national product: see GNP

Gross world product: see GWP

GWP: This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value
of all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.

Heliports: This entry gives the total number of established helicopter
takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other
services).

Highways: This entry includes the total length of the highway system
as well as the length of the paved and unpaved components.

Historical perspective: This entry at the beginning of a country
profile contains a brief summary of the background information
necessary to understand the current situation in a country. The entry
appears for only a few countries at the present time, but may be added
to more countries in the future.

Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five categories of
illicit drugs- narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),
hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs
legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside of medical channels.
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which
provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes
marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that
contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused
with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making
chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca
bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and
anxiety and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal,
Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium),
methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil,
Placidyl, Valmid).
Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.
Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical
substance that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral
impairment in an individual.
Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical
depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as
mandrax in Southwest Asia.
Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep,
and refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes.
Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine
(MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with
codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include
heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).
Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe
seedpod of the opium poppy.
Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the
natural and semisynthetic narcotics.
Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the
mature, dried opium poppy.
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of
Catha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone,
a pharmaceutical depressant.
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase
energy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack),
amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin),
methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total
US dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f. or f.o.b. basis. Commodities
is a rank ordering of imported products starting with the most
important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners
is a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most
important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.

Independence: For most countries, this entry gives the date that
sovereignty was achieved, and from what nation, empire, or
trusteeship. For the other countries, the date given may not represent
''independence'' in the strict sense, but rather some significant
nationhood event such as traditional founding date, date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental
change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas
include the notation ''none'' followed by the nature of their
dependency status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the annual
percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,
mining, and construction).

Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting
with the largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths of
infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births
occurring in the same year. The infant mortality rate is often used an
indicator of the level of health in a country.

Inflation rate-consumer price index: This entry furnishes the annual
percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's
consumer prices.

International disputes: see Disputes-international

International organization participation: This entry lists in
alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations
in which the subject country is a member or participates in some other
way.

International organizations: This information is presented in Appendix
C: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,
abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX, date established, aim, and
members by category.

Introduction: This category includes two entries-Current issues and
Historical perspective. At present it appears in only a few country
profiles, but may be added to others in the future.

Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square kilometers of
land area that is artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the highest
court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.

Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force figure and a
rank ordering of component parts by occupation.

Land boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all land
boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous
border countries.

Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area
for five different types of land use. Arable land-land cultivated for
crops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and
rice. Permanent crops-land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber. Permanent
pastures-land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops. Forests
and woodland-land under dense or open stands of trees. Other- any land
type not specifically mentioned above, such as urban areas, roads,
desert, etc.

Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population speaking that language.

Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the legal
system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of
International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the structure
(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and
term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number
of seats held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components.
Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life
in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be
thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial
measures.

Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census
Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There
are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common
definition-the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing
the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to
read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is
probably the most easily available and valid for international
comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can
impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
changing, technology-driven world.

Location: This entry identifies the country's regional location,
neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference
map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic
coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.

Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims: contiguous
zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing
zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country),
other (unique maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line
or North Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The
proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from
being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil
rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or
register. This entry contains information in two subfields-total and
ships by type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or
over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. Ships
by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo
ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers,
container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock
carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger
ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo
ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,
specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.
A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a
territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use
of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an
offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register.
Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent
country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature
of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may
also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of
convenience register, except that it is not the register of an
independent state.
A flag of convenience register is a national register
offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state.
The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers
by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and
liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by
having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the
flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under
a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the
majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to
as an open register.
A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and
which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at
home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how
a ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be
placed on the register.
An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign
nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are
the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been
instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of
convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and
Danish flags.
A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against
payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship
but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.
A register is the record of a ship's ownership and
nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country;
also, it is the compendium of such individual ships' registrations.
Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it
subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag
state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Military: This category includes the entries dealing with a country's
military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military branches: This entry lists the names of the ground, naval,
air, marine, and other defense or military-type forces.

Military expenditures-dollar figure: This entry gives current military
expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by multiplying
the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the gross
domestic product (GDP) calculated on an exchange rate basis not
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with
caution because of different price patterns and accounting methods
among nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their
currencies.

Military expenditures-percent of GDP: This entry gives current
military expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).

Military manpower-availability: This entry gives the total numbers of
males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit
to serve.

Military manpower-fit for military service: This entry gives the
number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This
is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability
which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and
reduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of
the actual number fit to serve.

Military manpower-military age: This entry gives the minimum age at
which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject
to conscription.

Military manpower-reaching military age annually: This entry gives the
number of draft-age males and females entering the military manpower
pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability of
draft-age young adults.

Military-note: This entry includes miscellaneous military information
of significance not included elsewhere.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of
government.

National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day of
celebration- usually independence day.

Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for
citizens-noun and adjective.

Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,
hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the difference
between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during
the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of
persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,
3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The
net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the
overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife
(if people are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in
certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

People: This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People-note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information
of significance not included elsewhere.

Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for
transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products.

Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing of
significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a listing
of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing
for legislative election.

Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the
Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past
and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents
one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the
world and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections.
In 1998 these countries are Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma,
Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia,
Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria,
Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe.

Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The
rate may be positive or negative. Also known as growth rate or average
annual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor in determining how
great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of
its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,
roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid
population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and harbors
selected on the basis of overall importance to each country. This is
determined by evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of
goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).

Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total number of AM,
FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.

Railways: This entry includes the total length of the railway network
and component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and
other.

Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and special or
current interest maps.

Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population.

Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each female in
five age groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and
over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some
countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners. The sex ratio
at birth for the World is 1.06 (1998 est.).

Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the
right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of
the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)
in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not
presented is the international access code, which varies from country
to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call
placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:
011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where
    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls
    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
    [34] is the country code for Spain,
    (1) is the city code for Madrid,
    577 is the local exchange, and
    xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial telephone call placed from another
country to the US would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where
    [1] is the country code for the US,
    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
    939 is the local exchange, and
    xxxx is the local telephone number.

Telephones: This entry gives the total number of subscribers.

Television-broadcast stations: This entry gives the total number of
separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.

Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television sets.

Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook
database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,
the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil
defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The
Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and
former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates
such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are
not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of
their dependency status noted in this same entry. The National Capital
entry includes the first-order administrative seat for ''nations'' or
independent states as well as dependencies and other Factbook
entities.

Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the average number
of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end
of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given
fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct
measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it
refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for
population growth in the country. High rates will also place some
limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers
of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit
the capacity of the families to educate their children.

Transnational Issues: This category includes only two entries at the
present time-Disputes-international and Illicit drugs-that deal with
current issues going beyond national boundaries.

Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing with the
movement of people or material.

Transportation-note: This entry includes miscellaneous transportation
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the labor force
that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

United Nations System: This information is presented in Appendix B:
United Nations System as a chart, table, or text (depending on the
version of the Factbook) that shows the organization of the UN in
detail.

Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual names of
navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Weights and measures: This information is presented in Appendix E:
Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical
powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,
weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting
period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is
an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.
FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and
ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates. The Handbook of International Economic
Statistics, published annually in September by the Central
Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, the successor nations to the Soviet Union, and selected
other countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever the Factbook is
available.

Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) ceases to
exist. None of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia,
including Serbia and Montenegro, have been permitted to participate
solely on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the
United Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and
their subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations specialized
agencies. The United Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate
of the SFRY to remain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to
function, and continues to fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For
a variety of reasons, a number of other organizations have not yet
taken action with regard to the membership of the former Yugoslavia.
The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia under
international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where no
action has yet been taken.

Note: At this time, only three countries-Burma, Liberia, and the
US-have not adopted the International System of Units (SI, or metric
system) as their official system of weights and measures. Although use
of the metric system has been sanctioned by law in the US since 1866,
it has been slow in displacing the American adaptation of the British
Imperial System known as the US Customary System. The US is the only
industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in
its commercial and standards activities, but there is increasing
acceptance in science, medicine, government, and many sectors of
industry.

FIPS 10-4: Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and
Their Principal Administrative Divisions (FIPS PUB 10-4) is maintained
by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues (Department of
State) and published by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Department of Commerce). These two-character alphabetic
codes are included in the text of the Factbook in the Data code entry
under the Government category. FIPS 10-4 codes are intended for
general use throughout the US Government, especially in activities
associated with the mission of the Department of State and national
defense programs.

ISO 3166: Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries (ISO
3166) is prepared by the International Organization for
Standardization. ISO 3166 includes two- and three-character alphabetic
codes and three-digit numeric codes that may be needed for activities
involving exchange of data with international organizations that have
adopted that standard. Except for the numeric codes, ISO 3166 codes
have been adopted in the US as FIPS 104-1: American National Standard
Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries, Dependencies, and
Areas of Special Sovereignty for Information Interchange.

Internet: This is a provisional compilation that generally agrees with
the ISO 3166 two-character alphabetic codes.

Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint
independent state,but this entity has not been formally recognized as
a state by the US; the US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved and that none of the successor
republics represents its continuation.

The US Government has not yet adopted a standard for hydrographic
codes similar to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
10-4 country codes. The names and limits of the following oceans and
seas are not always directly comparable because of differences in the
customers, needs, and requirements of the individual organizations.
Even the number of principal water bodies varies from organization to
organization. Factbook users, for example, find the Atlantic Ocean and
Pacific Ocean entries useful, but none of the following standards
include those oceans in their entirety. Nor is there any provision for
combining codes or overcodes to aggregate water bodies.

@HISTORY OF THE WORLD FACTBOOK

  A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook
  _________________________________________________________________

The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is
acquired, converted into intelligence, and made available to
policymakers. Information is raw data from any source, data that may
be fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or
wrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,
integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished
intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to
be delivered to the policymaker.

The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports
on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.
The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the
foundation on which the other two are constructed; current
intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and
estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and
issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The
World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National
Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished
intelligence.

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they
been coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have
highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since
that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) CIA's World Factbook.

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home
to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed
coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as
Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In
the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch
amphibious operations against many islands about which information was
unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared.

In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of
Naval Intelligence-ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the
Office of Strategic Services-OSS) decided that a joint effort should
be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that
recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing
Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy
Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental
basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government
for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic
intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34
JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous
letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.
Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,
"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based
planners."

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar
world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author
on national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than
war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human
activities--not just the enemy and his war production."

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime
replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country
sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more
comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior
produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.

The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955
that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication
which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all
areas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing
requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date." The Factbook was
created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS
studies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,
and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS
program was terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and
gazetteer components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made
available to the public with sales through the US Government Printing
Office (GPO). The 1996 edition was the first to be printed by GPO. The
year 1998 marks the 51st anniversary of the establishment of the
Central Intelligence Agency and the 55th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and
its two predecessor programs.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
