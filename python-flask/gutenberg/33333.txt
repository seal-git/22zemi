Statute of Anne: Preparer's Notes

Created from various public domain versions.


Repetition of last words on pages eliminated,
Latin intro and extro translated into English.
End of line hyphenations removed for searching.
Typo of "peny" for "penny" has been corrected,
with the elimination of the accompanying sic.
Also "seasonable" replaced by "reasonable" with
the removal of that sic, as well.  "Queens" is
replaced with "queen's", and "majesties" would
become "majesty's", "entred" becomes "entered"
and these typos were often in multiple places.

"Vice-Chancellors" and "Vice Chancellors" both
appeared so I chose "Vice Chancellors" just to
make searches more simple.

I have not changed any of the apparently quite
random capitalizations [random in comparisons,
I should say to German, etc.], nor changed any
of the more different spellings, as inhaunced.

I would like to comment just how obvious it is
that the rights of the authors was an "add on"
to this document, taking place only on a sixth
sheet containing only two small paragraphs, as
this makes it even more obvious just how every
right was originally for "The Stationers," who
are now descended as by The World Intellectual
Property Organization through various means.

This law was proposed and defeated 250 years--
from its first draft by The Stationers just as
The Gutenberg Press got going to this period.

All monarchs, and Oliver Cromwell, refused it,
on grounds it gave too much to The Stationers,
and left too little to the public, as per:

Henry VI        1 Sep 1422    4 Mar 1461

Anne            8 Mar 1702    1 Aug 1714


Please note that this 250 year span included reigns
from the son of Henry V of Shakespearian fame and a
greater Shakespearian epic of Richard III, to those
six wives of Henry VIII, Mary Queen of Scots, and a
host of the most turbulent reigns of UK history and
in all this time not one of these rulers would give
The Stationers such great power that has now passed
down, not only unchecked, but greatly enhanced over
the next 300 years.  The average copyright moved to
about 100 years in length in that time from 15 year
average original terms [nearly none were renewed].

My own words are mine alone, though I appreciate it
when people offer corrections, advice, etc., though
I don't always take it.  However, I do always offer
to publish their own version along with mine.

Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late
frequently taken the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting, and Publishing, or
causing to be Printed, Reprinted, and Published Books, and other
Writings, without the Consent of the Authors or Proprietors of such
Books and Writings, to their very great Detriment, and too often to the
Ruin of them and their Families: For Preventing therefore such Practices
for the future, and for the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and
Write useful Books; May it please Your Majesty, that it may be Enacted,
and be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the
Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in
this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same,
That from and after the Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven hundred
and ten, the Author of any Book or Books already Printed, who hath not
Transferred to any other the Copy or Copies of such Book or Books, Share
or Shares thereof, or the Bookseller or Booksellers, Printer or
Printers, or other Person or Persons, who hath or have Purchased or
Acquired the Copy or Copies of any Book or Books, in order to Print or
Reprint the same, shall have the sole Right and Liberty of Printing such
Book and Books for the Term of One and twenty Years, to Commence from
the said Tenth Day of April, and no longer; and that the Author of any
Book or Books already Composed and not Printed and Published, or that

Reprinted, or Imported any such Book or Books, without the Consent of
the Proprietor or Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing,

Signed in the Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses; or knowing the
same to be so Printed or Reprinted, without the Consent of the
Proprietors, shall Sell, Publish, or Expose to Sale, or cause to be
Sold, Published, or Exposed to Sale, any such Book or Books, without
such Consent first had and obtained, as aforesaid, Then such Offender or
Offenders shall Forfeit such Book or Books, and all and every Sheet or
Sheets, being part of such Book or Books, to the Proprietor or
Proprietors of the Copy thereof, who shall forthwith Damask and make
Waste-Paper of them: And further, That every such Offender or Offenders,
shall Forfeit One Penny for every sheet which shall be found in his,
her, or their Custody, either Printed or Printing, Published or Exposed
to Sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Act, the one
Moiety thereof to the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, Her Heirs and
Successors, and the other Moiety thereof to any Person or Persons that
shall Sue for the same, to be Recovered in any of Her Majesty's Courts
of Record at Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or
Information, in which no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege, or
Protection, or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.

And whereas many Persons may through Ignorance Offend against this Act,
unless some Provision be made whereby the Property in every such Book,
as is intended by this Act to be Secured to the proprietor or
Proprietors thereof, may be ascertained, as likewise the Consent of such
Proprietor or Proprietors for the Printing or Reprinting of such Book or
Books may from time to time be known; Be it therefore further Enacted by
the Authority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to extend to subject any Bookseller, Printer, or other Person
whatsoever, to the Forfeitures or Penalties therein mentioned, for or by
reason of the Printing or Reprinting of any Book or Books without such
Consent, as aforesaid, unless the Title to the Copy of such Book or
Books hereafter Published shall, before such Publication be Entered, in
the Register-Book of the Company of Stationers, in such manner as hath
been usual, which Register-Book shall at all times be kept at the Hall

Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses, That then such Person and
Persons so refusing, Notice being first duly given of such Refusal, by
an Advertisement in the Gazette, shall have the like Benefit, as if such
Entry or Entries, Certificate or Certificates had been duly made and
given; and that the Clerks so refusing, shall, for any such Offence,
Forfeit to the Proprietor of such Copy or Copies the Sum of Twenty
Pounds, to be Recovered in any of Her Majesty's Courts of Record at
Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information, in which
no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege or Protection, or more than one
Imparlance shall be allowed.

Printers, and to Examine and Enquire of the reason of the Dearness and
Inhauncement of the Price or Value of such Book or Books by him or them
so Sold or Exposed to Sale; and if upon such Enquiry and Examination it

Anno Octavo
AnnRegin

An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vest-
ing the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or
Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein
mentioned.

Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other
Persons, have of late frequently taken
the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting,
and Publishing, or causing to be Print-
ed, Reprinted, and Published Books,
and other Writings, without the Con-
sent of the Authors or Proprietors of
such Books and Writings, to their
very great Detriment, and too often
to the Ruin of them and their Fami-
lies: For Preventing therefore such
Practices for the future, and for the
Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write use-
ful Books; May it please Your Majesty, that it may be En-
acted, and be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty,
by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled,
and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the
Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, the
Author of any Book or Books already Printed, who hath not
Transferred to any other the Copy or Copies of such Book or
Books, Share or Shares thereof, or the Bookseller or Book-
sellers, Printer or Printers, or other Person or Persons, who
hath or have Purchased or Acquired the Copy or Copies of any
Book or Books, in order to Print or Reprint the same, shall
have the sole Right and Liberty of Printing such Book and
Books for the Term of One and twenty Years, to Commence
from the said Tenth Day of April, and no longer; and that
the Author of any Book or Books already Composed and not
Printed and Published, or that shall hereafter be Composed, and
his Assignee, or Assigns, shall have the sole Liberty of Printing
and Reprinting such Book and Books for the Term of four
-teen


page 2

teen Years, to Commence from the Day of the First Publish-
ing the same, and no longer; And that if any other Bookseller,
Printer, or other Person whatsoever, from and after the Tenth
Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, within the
times Granted and Limited by this Act, as aforesaid, shall Print,
Reprint, or Import, or cause to be Printed, Reprinted, or Imported
any such Book or Books, without the Consent of the Proprietor or
Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing, Signed
in the Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses; or knowing
the same to be so Printed or Reprinted, without the Consent of
the Proprietors, shall Sell, Publish, or Expose to Sale, or cause
to be Sold, Published, or Exposed to Sale, any such Book or
Books, without such Consent first had and obtained, as afore-
said, Then such Offender or Offenders shall Forfeit such Book or
Books, and all and every Sheet or Sheets, being part of such
Book or Books, to the Proprietor or Proprietors of the Copy
thereof, who shall forthwith Damask and make Waste-Paper of
them: And further, That every such Offender or Offenders, shall
Forfeit One Peny [sic] for every sheet which shall be found in his,
her, or their Custody, either Printed or Printing, Published or
Exposed to Sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of
this Act, the one Moiety thereof to the Queens [sic] most Excellent
Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety
thereof to any Person or Persons that shall Sue for the same,
to be Recovered in any of Her Majesties [sic] Courts of Record at
Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information,
in which no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege, or Protection,
or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.

And whereas many Persons may through Ignorance Offend
against this Act, unless some Provision be made whereby the Pro-
perty in every such Book, as is intended by this Act to be Se-
cured to the proprietor or Proprietors thereof, may be ascertain-
ed, as likewise the Consent of such Proprietor or Proprietors for the
Printing or Reprinting of such Book or Books may from time
to time be known; Be it therefore further Enacted by the Au-
thority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to extend to subject any Bookseller, Printer, or other
Person whatsoever, to the Forfeitures or Penalties therein men-
tioned, for or by reason of the Printing or Reprinting of any Book
or Books without such Consent, as aforesaid, unless the Title
to the Copy of such Book or Books hereafter Published shall,
before such Publication be Entred [sic], in the Register-Book of the
Company of Stationers, in such manner as hath been usual,
which Register-Book shall at all times be kept at the Hall of
the said Company, and unless such Consent of the Proprietor
or Proprietors be in like manner Entred [sic], as aforesaid, for every
of which several Entries, Six Pence shall be Paid, and no
more; which said Register-Book may, at all Seasonable [sic; should be:

pany of Stationers, for the time being shall Refuse or Neglect to
Register, or make such Entry or Entries, or to give such Cer-
tificate, being thereunto Required by the Author or Proprietor of
such Copy or Copies, in the Presence of Two or more Credible
Witnesses, That then such Person and Persons so refusing, No-

in the Gazette, shall have the like Benefit, as if such Entry or
Entries, Certificate or Certificates had been duly made and gi-
ven; and that the Clerks so refusing, shall, for any such Offence,
Forfeit to the Proprietor of such Copy or Copies the Sum of

Plaint, or Information, in which no Wager of Law, Essoign,
Privilege or Protection, or more than one Imparlance shall
be allowed.

the Authority aforesaid, That if any Bookseller or Booksellers,
Printer or Printers, shall, after the said Five and twentieth

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
