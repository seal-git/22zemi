Description of a New Softshell Turtle
From the Southeastern United States

BY

ROBERT G. WEBB


Examination of softshell turtles allied to _Trionyx muticus_ from the
southeastern United States discloses the presence of an undescribed
subspecies inhabiting river systems of the Gulf Coast.

The author is indebted to Mr. Roger Conant for constructive criticism
of the manuscript. I am grateful also to many fellow students for
assistance in field work or for other courtesies, especially William E.
Brode, Franklin Sogandares-Bernal, Ernest A. Liner, Donald W. Tinkle,
Paul K. Anderson, and John K. Greer. The photographs were provided
through the cooperation of Roger and Isabelle Hunt Conant and John M.
Legler.

Collections from which specimens were obtained are as follows: TU
(Tulane University), USNM (United States National Museum), MCZ (Museum
of Comparative Zoology, Harvard College), CNHM (Chicago Natural History
Museum), KU (Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas), UI
(Museum of Natural History, University of Illinois).

Measurements (in millimeters) were made with a Vernier caliper and a
metal tape; those of the holotype were made to the nearest one-tenth
millimeter. Plastral length was measured from the posterior edge of the
plastron to the anteriormost edge of the ventral surface; other
measurements were maximal. Depth of shell was taken only on hatchlings
and an immature female. Hatchlings were arbitrarily designated as
specimens having plastrons shorter than 44 mm; sex of all specimens
except adult males was determined by dissection unless otherwise noted.

     Pearl River, Roses Bluff, 14 miles northeast Jackson, Rankin
     County, Mississippi; obtained by William F. Childers on
     August 25, 1952 (Plate 1).

     _Paratypes._--A total of 20 alcoholic specimens: TU 17301,
     hatchling male (Plate 2). TU 17302-.1, 16682, three
     hatchling females, and TU 13473, adult female, from the

     four hatchling females, from the Pearl River, Varnado,
     Washington Parish, Louisiana; TU 17305, immature female, no
     data.

     _Diagnosis and definition._--A subspecies of softshell
     turtle most closely allied to _Trionyx muticus muticus_ but
     differing from that subspecies in having: (1) a juvenal
     pattern of large, circular spots, (2) no stripes on dorsal
     surface of snout, and (3) postocular stripe with thick,
     black borders immediately behind eye in adult males. _T. m.
     calvatus_ resembles _T. m. muticus_, and differs from the
     several subspecies of _Trionyx spinifer_ in having: (1) no
     enlarged tubercles on anterior edge of carapace, (2) no
     ridge projecting from nasal septum, and (3) a smooth dorsal
     surface on carapace in adult males. _T. m. calvatus_ and _T.
     m. muticus_ resemble _T. ferox_ in having a smooth dorsal
     surface on carapace in adult males, but differ from _T.
     ferox_ in having: (1) no tubercles along anterior edge of
     carapace, and (2) no ridge projecting from nasal septum.

     _Description of holotype._--Carapace circular, widest at
     region of bridge; margin entire; dorsal surface smooth;
     anterior margin of carapace lacking tubercles; blunt
     vertebral ridge evident anteriorly; maximum length, 53.1 mm;
     greatest width, 46.3 mm; greatest depth, 11.5 mm.

     Plastron small, extending slightly farther forward than
     carapace; anterior lobe truncate with slight midventral
     indentation; posterior lobe rounded, sides forming acute
     angle; certain features of bony elements of plastron visible
     through overlying skin; width of bony bridge, 4.5 mm;
     maximum length of plastron, 37.5 mm.

     Head extended to level of eyes; head terminating in long,
     rounded, flexible snout; nostrils rounded with no ridges
     projecting from nasal septum; jaws closed, each covered by
     fleshy lips except anteriorly where horny portions of jaws
     are exposed; iris with dark stripe through pupil.

     Forefeet and hind feet well-webbed and with five digits
     each; each limb with nails on first three digits; dorsal
     surface of each forelimb with four cornified areas, three of
     which have a free edge; each hind limb with two cornified
     areas, one smooth on posterodorsal surface and other with
     free edge on posteroventral surface.

     Tail terminating in flexible point and not extending beyond
     posterior edge of carapace; anus to tip of tail, 2.6 mm;
     anus to posterior edge of carapace, 8.1 mm.

     In preservative: Ground color of carapace dark tan having
     pattern of 49 brownish spots; 47 spots circular; two spots
     noticeably elongate, one representing fusion of two circular
     spots; 17 spots on carapace not exceeding 2.0 mm in
     diameter, whereas 32 spots range from 2.5 to 4.0 mm in
     diameter; periphery of carapace pale except anteriorly;
     maximum width of pale margin (posteriorly), 3.3 mm; junction
     of pale margin and dorsal ground color formed by rough-edged
     line composed of small, closely-set dots; pattern of fine
     punctations and other marks on dorsal surface of forelimbs
     and hind limbs.

     Ground color of underparts whitish, lacking markings; top of
     head and snout gray, lacking markings; lower eyelids with
     small dark dots.

     _Description of paratypes._--Adult females (2 specimens). No
     striping on dorsal surface of snout; pale postocular stripe
     not distinct, dark borders obscure (head not extended in TU
     13473); carapace circular, pale brown with mottled pattern;
     carapace lacking pattern of large spots; dark marks present
     in pale margin of carapace; dorsal surface of soft parts of
     body finely stippled, larger marks on hind limbs and on
     anterior surface of forelimbs near their insertions;
     plastron and ventral surface of soft parts of body without
     markings. Maximal measurements, respectively, are: length of
     plastron, 172 and 180 mm; length of carapace, 238 and 263
     mm; width of carapace, 203 and 218 mm; width of head, 28
     and? mm.

     Immature female (1 specimen). Carapace circular having
     juvenal pattern of large spots, some of which have borders
     darker than their centers and are best described as ocelli;
     junction of pale margin and ground color of carapace formed
     by ill-defined, ragged dark border; dorsal surface of
     forelimbs and hind limbs finely streaked and dotted, larger
     marks occurring toward insertions of forelimbs; lower border
     of pale postocular stripe in contact with upper margin of
     postlabial pale stripe; no stripes on dorsal surface of
     snout; fine markings on dorsal surface of neck. Maximal
     measurements are: length of plastron, 56 mm; length of
     carapace, 82 mm; width of carapace, 77 mm; depth of shell,
     13 mm; width of head, 12 mm.

     Adult males (3 specimens). No striping on dorsal surface of
     snout; pale postocular stripe with thick, black borders
     immediately behind eye; width of black borders equal to
     approximately one-half width of pale postocular stripe;
     dorsal surface of soft parts of body with indistinct
     markings that are larger on hind limbs; plastron and ventral
     surface of soft parts of body without markings; small dark
     spots posteriorly along ventral edge of carapace; pale
     margin of carapace lacking markings or having few small
     black spots; carapace circular with or without pattern of
     large spots. Maximal measurements of smallest and largest
     specimens, respectively, are: length of plastron, 108 and
     118 mm; length of carapace, 160 and 177 mm; width of
     carapace, 142 and 152 mm; width of head, 21 mm.

     Hatchlings (14 specimens). These paratypes resemble the
     holotype in all features mentioned; markings on neck tend to
     form longitudinal streaks in TU 17303 and 17304. There are
     no secondary sexual differences in hatchling turtles.

     There is some variation in hatchling turtles. Four from the
     Escambia River have dorsal spots 3 mm or larger in greatest
     diameter and on three specimens the dorsal spots number 27,
     37 and 37 (total number not discernable in TU 16682); none
     of the dorsal spots is ocellate. Maximal measurements of
     these three hatchlings, respectively, are: length of
     plastron, 35, 36 and 37 mm; length of carapace, 50, 50 and
     52 mm; width of carapace, 44, 45 and 47 mm; depth of shell,
     11 mm; width of head, 9 mm. Nine hatchlings from the Pearl
     River at Varnado have more (all small) dorsal spots, which
     may be ocellate. The dorsal spots and ocelli do not exceed 2
     mm in their greatest diameter except that some of those of
     TU 17304 are 3 mm; the spots range in number from 38 (TU
     17303) to 63 (TU 17304). Maximal measurements of the
     smallest and largest specimens, holotype excepted, are:
     length of plastron, 30 and 33 mm; length of carapace, 42
     and 46 mm; width of carapace, 37 and 43 mm; depth of shell,
     9 and 10 mm; width of head, 9 and 10 mm. The holotype
     resembles hatchlings from the Escambia River in having
     large, non-ocellate dorsal spots 3 mm in greatest diameter,
     and larger measurements.

     One other specimen (not designated as a paratype),
     consisting of a head with a few attached cervical vertebrae,
     was obtained on a sand bank of the Escambia River, Florida.
     The postocular stripe, bright yellow with black borders, was
     especially vivid in this adult male (KU 47116).

indicate records in the literature. The question mark refers to a
specimen bearing catalogue number 17236 in the collection of Tulane
University (see comments on page 524 concerning No. 17236 from the
Amite River).]

     _Range._--_Trionyx m. calvatus_ is known from the Pearl,
     Pascagoula and Escambia river drainages and is to be
     expected in the Tombigbee-Alabama river drainage (Fig. 1).
     Tinkle (1958:41, fig. 53, stippled) has indicated the
     probable range of _calvatus_. This subspecies is unknown
     from the Mississippi and Tennessee river drainages, which
     are inhabited by _T. m. muticus_. The western limit of
     distribution is the Pearl River drainage and probably those
     streams of the Florida Parishes of Louisiana that drain into
     Lake Ponchartrain. The most easterly record of occurrence
     for _T. m. calvatus_ is in the Escambia River drainage; the
     eastern extent of geographic range is not known.

     I have seen three preserved young turtles having the
     characteristic spotted pattern from the Pascagoula drainage
     in eastern Mississippi. These specimens are uncatalogued and
     in the collections at Mississippi Southern College,
     Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

     There is a specimen of _T. m. muticus_ labeled as from
     Mobile, Alabama (MCZ 1596), for which I believe the locality
     datum is incorrect. It is a young turtle having a
     well-defined pattern on the carapace and is without doubt a
     representative of _T. m. muticus_. Mobile is in the large
     drainage basin, of the Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Coosa and
     Alabama rivers, which is between the Escambia and Pearl
     rivers.

     Yarrow (1882:28) reported a specimen of _Amyda mutica_, USNM
     11630, from Gainesville, Florida. This record was questioned
     by Cahn (1937:179), and has been disregarded by subsequent
     authors. Stejneger (1944:23) lists this specimen number with
     uncertainty from Mt. Carmel, Illinois. The exact geographic
     provenance of this specimen is seemingly unknown.

     _Habitat._--I have collected eggs of _T. m. calvatus_ on
     sand banks of the Escambia River, Florida. The Escambia
     River has a sand-gravel bottom, extensive sandy banks, a
     moderately-rapid current, and is flanked by a thick riparian
     forest. It is approximately 80 feet wide with fallen trees
     and brush intermittently emergent along the shoreline. The
     sand bar-habitat along the Pearl River has been mentioned by
     Anderson (1958:212). All records thus far are from lotic
     habitats.

     _Comparisons._--_Trionyx m. calvatus_ is most closely
     related to _Trionyx m. muticus_. Both subspecies have the
     following characteristics: (1) no enlarged tubercles on the
     anterior edge of the carapace, (2) no ridge projecting from
     the nasal septum, and (3) a smooth carapace in adult males.
     These characters distinguish these two subspecies from the
     several subspecies of _T. spinifer_, and, except for the
     smooth carapace in adult males, from _T. ferox_. Another
     feature of _T. m. calvatus_ and _T. m. muticus_, not known
     to be definitive or diagnostic but noticed on occasion, is
     the pale orange cast, in life, of the dorsal surface of the
     carapace and soft parts of the body in young of these
     turtles.

     The spotted pattern of juveniles of _calvatus_ is easily
     distinguished from the pattern of _muticus_ (small dots,
     streaks and dashes) figured by Agassiz (1857, vol. 2, pt. 3,
     pl. 6, fig. 6), Smith (1950:154, fig. 104), Conant
     (1938:192, pl. 21, fig. 1; 1958, pl. 11, opposite p. 94),
     and Cahn (1937:177, pl. 24C).

     Unfortunately, the distinctive dorsal spotting in young
     _calvatus_ becomes obscure or absent in some adults of both
     sexes. Spotting in large males is not so well-defined as in
     juveniles; it may be absent (TU 17306.3), or indicated by
     two obscure spots (KU 17117), but is usually evident, at
     least posteriorly. The spotted pattern is absent in large
     females, which have a pale, mottled and blotched pattern of
     lichen-like figures; dorsal spots are obscure in TU 17305
     (length of plastron, 56 mm).

     Two additional features are, so far as known, universal in
     _calvatus_; these are: (1) the absence of striping on the
     dorsal surface of the snout, and (2) the presence of thick,
     black borders of the postocular stripe in adult males. These
     features have also been observed in some specimens of
     _muticus_; their presence in _muticus_ cannot be properly
     evaluated at this time, and is seemingly not due to
     individual variation. These two characters, however, coupled
     with the distinctive juvenile pattern of spots, serve, in
     combination, to distinguish _calvatus_ from _muticus_.

_Discussion._--The two populations are recognized as subspecies
because: (1) there is close resemblance, (2) the diagnostic characters
pertaining to pattern are few and superficial, and (3) the geographic
ranges are allopatric, but juxtaposed. It is probable that _muticus_
and _calvatus_ would be capable of interbreeding if they were not
spatially isolated. It should be pointed out, however, that there is no
evidence of intergradation between _muticus_ and _calvatus_ in the
lower Mississippi Valley as has been reported for the subspecies of _T.
spinifer_ (Conant and Goin, 1948), and that the degree of difference
between _calvatus_ and _muticus_ is greater than that between some
subspecies of _T. spinifer_.

     _Specimens examined._--All the localities listed below are
     plotted on the distribution map (Fig. 1). Only those
     specimens of _T. muticus muticus_ are listed that serve to
     delimit the range of _T. m. calvatus_. Fortunately, the
     identification of the specimens of _muticus_ is certain as
     all show the characteristic juvenile pattern, except the
     large female, TU 7543, from southeastern Louisiana. USNM
     95133-34 (carapaces and plastrons only) and TU 17236 are
     females, which lack the diagnostic spotted pattern of
     _calvatus_; the former are referred to this subspecies on
     geographic grounds (Pearl River at Columbia, Mississippi).
     TU 17236, from the Amite River, is dubiously relegated to
     _calvatus_ on the supposition that this river and others in
     the Lake Ponchartrain drainage will yield the characteristic
     juveniles.

     _=Records in the Literature.=_--USNM 113228, referred to
     above as _Trionyx m. muticus_ is listed by Stejneger
     (1944:56) as _Amyda s. spinifera_; four of the specimens
     listed above (USNM 7655, 92605, 95133-34) are recorded by
     Stejneger (_op. cit._:23-34) as _Amyda mutica_. Cook
     (1946:185) records seven specimens of the _muticus_ group
     from Mississippi as follows: 1, no data; 1, Vicksburg,
     Warren Co.; 3, Forrest Co.; 1, Crawford Bridge, Jones Co.;
     1, Lake Park, Columbus, Lowndes Co. I have not seen these
     specimens; they are plotted on the distribution map--the
     one from Vicksburg as _muticus_ and the others as _calvatus_
     on geographic grounds. The hatchlings of _Trionyx muticus_
     referred to by Anderson (_loc. cit._) include the nine
     paratypes from Varnado, Louisiana.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
