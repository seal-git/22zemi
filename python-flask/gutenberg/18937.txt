THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.


Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. This
shoe stood near a great forest, and was so large that it served as a
house for the Old Lady and all her children, of which she had so many
that she did not know what to do with them.

[Illustration: Old Woman with children and Shoe.]

But the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children, and they only
thought of the best way to please her. Strong-arm, the eldest, cut
down trees for firewood. Peter made baskets of wicker-work. Mark was
chief gardener. Lizzie milked the cow, and Jenny taught the younger
children to read.

Now this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe. She and
her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy, and her
husband was a wood-cutter, like Strong-arm. But there lived in a huge
castle beyond the forest, a fierce giant, who one day came and laid
their house in ruins with his club; after which he carried off the
poor wood-cutter to his castle beyond the forest. When the Little Old
Woman came home, her house was in ruins and her husband was no where
to be seen.

[Illustration: Giant holding Wood-cutter.]

Night came on, and as the father did not return, the Old Lady and her
family went to search for him. When they came to that part of the
wood where the Giant had met their father, they saw an immense shoe.
They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father, but
met with no reply. Then the Old Lady thought that they had better
take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house. So Peter
and Strong-arm put a roof to it, and cut a door, and turned it into a
dwelling. Here they all lived happily for many years, but the Little
Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate. Strong-arm, who
saw how wretched his mother often was about it, proposed to the next
eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father
free from the Giant. Their mother knew the Giant's strength, and
would not hear of the attempt, as she feared they would be killed.
But Strong-arm was not afraid. He bought a dozen sharp swords, and
Peter made as many strong shields and helmets, as well as cross-bows
and iron-headed arrows. They were now quite ready; Strong-arm gave
the order to march, and they started for the forest. The next day
they came in sight of the Giant's Castle. Strong-arm, leaving his
brothers in a wood close by, strode boldly up to the entrance, and
seized the knocker. The door was opened by a funny little boy with a
large head, who kept grinning and laughing.

[Illustration: Strong-arm and Boy with Large Head.]

Strong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard, and presently
met a page, who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted.
Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father, who was kept a
prisoner by the Giant; on this the little man said he was sorry for
him, because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was
guarded by a large dragon. Strong-arm, nothing daunted, soon found
the monster, who was fast asleep, so he made short work of him by
sending his sword right through his heart; at which he jumped up,
uttering a loud scream, and made as if he would spring forward and
seize Strong-arm; but the good sword had done its work, and the
monster fell heavily on the ground, dead.

[Illustration: Strong-arm killing Dragon.]

Now the Giant, who had been drinking much wine, was fast asleep in a
remote part of the castle. Strong-arm had no sooner finished the
Dragon, than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door.
He led Strong-arm round to another part of the court-yard, where he
saw his poor father, who at once sprung to his feet, and embraced
him. Then Strong-arm called up his brothers, and when they had
embraced their father, they soon broke his chain and set him
free.

We must now return to the Little Old Woman. After her sons had
started she gave way to the most bitter grief. While she was in this
state, an old witch came up to her, and said she would help her, as
she hated the Giant, and wished to kill him. The Old Witch then took
the little Old Lady on her broom, and they sailed off through the
air, straight to the Giant's castle.

[Illustration: Witch and Lady on broom.]

Now this old Witch had great power, and at once afflicted the Giant
with corns and tender feet. When he awoke from his sleep he was in
such pain that he could bear it no longer, so he thought he would go
in search of his missing shoe, which, like the other one he had in
his castle, was easy and large for his foot. When he came to the
spot where the Old Lady and her children lived, he saw his old shoe,
and with a laugh that shook the trees, he thrust his foot into it,
breaking through the roof that Strong-arm and Peter had put to it.
The children, in great alarm, rushed about inside the shoe, and
frightened and trembling, scrambled through the door and the slits
which the Giant had formerly made for his corns. By this time the
witch and the Little Old Lady, as also Strong-arm, his eleven
brother and his father, were come up to the spot. Strong-arm and his
brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded, when
Strong-arm went up to him and cut off his head. Then the father and
the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house, and
lived happily ever afterwards.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD.


A gentleman of good account
  In Norfolk dwelt of late,
Whose wealth and riches did surmount
  Most men of his estate.

Sore sick he was, and like to die,
  No help his life could save;
His wife by him as sick did lie,
  And both were near the grave.

No love between these two was lost:
  Each to the other kind;
In love they lived, in love they died,
  And left two babes behind.

Now if the children chanced to die,
  Ere they to age should come,
Their uncle should possess their wealth:
  For so the will did run.

"Now brother," said the dying man,
  "Look to my children dear;
Be good unto my boy and girl,
  No friend else have they here."

[Illustration: Babes and Uncle at death-bed.]

Their parents being dead and gone,
  The children home he takes,
And brings them both unto his house,
  Where much of them he makes.

He had not kept these pretty babes
  A twelvemonth and a day,
When, for their wealth, he did devise
  To make them both away.

He bargain'd with two ruffians bold,
  Who were of savage mood,
That they should take the children twain,
  And slay them in a wood.

They prate and prattle pleasantly
  While riding on the way,
To those their wicked uncle hired,
  These lovely babes to slay:

[Illustration: Babes and Ruffians on horse-back.]

So that the pretty speech they had,
  Made the ruffians' heart relent;
And they that took the deed to do,
  Full sorely did repent.

Yet one of them, more hard of heart,
  Did vow to do his charge,
Because the wretch that hired him
  Had paid him very large.

The other would not agree thereto,
  So here they fell at strife;
With one another they did fight,
  About the children's life:

And he that was of milder mood,
  Did slay the other there,
Within an unfrequented wood;
  The babes did quake for fear!

[Illustration: Ruffian being killed.]

He took the children by the hand,
  While they for bread complain:
"Stay here," said he, "I'll bring ye bread,
  When I do come again."

These pretty babes, with hand in hand,
  Went wandering up and down;
But never more they saw the man,
  Approaching from the town:

[Illustration: Babes wandering.]

Thus wander'd these two pretty dears,
  Till death did end their grief;
In one another's arms they died,
  Poor babes, past all relief:

No burial these innocents
  Of any man receives,
But robin red-breast lovingly
  Did cover them with leaves.

[Illustration: Robin covering Babes with leaves.]

The fellow that did take in hand
  These children for to kill,
Was for a robbery judged to die,
  As was God's blessed will:

And did confess the very truth,
  The which is here express'd;
Their uncle died while he for debt
  Did long in prison rest.

[Illustration: Uncle in prison.]



LITTLE BO-PEEP.


  "Little Bo-Peep she lost her sheep
    And didn't know where to find them.
  Let them alone, and they'll come home,
    And bring their tails behind them!"

[Illustration: Bo-peep searching.]

So runs the Nursery Rhyme. Little Bo-Peep was a very nice little
girl. Her cheeks had a bloom on them like a lovely peach, and her
voice sounded like a sweet silver bell.

But though Little Bo-Peep was as good as she was beautiful, she
sometimes met with misfortunes that made her very sad. Once, when she
lost her sheep, she was very doleful indeed. And this is how it
happened.

One summer evening, when the sun was setting, Little Bo-Peep, who had
to rise very early in the morning, felt tired, and sat down on a bank
covered with daisies. Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep. Now
the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was a most stupid and stubborn
fellow. I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow
the Bell-wether, and that he always wears a bell round his neck. It
was a great pity, but the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was very
wild, and was much given to wander far away into the wood, where of
course the rest of the sheep would follow him.

Finding Little Bo-Peep asleep, the tiresome fellow began by standing
on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on
the grass. After this he whirled himself round like a top, shaking
his head all the time, and ringing his bell.

[Illustration: Bo-Peep asleep; Bell-wether capering.]

Very soon the rest of the flock began to dance and caper too. And
when they had wheeled round their leader for a time, they ran off
after him with a bound into the wood. Away they went, till they were
quite tired out; and then they came to a stand-still, staring at their
leader with very blank faces. But the Bell-wether looked foolish
enough now, and did nothing but shake his head slowly and ring his
bell, which seemed to say quite clearly, "You are lost, you are
lost!"

When Little Bo-Peep awoke she found her sheep gone, and hardly
knowing what she did, she walked on and on, far into the wood. She
met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands, and asked them if
they had seen her sheep. But they only laughed at her, and said, No.
One man was very cross, and threatened to beat her. At last she came
to a stile, on which an old Raven was perched. He looked so wise that
Little Bo-Peep asked him whether he had seen a flock of sheep. But he
only cried "Caw, caw, caw;" so Bo-Peep ran on again across the
fields.

[Illustration: Bo-peep and Raven.]

She wandered on till night-fall, and being faint with hunger, was
very glad to see a light just before her. As she went on, she saw
that it shone from a cottage window. But when she came to the door,
it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in, and was
just going to run away, when a cross-looking old woman came out, and
dragged her into the cottage. She made her sit by the side of her
son, who was a very ugly youth with a great red face and red
hair.

[Illustration: Bo-peep and ugly Youth.]

The old woman told him that she had brought Bo-Peep to be his wife,
so Bo-Peep, who did not like him at all, ran away while they were
asleep. But she did not know where to go, and gave herself up for
lost, when she heard something cry, "tu-whit--tu-whoo," in the
tree above her. It was a great owl, which began flapping its wings
with joy. Bo-Peep was frightened at first, but as the owl seemed very
kind, she followed it. It took her to a cottage were there was plenty
to eat and drink, and then, to Bo-Peep's great surprise, it began to
speak, and told her this story:--

"Know, dear Maiden," said the owl, "that I am the daughter of a King,
and was a lovely Princess; but I was changed into an owl by the old
woman at the cottage, because I would not marry her ugly son. But I
have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden, who would
come into this wood to find her lost sheep, should be the means of my
gaining my own form again. You are that pretty maid, and I will take
you to a spot where you will find your sheep, but without their
tails. The elves will play with them for this night, but in the
morning every sheep will have its tail again, except the stupid
Bell-wether. You must then wave his tail three times over my head,
and I shall resume my shape again."

The owl flew off, and led Bo-Peep into the wood, and said, "Sleep,
maiden, I will watch." How long she was asleep she could not tell,
but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up, and she saw the Queen
of the Fairies seated on a bank. The Queen said the sheep should be
punished for running away. She then saw all her sheep come trooping
into the place, and on every sheep there was an Elf, who held in his
hand a sheep's tail.

[Illustration: Sheep and Elves.]

After riding them about for some time, and having great fun with
them, the mad sport ceased, and each Elf restored the tail to his
sheep--all but the Bell-wether's, which their leader hid in a
tree. When Bo-Peep awoke, she saw the owl flapping its wings as if
to remind her of her promise; so she fetched the tail, and waved it
three times over its head, when up started the most charming Princess
that ever was seen. The princess gave Bo-Peep a beautiful cottage,
and her sheep never ran away from their kind mistress again.

THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.


[Illustration: Little Pig going to market.]

The Little Pig who Went to Market.

There was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their
mother, loved them all very dearly. Some of these little pigs were
very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her. The eldest
pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig. One day he
went to market with his cart full of vegetables, but Rusty, the
donkey, began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on
the road. All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move. So
Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts, and being very strong, drew the
cart to market himself. When he got there, all the other pigs began
to laugh. But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them
all his struggles on the road. Mr. Pig lost no time in selling
his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the
market-place, and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the
cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay. When he got there, he
told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy
son.

[Illustration: Little Pig with mother.]

The Little Pig who Stayed at Home.

This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he
was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother
made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she
went out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was
alone, instead of learning his lessons, he began to tease the poor
cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as
to see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out,
he began to cry. After this he broke all his brother's toys; he
forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the
kite, and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the
cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by
the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep. No sooner had
she done so, than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and
tied her in her chair. But soon she awoke and found out all the
mischief that he had been doing. She saw at once the damage that he
had done to his brother's playthings. So she quickly brought out her
thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a
beating as he did not forget for a long time.

[Illustration: Little Pig tying mother to chair.]

[Illustration: Little Pig in Dunce cap.]

The Little Pig who had Roast Beef.

This little pig was a very good and careful fellow. He gave his
mother scarcely any trouble, and always took a pleasure in doing all
she bade him. Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and
face, to some nice roast beef, while his brother, the idle pig, who
is standing on a stool in the corner, with the dunce's cap on, has
none. He sat down and quietly learned his lesson, and asked his
mother to hear him repeat it. And this he did so well that Mrs. Pig
stroked him on the ears and forehead, and called him a good little
pig. After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea.
He brought everything she wanted, and lifted off the kettle from
the fire, without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet.
By-and-bye he went out, after asking his mother's leave, to play with
his hoop. He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig, who, with
his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog; so he put his
hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor
old pig. It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother
often gave this little pig roast beef. We now come to the little pig
who had none.

[Illustration: Little Pig eating roast beef.]

The Little Pig who had None.

This was a most obstinate and wilful little pig. His mother had set
him to learn his lesson, but no sooner had she gone out into the
garden, than he tore his book into pieces. When his mother came back
he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like
himself. After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a
sound thrashing. Being afraid to go home, he stayed out till it was
quite dark and caught a severe cold. So he was taken home and put to
bed, and had to take a lot of nasty physic.

[Illustration: Little Pig running home.]

The Little Pig who Cried "Wee, wee," all the Way Home.

This little pig went fishing. Now he had been told not to go into
Farmer Grumpey's grounds, who did not allow any one to fish in his
part of the river. But in spite of what he had been told, this
foolish little pig went there. He soon caught a very large fish, and
while he was trying to carry it home, Farmer Grumpey came running
along with his great whip. He quickly dropped the fish, but the
farmer caught him, and as he laid his whip over his back for some
time, the little pig ran off, crying, "Wee, wee, wee," all the way
home.



THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.


[Illustration: Mother Goose and family.]

Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a
very good lad, and although he was not handsome, he was good-tempered
and industrious, and this made him better-looking than half the other
boys. Old Mother Goose carried a long stick, she wore a high-crowned
hat, and high-heeled shoes, and her kerchief was as white as snow.
Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond, and the Owl that sat
on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. But what a
fine strong fellow the Gander was! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted
to take a journey, she would mount upon his broad strong back, and
away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance.

[Illustration: Mother Goose and Gander flying.]

Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely;
so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could
find. It was early in the morning when he started, and his way lay
through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers; so on he went, with his
Mother's great clothes-prop over his shoulder. The fresh morning air
caused Jack's spirits to rise. He left the road, and plunged into the
thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his
clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made
many attempts to find the path again, he heard a scream. He jumped up
and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an
opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a
ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his
staff Jack sent the thief howling away, and then went back to the
young lady, who was lying on the ground, crying.

[Illustration: Jack and young lady.]

She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off,
and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was
the daughter of the Squire, who lived in the great white house on the
hill-top. She knew the path out of the wood quite well, and when they
reached the border, she said that Jack must come soon to her father's
house, so that he might thank him for his noble conduct.

When Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the
market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose,
for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left.
But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the
road, made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be
carried; and then, when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a
short time, she tried to fly away; so Jack seized her in his arms and
kept her there till he reached home.

[Illustration: Jack carrying Goose.]

Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird
Jack had bought; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe.
And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would
often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had
rescued in the forest, and soon began to sigh all day long. He
neglected the garden, cared no more for the Gander, and scarcely even
noticed the beautiful Goose. But one morning, as he was walking by
the pond, he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise,
as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was
surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to
his mother, who said, "Go to market, my son; sell your egg, and you
will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire." So to market
Jack went, and sold his golden egg; but the rogue who bought it of
him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his
finest clothes, and went up to the Squire's house. Two footmen stood
at the door, one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy
and stupid.

[Illustration: Jack and Footmen.]

When Jack asked to see the Squire, they laughed at him, and made
sport of his fine clothes; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each
a guinea, when they at once showed him to the Squire's room.

Now the Squire, who was very rich, was also very proud and fat, and
scarcely turned his head to notice Jack; but when he showed him his
bag of gold, and asked for his daughter to be his bride, the Squire
flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the
horse-pond. But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and
active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to
release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever,
and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did
his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she
would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer
sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated
him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself.
His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at
length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law. Then Old Mother
Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander,
leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride, who lived
happily ever afterwards.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
