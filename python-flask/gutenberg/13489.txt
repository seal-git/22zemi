THE GOTHIC PALACES OF VENICE.


The location of Venice upon a group of islands, sufficiently removed
from the mainland to make it impossible to effectually attack it from
this side, and naturally defended on the side towards the sea by a
long chain of low islands, separated by shallow inlets and winding
channels, making it difficult to approach, has rendered the city
peculiarly free from the disturbing influences which were constantly
at work in the neighboring cities of Italy during the Middle Ages.
While her neighbors were building strong encircling walls, each
individual house a fortress in itself, Venice rested secure in her
natural defences and built her palaces open down to the water's
edge, with no attempt at fortification. Her hardy and adventurous
inhabitants rapidly extended their trade to all quarters of the world
and accumulated vast wealth, which was freely lavished on public and
private buildings. The magnificence of the former was only equalled in
the days of ancient Rome, and it is doubtful if the latter have ever
been surpassed in sumptuousness and splendor. The palaces of Venice
form an architectural group of great interest, in many respects quite
distinct from the contemporary buildings on the mainland. They were
carefully planned to satisfy the demands for comfort and convenience
as well as display. Most of them have the same arrangement of plan,
and were commonly built of two lofty and two low stories. On the
ground floor, or water level, is a hall running back from the gate to
a bit of garden at the other side of the palace, and on either side
of this hall, which was hung with the family trophies of the chase and
war, are the porter's lodge and gondoliers' rooms. On the first and
second stories are the family apartments, opening on either side from
great halls, of the same extent as that below, but with loftier roofs,
of heavy rafters gilded or painted. The fourth floor is of the same
arrangement, but has a lower roof, and was devoted to the better class
of servants. Of the two stories used by the family, the third is the
loftier and airier, and was occupied in summer; the second was
the winter apartment. On either hand the rooms open in suites.
The courtyard at the rear usually had a well in its centre with an
ornamental curb; and access to the upper floors of the house was
gained by an exterior staircase in the court, which was often
elaborately enriched with carved ornament.

The materials used in construction are mostly red and white marbles,
used with a fine color sense, and the desire for abundance of color
was frequently further gratified by painting the exterior walls with
elaborate pictorial decorations.

[Illustration: II. The Palazzo Contarini Fasan, Venice.]

The earliest palaces are Byzantine, but with the growth of the Gothic
movement these were gradually superseded, although the Gothic
influence worked more slowly here than on the mainland. The richest
and most elaborate work was built at this period. Finally the
Renaissance took the place of Gothic; and the later palaces, built in
this style, show strongly the debased condition into which the art of
Venice fell in the Dark Ages.

We have selected for the illustrations of this number of the BROCHURE
SERIES some of the most widely known examples of the fifteenth-century
Gothic palaces, built at the time when Venice was at the zenith of
prosperity as the principal commercial power of the world.




I.

SOUTHWEST ANGLE OF THE DUCAL PALACE, VENICE.


Although the Ducal Palace is much larger than the other palaces of
Venice, and intended for general civic uses as well as a residence for
the Duke or Doge, it follows closely the type already described. It
has undergone so many changes since its first foundation in about the
year 800 (813 according to Ruskin), having been destroyed five times,
and as often re-erected in grander style, besides having been added to
and the dilapidated portions restored, that it is impossible to assign
a comprehensive date to cover the building of the present structure.
In fact, the earliest portion was gradually added to, carrying it
further and further around the quadrangle until it reached the point
of beginning, when this process was repeated, partially replacing
the older Byzantine work with Gothic and then with Renaissance, the
present building still having examples of all three styles.

The portion shown in our illustration is said to have been erected
between the years 1424 and 1442, by Giovanni Buon and his sons
Pantaleone and Bartolommeo Buon the elder; although Mr. Ruskin states
that in 1423 the Grand Council sat in the Great Council Chamber for
the first time, and in that year the Gothic Ducal Palace of Venice was
completed.

This angle, which faces the Piazetta and the Riva, is called by
Mr. Ruskin the "Fig-Tree Angle," because of the group of sculpture
representing the fall of man. The figure above the angle capital of
the upper arcade is that of Gabriel. The richly decorated capitals of
the lower arcade represent personifications of the Virtues and Vices,
the favorite subjects of decorative art, at this period, in all the
cities of Italy. The capitals of the upper arcade, no two of which are
alike, are also richly wrought with figure sculpture, the one on the
angle containing representations of the four winds.

The arrangement of the tracery above the upper arcade is worthy of
note as the placing of the quatrefoils between the arches, which
is characteristic of earlier examples, is more reasonable, from a
constructive point of view, than the later practice of placing them
above the centres of the arches.

The use of the rope moulding as a decorative finish for the angle of a
building is also characteristic of the palace architecture of Venice,
and may here be seen most effectively applied.




II.

THE PALAZZO CONTARINI FASAN, VENICE.


This is one of the most notable examples of domestic Gothic
architecture in Venice, and dates from the fifteenth century. Ruskin
refers to it as follows: "In one respect, however, it deserves to be
regarded with attention, as showing how much beauty and dignity may
be bestowed on a very small and unimportant dwelling-house by Gothic
sculpture. Foolish criticisms upon it have appeared in English
accounts of foreign buildings, objecting to it on the ground of its
being 'ill proportioned'; the simple fact being that there was no room
in this part of the canal for a wider house, and that its builder made
its rooms as comfortable as he could, and its windows and balconies of
a convenient size for those who were to see through them and stand on
them, and left the 'proportions' outside to take care of themselves,
which, indeed, they have very sufficiently done; for though the house
thus honestly confesses its diminutiveness, it is nevertheless one of
the principal ornaments of the very noblest reach of the Grand Canal,
and would be nearly as great a loss if it were destroyed, as the
church of La Salute itself."

This building is popularly known as "Desdemona's House."




III.

THE PALAZZO CAVALLI, VENICE.


This palace, situated opposite the Academy of Arts on the Grand Canal,
also dates from the fifteenth century. Its balconies and tracery are
of the later Gothic period, showing marked tendencies towards the
Renaissance.

It has been recently restored by its present owner, Baron Franchetti,
and is frequently spoken of as the Palazzo Franchetti.




IV.

WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CAVALLI.


In Venetian tracery it will always be found that a certain arrangement
of quatrefoils and other figures has been planned as if it were to
extend indefinitely into miles of arcade, and out of this colossal
piece of marble lace a portion in the shape of a window is cut
mercilessly and fearlessly: what fragments and odd shapes of
interstice, remnants of this or that figure of the divided foliation,
may occur at the edge of the window, it matters not; all are cut
across and shut in by the great outer archivolt. This is of course
open to serious criticism as construction, but its beauty and
effectiveness, as used here, cannot be gainsaid.




V.

WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CICOGNA, VENICE.


This is an example of early Gothic work in Venice and is quite unlike
later examples. Ruskin speaks of it as the only instance of good
_complicated_ tracery to be found in Venice. The fact that it is
moulded only on the face is considered evidence of its early date.

In this view, as, in fact, in all of the examples which we have
selected, the moulding formed of alternating blocks or dentils,
projecting first on one side and then the other, which is peculiar to
Venice, can be seen. It was commonly used as a frame about a window or
group of windows, and is very effective, especially when used, as it
frequently was, relieved against a flat wall surface.




VI. and VII.

TWO PORTIONS OF THE FACADE OF THE CA D'ORO, VENICE.


This, next to the Ducal Palace, is the most elaborate and it might be
said the most beautiful of the Gothic Venetian palaces. It has been
considerably changed in the various restorations to which it has been
subjected, but still has enough of its original features to remain
a wonderfully beautiful building. It is an extreme example of the
characteristic disregard of the ordinary principles of building
construction to be found throughout the work we have been considering.
Fergusson's remarks upon this failing of the Venetian architects is
pointed and well considered. He says: "Most of the faults that strike
us in the buildings of Venice arise from the defective knowledge which
they betray of constructive principles. The Venetian architects had
not been brought up in the hard school of practical experience, nor
thoroughly grounded in construction, as the northern architects were
by the necessities of the large buildings which they erected. On the
contrary, they merely adopted details because they were pretty,
and used them so as to be picturesque in domestic edifices where
convenience was everything, and construction but a secondary
consideration."

The Cà D'oro was probably built about the middle of the fourteenth
century.

Evidences of the use of color in this façade can be plainly seen in
the photographic views, and the contrast of the deep shadows and flat
wall surfaces is strikingly beautiful.




VIII.

THE PALAZZO PISANI.


This palace is of the late Gothic period, nearly approaching the
Renaissance. It is situated on the lower reach of the Grand Canal.

In all of the examples here selected a marked predominance of
horizontal treatment will be observed. The roofs are flat, and arcades
and balconies all help to emphasize the horizontal direction in the
design. This, it will be observed, is distinctly different from the
contemporary Gothic of the rest of Europe.

       *       *       *       *       *

Notable examples of American buildings modelled after or in the style
of the Venetian palaces are the Chicago Athletic Club, the Montauk
Club, Brooklyn, and the new building adjoining the Hoffman House,
Madison Square, New York.

A well-selected collection of foreign photographs has come to be as
necessary and invariable a feature in a well-equipped architect's
office as good drawing instruments or as Vignola's treatise on the
Roman Orders. But unfortunately a really satisfactory collection of
photographs is seldom within the reach of more than a small proportion
of the architects who could use them to advantage. This is partly on
account of the expense of a good collection, as photographs can hardly
be bought for less than twenty-five cents each, and partly on account
of the difficulty of finding a desirable stock from which to make
selections on this side of the Atlantic. Nearly all of the most
valuable collections have been gathered together abroad by the owners
and are the result of gradual accumulation, probably extending over
years of travel, and representing no small investment of money.

Such a collection, it is needless to say, is not within the grasp of
the young and struggling draughtsman, but he, of all others, would
profit most by possession and use of such a treasure if it could be
placed in his hands. It would help to form and direct his tastes,
making him familiar with the masterpieces of the past, and would
furnish a basis for comparison of the current work about him.

Of course a draughtsman in any of the larger offices will have certain
opportunities to study and work from the collection in the office
library. This is a valuable privilege, but it is only open to a few
out of the many draughtsmen in the country, and is not to be compared
in its resulting benefits to the actual possession of even a very much
smaller collection.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is the purpose of the BROCHURE SERIES to place in the hands
of draughtsmen a most carefully selected series of photographic
reproductions, chosen both for their educational value and their
usefulness as practical reference material for everyday work. This can
be done at one fiftieth the cost of ordinary photographs, and thus be
easily within the reach of any draughtsman.

No attempt will be made to follow any systematic arrangement of the
subjects presented, although it will be frequently found advisable,
as in the present issue, to group a number of subjects of more or
less related character. The main result to be sought for is the
presentation of the greatest amount of the most valuable material in
the most available shape, and at the least cost. The possibility of
realizing this ambitious purpose remains to be demonstrated. It need
only be said that this initial number is put forward as an earnest of
the work to follow.

       *       *       *       *       *

A most important feature in recent educational work as applied to
architecture is to be found in the formation of a number of classes,
or _ateliers_ as they are called, modelled in the main after those in
Paris. They are all formed with the purpose of furnishing instruction
in those elements of academic design which are unattainable in the
routine experience of office practice. The details of arrangement for
accomplishing this purpose vary somewhat in the different _ateliers_.
We believe the first to be started was the one connected with the
office of Messrs. Carrère & Hastings in New York. Here a limited
number of students, both young men and young women, are received, and
as a return for the instruction given them are expected to render such
assistance in the regular work of the draughting-room as they can.
This service is exactly similar to the "niggering," as it is called,
required by long-established custom of the younger men at the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts at Paris, which is one of the most valuable features of
the school work. In Paris by this method the younger students have an
opportunity to come in personal and intimate contact with those more
advanced, and have the benefit of working on larger and more important
work than they are capable of undertaking unaided. In the new
_atelier_ a problem in design is given to the class, thus more than
ordinarily equipped for the work before him.

His work while abroad was systematic, well directed, and untiring, and
no one of the succeeding scholars has labored to better advantage or
accomplished more than he, although each in turn has had the example
and experience of his predecessors as a guide and stimulus to
increased endeavor. Mr. Blackall's time was devoted largely to travel,
together with the sketching and measuring of important work.

Since his return he has built up a successful and varied practice.

As an active member of the Boston Society of Architects and the
first president of the Boston Architectural Club, he has done much to
advance the best interests of the profession, both within its ranks
and in its relations to the public. To nothing so much as to his
faithful labors can the success of the Architectural Club be laid. He
has made it the largest and most effective organization of its kind
in the country, and the draughtsmen of Boston have every reason to be
thankful to him for his unselfish devotion to their interests.

He has, for several years, been the permanent chairman of the
Committee of the Boston Society of Architects, appointed to administer
the Rotch Scholarship, and through his earnest work the opportunities
open to its holders are being constantly increased.

Club Notes.


The youngest of the architectural societies of the country is the
Cleveland Architectural Club. It was organized in November last with a
membership of fifteen, which number has been rapidly growing and bids
fair to grow much further. In this instance, as has been the case in
all the other large cities where similar clubs have been formed, it
is the better class of draughtsmen who have felt the need of an
organization that would bring them together socially, and give an
opportunity for organized study and mutual improvement; and it is a
most encouraging symptom of the generally diseased condition of the
public mind in relation to architecture that these clubs have become
so numerous in the last few years. Aside from the direct influence
upon its own membership, the manifestation of a progressive and
aggressive spirit cannot help provoking curiosity and discussion
outside, if it accomplishes nothing further. It is somewhat surprising
that with the unusually active interest which Cleveland has always
evinced in matters relating to art, such a movement has not been
started before. We shall have occasion before long to refer more in
detail to this new and flourishing society.

The Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects announces
the second annual competition for a gold medal, to be open to members
of the Chicago Architectural Club who are not practicising architects
of over two years' standing. The problem is the design for a memorial
building for the study of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, and is to
be finished on April 29.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Chicago Architectural Club mingles work and play in a thoroughly
Bohemian fashion. A recent invitation card bid its members to attend a
"Rip-Snorter at the Club House," stating that "provisions and provisos
would be provided and Frou Frous be on tap." The exact significance
of this cabalistic description is known only to the members and their
guests. The same card announced that the new Constitution and By-Laws
would be finally voted upon at the same meeting, and further announced
the conditions of a forthcoming sketch competition. Things move
rapidly in Chicago.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Chicago Architectural Club will hold its eighth annual exhibition
of works of architecture and the allied arts at the Art Institute

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
