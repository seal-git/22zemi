THE GREAT WAR.


In reviewing the events of the last week throughout the world-wide area of
war, let  us begin with the  Dark Continent, where everything  went in our
favour--very brilliantly  so. First of  all, then, we  may now be  said to
have  completed our  conquest of  the  German Cameroon  country by  taking
possession of the whole of the railway which runs northward from Bonabari,
and is now in  the hands of our troops. A similar fate  is reserved, at no
distant date, for German South  Africa, against which General Botha--a man
no less brave  and dashing as a soldier than  sagacious as a statesman--is
preparing to  lead a  conquering force. Having  stamped out  the rebellion
within the  Union itself--crushing it  literally like a beetle--he  is now
addressing himself to  the task--a harder one, perhaps,  but still certain
of achievement--of making  an end of the bad neighbourhood  of the Germans
in  the vast  region  forming the  Hinterland of  Lüderitz  Bay, which  is
already in  our possession, and  rendering it  impossible for them  in the
future to  intrigue from that quarter  against the peace and  stability of
the  Union. The  court-martialling  and prompt  execution  at Pretoria  of
the  rebel leader,  Captain Fourie,  shows  what the  Union Government  is
minded  to do  _pour décourager  les autres_.  The rebellion  was promptly
and  energetically suppressed--though  not without  a Union  loss of  334,
including  more  than  100  deaths;  while in  German  South  Africa,  the
casualties had also risen to a total of some 370. The rebels had more than
170 killed,  over 300 wounded, and  5500 prisoners--which was thus  a very
creditable bit of  work, as brilliant as it was  brief, in the rounding-up
of rebels against the unity of the Empire.

[Illustration: SPOKESMAN OF FRENCH DETERMINATION: M. VIVIANI, PREMIER OF
FRANCE.

Allies is won.--[_Photo. Topical._]]

Admiral Sir George Callaghan was Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet from
1911  till the  war began.  He has  since  been on  the War  Staff at  the
Admiralty.--[_Photo. Heath._]]

Quite  of a  piece with  the doing  of this  job in  South Africa  was the
disposal  of  another overt  enemy  against  our  authority at  the  other
extremity of the Dark Continent--in the  person of the Khedive, Abbas II.,
who has  now been replaced  by Prince Hussein  Kamel Pasha as  the nominal
Sultan of Egypt--under our protection and power. No change of the kind was
ever  brought about  with so  much  statesmanlike wisdom  and such  little
friction,  or with  so much  hearty  approval from  all sides--except,  of
course, that of the Turks and their German backers, for whom the change of
regime,  effected as  it  was by  a  simple stroke  of  Sir Edward  Grey's
masterly pen,  was a most painful  slap. The exchange of  messages between
King  George  and Prince  Hussein--one  promising  unfailing support,  and
the  other unfailing  allegiance--completed  the transaction,  one of  the
greatest triumphs of British statesmanship, compared with which the recent
statecraft of the Germans is mere  amateur bungling. Marshal von der Goltz
Pasha, who has now exchanged his  Governorship of Belgium for the position
of chief  military counsellor on the  Bosphorus, will find it  harder than
ever--with  his rabble  army under  Djemal Pasha--to  "liberate" from  the
British yoke the people of Egypt, who have already shown that they no more
yearn for  such emancipation than  our loyal fellow-subjects in  India. At
Constantinople  it  was given  out  that  the  _Messudiyeh_, sunk  by  one

Christmas celebrations in the Navy were naturally curtailed this year, but
even in  time of war  the festival is observed  to some extent,  under the
limitations caused by  the necessity of being ready  for immediate action.
That the Navy  did not allow Christmas festivities to  interfere with duty
is shown by  the brilliant air-raid on Cuxhaven on  Christmas morning. The
Grand  Fleet which  keeps  its silent  watch on  the  seas, under  Admiral
Jellicoe, did not, we may be sure,  relax any of its vigilance. One of the
Christmas customs  in the Navy  is to  decorate the mastheads  with holly,
mistletoe, or evergreens. The mess-room tables are also decorated, and the
officers walk in  procession through the messes, the  Captain sampling the
fare.--[_Photos. by Newspaper Illustrations and Alfieri._]

of our  submarines in  the Dardanelles,  had simply been  the victim  of a
"leak"; but  so serious was  this little "rift  within the lute"  that its
author,  Lieut.-Commander  Holbrook, R.N.,  was  awarded  a V.C.  for  his
splendid deed  of daring--a  very different  kind of  act from  the German
bombardment of undefended towns on our  East Coast, which caused our First
Lord of the Admiralty to write  to the Mayor of Scarborough--and his words
deserve  to  be here  repeated  and  recorded--that "nothing  proves  more
plainly the  effectiveness of  British naval pressure  than the  frenzy of
hatred aroused  against us in the  breasts of the enemy....  Their hate is
the measure of  their fear.... Whatever feats of arms  the German Navy may
hereafter  perform, the  stigma of  the baby-killers  of Scarborough  will
brand its officers and men while sailors sail the seas."

[Illustration: A GERMAN ISLAND ADDED TO THE EMPIRE BY THE AUSTRALIAN
FORCES: READING THE BRITISH PROCLAMATION AT RABAUL, NEU POMMERN.

The Australian Squadron arrived at Herbertshöhe, Neu Pommern, on September
11. After some fighting, the Germans surrendered, and, two days later, the
Union Jack was hoisted at Rabaul, the German capital. The proclamation was
read  by Major  Francis Heritage  (facing Colonel  W. Holmes,  the central
figure in the  photograph). For the benefit of the  natives an address was
given in  amusing "pidgin" English  (see the  "Times,"  November  16). Neu
Pommern (formerly New Britain) is just east of New Guinea.]

Other  attempts  at  "frightful  frightfulness"   on  the  part  of  these
"baby-killers"  were  a  couple  of aeroplane  raids--of  which  the  base
was  probably  Ostend--carried out  on  Christmas  Eve and  Christmas  Day
respectively--against Dover and Sheerness. It must be owned that they were
decidedly daring,  yet in the nature  of damp-squib affairs, as  it turned
out. In the case of Dover, the  bomb dropped was probably intended for the
Castle--a pretty conspicuous target, though all  it did was to disturb the
soil of  a cabbage-garden, and  excite the pursuit  of several of  our own
air-craft, which  lost their  seaward-soaring quarry  in the  fog brooding
over the Channel; while in the case of the Sheerness invader, on Christmas
Day, which made  its appearance just as the visitors  at Southend over the
water  were about  to sit  down to  their turkey  and plum-pudding--little
dreaming of  the extra  dish of enjoyment  which was thus  to be  added to
their menu--it was at once tackled, as at Dover, by some of our own airmen
and pelted  with shot, being hit  three or four times;  though this aerial
intruder also  managed, in  the mist, to  show a clean  pair of  heels, or
wings,  and make  off  eastward.  These were  the  German  replies to  our
bomb-dropping raids on Düsseldorf and Friedrichs-hafen, and intended to be
a foretaste of  what we may expect in the  shape of German "frightfulness"
as prompted by the "insensate hatred" referred to by Mr. Churchill.

Daring enough in themselves, those German visitations seemed insignificant
by  comparison  with  the  raids  which  were  being  carried  out  almost
simultaneously on the other  side of the sea by our  own naval airmen. For
while the German aeroplanist was helping to dig a cabbage garden at Dover,
one of  our Squadron-Commanders--R.B. Davies, R.N.--from  a Maurice-Farman
biplane  was  much more  profitably  engaged  in  dropping a  dozen  bombs
on  a  Zeppelin shed  at  Brussels--causing  "clouds  of smoke"  to  arise
therefrom--most probably from the flames of the incendiarised air-ship.

[Illustration: THE AIR-RAID ON GERMAN WAR-SHIPS OFF CUXHAVEN: BRITISH
SEA-PLANES, SISTERS TO THOSE WHICH TOOK PART IN THE BRILLIANT EXPLOIT.]

The sea-planes came  into great prominence, for the first  time during the
war, on Christmas Day, when seven  of them attacked German war-ships lying
in Schillig  Roads, off Cuxhaven. The  attack started from a  point in the
vicinity of Heligoland, and the air-craft were escorted by a light-cruiser
and destroyer force, together with submarines. The enemy put up a fight by
means  of two  Zeppelins,  three  or  four  bomb-dropping sea-planes,  and
several submarines.  Six out  of the  seven pilots  returned safely--three
were  re-embarked by  our  ships,  and three  were  picked  up by  British
submarines.  Flight-Commander Francis  E.T.  Hewlett,  R.N., was  reported
missing. In  our first  photograph a  sea-plane is  being conveyed  to her
parent  ship;  in the  second  and  third,  sea-planes are  being  hoisted
aboard.--[_Photos. by S. and G._]

But  that  was  nothing  to  the  Christmas  Day  feat  of  seven  of  our
sea-planes--one for  every day  of the  week--which, accompanied  by light
cruisers  and  destroyers, with  several  submarines,  made a  daring  and
unparalleled attack  on Cuxhaven, at  the mouth  of the Elbe,  and several
war-ships  lying at  anchor  there--unparalleled, by  reason  of the  fact
that  this was  the first  "combined  assault of  all arms"  known to  the
sea--namely, from  the air, the water,  and from under the  water. Both at
Yarmouth and Scarborough the German  bombarding cruisers were so nervously
afraid of  being caught in the  act that they  may almost be said  to have
only fired their guns and then run  away again. But our triple flotilla at
the mouth of the Elbe spent a deliberate three hours in the performance of
its task,  and then  calmly withdrew  with only one  of the  daring pilots
missing. So far,  it was the most  thrilling episode of the  war, and must
give our enemies "furiously to think," in addition to furnishing them with
much more  for the  nourishment of  their hate.  Of this  insensate hatred
against us  in the hearts  of the German  people--and all because  we have
"queered their  pitch," or  crossed their  long-cherished schemes  for the
destruction of  our Empire--the  most furious  exponent is  the _Kölnische
Zeitung_,  or  _Cologne  Gazette_,  as we  generally  call  it--which  may
be  described, on  the  whole,  as the  most  authoritative  organ of  the
Fatherland--or the _Times_  of Germany, but always with  a difference. The
curious anomaly is that the seat of this powerful journal should be so far
away  from  the capital--at  Cologne.  There  is  an old  story--known  to
tourists who read  their guide-books--about the "Three  Kings of Cologne,"
but now  this story has just  received a pendant which  gives anything but
satisfaction at Cologne itself or anywhere else in Germany.

This was the  recent meeting, not at  Cologne, but at Malmö,  of the three
Kings of Scandinavia--Denmark, Sweden, and Norway--who lunched, and dined,
and debated  together for several days,  when it was at  last announced to
the world at  large (and Germany in particular)  that "their deliberations
had not  only consolidated the  good relations between the  three Northern

Both the  French and British  troops have made the  best of things  in the
siege-warfare of the  trenches, and out of an initial  condition of misery
have managed to  evolve a considerable amount of comfort  in many parts of
the front. Ingenious French engineers,  for example, have constructed warm
shower-baths, hair-dressing  saloons, and similar conveniences,  while the
British "Eye-Witness"  was able to write  recently of our own  lines: "The
trenches themselves  are heated  by braziers and  stoves and  floored with
straw, bricks and  boards. Behind them are shelters and  dug-outs of every
description most  ingeniously contrived." The above  French cartoon, which
is  from "La  Vie Parisienne,"  is  headed "La  Guerre des  Taubes et  des
Taupes" (moles).

kingdoms,  but that  an agreement  had  also been  reached concerning  the
special  questions raised"--a  result which  must have  been anything  but
agreeable  to  the  War-Lord  of  Potsdam,  who  had  been  thirsting  for
_Weltmacht_, or world-dominion, and casting about to pave the way for this
result by absorbing the minor States  of Northern Europe--as a shark would
open its voracious jaws to swallow down a shoal of minnows, or other small
fry. That this was a prominent plank in the platform of German policy must
be clear to all  who have read the diplomatic revelations  of the last few
months; but  now the "Three Kings  of Scandinavia," going one  better than
their storied colleagues of Cologne, have shown that they are as obtuse to
the blandishments of Berlin as the journalists of New York and Chicago.

German air-craft have  lately been active in the  neighbourhood of Warsaw,
the great objective  of the German Eastern Armies. Our  photograph shows a

According to all accounts, the Allied position in the west, especially the
British section thereof, is  as "safe as the Bank of  England," to use the
words  of one  of  our officers  already quoted;  and  though the  Kaiser,
recovered from his illness, has again returned to the front--or, at least.
the distant rear of the front--he does not seem to have much refreshed the
offensive  spirit of  his armies.  Nevertheless, the  French _communiqués_
have suffered  from no great diminution  in the daily records  of sporadic
trench-fighting all along  the Allied line--fighting of  a fluctuating, if
on the whole  favourable, kind for the strategic plans  of General Joffre,
as to whom, one  German officer in Belgium said that he  wished to God his
country had such  a War Lord, seeing that, apart  from Marshal Hindenburg,
all their Generals were only worthy of disdain.

In  a telegram  to his  aunt,  the Dowager  Grand Duchess  of Baden,  only
daughter of the old Emperor William, the Kaiser gave "God alone the glory"
for a grand victory which was supposed to have been achieved by Hindenburg
over the  Russians in front  of Warsaw--a  victory which caused  Berlin to
burst out into bunting and braying  and comparisons to Salamis and Leipzig
in its  momentous results. But  this acknowledgment  of the Kaiser  to the
Lord  of  Hosts,  "our  old  ally of  Rossbach"--which  must  surely  have
inspired  Hindenburg himself  with  a  feeling of  jealousy  and sense  of
soreness--turned out to have been  altogether premature, and of the nature
of shouting before they were out of the wood.

For a  fortnight or so the  fighting in Poland  continued to be of  a very
confused kind, the telegrams from both sides being most contradictory, but
on  the whole  the  advantage  seemed to  remain  with  the Russians,  who
recorded their victories  in very striking figures of  killed and captured
during their  defence of several  rivers tributary  to the Vistula  on its
left bank. Hindenburg the redoubtable--the only  General worth a rap (or a
"damn," as  Wellington would have  said), according to the  German officer
already  quoted--promised to  let the  Kaiser have  Warsaw as  a Christmas
present; but,  according to all present  appearances, he is no  nearer the
capital of Russian Poland  than his comrade von Kluck (who  is now said to
have been superseded)  was to Paris on  the day of his  being tumbled back
from the Marne.

beautiful gardens and park, all that  remained at Christmas of the Château
of Vermelles  is the  shell here  shown. Fate made  the Château,  with the
small adjoining  village, for upwards  of eight weeks a  disputed tactical
point between the Germans and the Allies, a narrow strip of only 150 yards
of ground  intervening between  the trenches.  The Germans  held Vermelles
from  October 16  until  early  in December,  fortifying  the Château  and
grounds. They had  to be shelled out  By October 21, the  Château was only
smouldering walls, and French engineers were mining approaches to it. Then
an English  heavy battery  bombarded Vermelles. Finally  the French  "in a
very brilliant attack," stormed and took Vermelles, village and château.

[Illustration: "DRIVEN ASHORE AND BURNT": THE "EMDEN" BEACHED ON NORTH
KEELING ISLAND, AND A BOATLOAD OF PRISONERS COMING AWAY.]

An  officer  of H.M.A.S.  "Sydney,"  which  destroyed the  German  cruiser
"Emden"  off  the  Cocos  Islands  on   November  9,  has  given  a  vivid
account  of the  event  in  a private  letter  recently  published in  the
"Times."  After describing  the earlier  part  of the  action, he  writes:
"By  now  her  three  funnels  and   her  foremast  had  been  shot  away,
and  she  was on  fire  aft.  We turned  again,  and  after giving  her  a
salvo  or  two with  the  starboard  guns, saw  her  run  ashore on  North
Keeling  Island. So  at 11.20  a.m. we  ceased firing,  the action  having
lasted  one hour  forty  minutes." Later,  the writer  of  the letter  was
sent  in  a  cutter to  the  "Emden"  to  arrange  for the  surrender  and
taking  off the  wounded.  "From  the number  of  men we  rescued--_i.e._,
150,"  he  continues,   "we  have  been  able  to   reckon  their  losses.

German  landing-party, he  says: "Early  in the  morning we  made for  the
cable-station, to find that the party landed by the Germans to destroy the
station had seized a schooner and  departed. The poor devils aren't likely
to  go far  with a  leaking ship  and the  leathers removed  from all  the
pumps." It  may be  that the vessel  seen on the  right in  the right-hand

instruments at the Eastern Telegraph Cable Station, but those in charge of
it had a duplicate set concealed.--[_Photos. by Illustrations Bureau._]

The Japanese  troops landed  in Lao-shan  Bay on  September 18,  the small
British force on the 24th. On the  28th they carried the high ground 2-1/2
miles from the  main German position, and fire was  opened on the fortress
during the first week in October. The general bombardment began on October

One of the features of the present  war which have been drawn attention to
by "Eye-Witness"  in his letters from  the Front, is the  resuscitation of
fighting with hand-grenades on both  sides. Particularly has this been the
case  during the  battles in  Northern France  and Flanders,  wherever the
trenches approached one  another within flinging distance.  There also, on
occasion,  where the  troops facing  one another  were further  apart, and
beyond reach  of a throw  by hand, an  improvised catapult of  the classic
type has  been devised  by our  men for  slinging hand-bombs;  utilising a
metal spring  bent back and held  fast in a  notch, to be released  on the
lighting  of the  fuse.  An illustration  of a  catapult  appeared in  the
"Illustrated War News" of December 23.

the apparatus  for holding each grenade  in the hand is  clearly shown. In
the photograph  above the shells are  seen bursting at a  certain distance
from the firing-point. Our soldiers in the trenches in Flanders, according
to  "Eye-Witness,"  have  made improvised  hand-grenades  for  themselves,
utilising empty jam-tins. These are charged with gun-cotton and fused, and
on being  lighted are flung  across among  the Germans in  their trenches.
What  the jam-tin  hand-grenades  look like  the  "War News"  illustration

its forward  march to the  Suez Canal on the  21st. The Canal  is securely
held along its hundred miles of  length. Our illustration shows one of the
several  British  advanced-camps  on  the eastern  bank  (the  Asiatic  or
Sinaitic Peninsula  side), placed there  to prevent a surprise  attack. In
all  cases, our  positions are  well fortified,  and, with  the desert  in
front,  present a  formidable  barrier to  the enemy.  In  support of  the
entrenched camps, movable pontoon-bridges have been constructed at certain
points. These,  with the  permanent railway along  the western  bank, will
enable reinforcements to be thrown across the waterways speedily.]

days. The spirit of this romance of the Franco-German War of 1870-71 lives
in the picture by E.J. Delahaye. Chivalry  was not then dead, and the "Red
Prince," father  of our  popular Duchess  of Connaught,  although Juliette
Dodu had hindered the  German advance on Paris, shook her  by the hand and
said that it was "an honour to meet so brave a woman."

soldiers, it  is said, dropped  by the way  from fatigue and  weakness, as
they had had  neither food nor rest,  and several of the  officers did the
same. It  was impossible for some  parts of the  army to make a  stand, as

of  the horses.  Only  those of  the Austrian  regiments  which had  their
supply-wagons with them were able to reach the Bosnian frontier.

In  more ways  than one,  the  German soldier  would seem  on occasion  to
represent, as  it were,  a reverting  to primitive  type: to  the barbaric
European  of  centuries  back  in the  world's  history.  The  "reversion"
takes  many shapes,  and  we have  seen  instances of  it  during the  war
in  various ways.  It  is  surely readily  recognisable,  for example,  in
that  spirit  of  sheer   ruthlessness  which  inspired  the  perpetration
of  the  inhuman  outrages  that  have laid  Belgium  waste,  and  of  the
killing of  harmless women and  children by  naval shells at  the peaceful
watering-place  of  Scarborough.  Another   and  more  innocuous  form  of
going  back to  the  habits  and methods  typical  of  primitive man,  is,
perhaps,  traceable  in  the  illustrations given  above.  They  are  some
of  the handiwork  of  the twentieth-century  German  military cavemen  of

In very much the same way, as modern exploration has brought to light, the
primaeval cave-dwelling  inhabitants of  Europe in prehistoric  times left
rudimentary traces  of their presence  in certain  places in the  shape of
carvings and roughly  painted "portraits" of themselves,  of the creatures
they  hunted  for  food  and  fought with,  and  of  the  implements  they
used.  According to  the  German  newspaper from  which  we reproduce  the

There, with a hastily raised commando at his heels, he forcibly seized the
place and, after  submitting the local officials  to brutal ill-treatment,
in a wild, incendiary  speech called on the Dutch of  South Africa to rise
in arms  against the  British Government.  It was at  Winburg that  De Wet
performed,  as  it is  stated,  the  theatrical  and unworthy  outrage  of
trampling on and tearing the Union Jack. The identical flag which suffered
the maltreatment is shown in our photograph,  in the state in which it was

atonement  are  to  come,  as  we  shall  learn  when  De  Wet  faces  his

The entrenchment of the East Coast is  not only a wise precaution, but the
work of digging and fitting up  the trenches is excellent practice for the
troops who may later on be called  upon to do similar work abroad. It will
be  seen  from  our  photographs  that the  trenches  on  the  East  Coast
are  constructed on  the  latest pattern  as developed  in  the war,  with
deep passage-ways,  roofed sections,  traverses, and  zigzags to  avoid an
enfilading  fire  from the  flank.  They  are,  indeed,  to judge  by  the

[Illustration: CHRISTMAS WITH THE GERMAN ARMY, ACCORDING TO A GERMAN
PAPER; THE ARRIVAL FROM HOME OF GIFTS FOR THE TROOPS.]

Full  early,  the  popular  German illustrated  papers  gave  pictures  of
Christmas on the field of battle, and it was very evident that our enemies
anticipated a joyous  day or two: this, probably, thanks  to the idea that
at Christmas-time all the Armies might  call something of a halt, although
it was understood they  were not in the least likely  to do so officially.
It was also anticipated that the  conditions of the Christmas spent by the
Germans  at  the front  would,  like  those  experienced  by our  own  men
and  those of  the  Allied Armies,  be ameliorated  by  the reception  and
distribution  of  gifts from  home.  For  a considerable  while  Germany's
women-folk, especially,  collected gifts for  fathers and brothers  at the
front; and it is certain that their efforts were much appreciated.

[Illustration: UNDERGROUND, WITH GRAMOPHONE, WHITE TABLE-COVER, AND
FLOWERS: FRENCH SOLDIERS IN A "HOME-LIKE" BOMB-PROOF TRENCH.]

Our photograph  reproduces a snapshot,  by a French artillery  officer, in
the trenches to the east of the Aisne. It shows how some of the French are
making  the best  of things,  regardless of  weather and  the enemy.  They
hollowed out the  trench at one point (describes the  officer), and roofed
it over with planks and earth, forming a bomb-proof. A seat was cut at the
sides and a table  got from a village near. A roll  of sheet-iron found in
the  village was  made a  chimney for  a fire  with a  cosy chimney-corner
beside it. With some wire, also, a sort of candelabra was constructed. The
flowers on the  table are in a  German shell for vase,  and the gramophone
was another village "find." It is evident  that the war may develop a race
of military troglodytes.

WORKING IN A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM, SAFE FROM SHELL-FIRE.]

Our illustration shows  how and why the motive-power  of the Expeditionary
Force, the brain of the Army, is  often to be found below-ground. Mr. John
Dakin, writing of this drawing, made by him from a sketch which he made at
the Front, says: "Throughout the war, the enemy has displayed considerable
skill in  locating and shelling  any buildings selected for  occupation by
our Staff. Various methods of  countering these tactics have been devised.
On at least  one occasion, headquarters was established  in a subterranean
apartment, which was not merely bomb-proof, but a comfortable retreat from
the  weather.  Here,  by  lamplight,  plans were  worked  out;  scraps  of
information  pieced  together  with  the  aid  of  maps  without  risk  of
interruption from the enemy."--[_Drawn by  John Dakin from his Sketch made
on the Spot._]

[Illustration: AFTER THE ENEMY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO COME WITHIN
POINT-BLANK RANGE OF THEIR SILENT FOE:]

Determined night-onslaughts by  infantry have been, according  to a letter
from Petrograd, a notable feature of  the German tactics in the battles on
the  Vistula, particularly  in the  fighting  that has  been taking  place
between  Lowicz and  the river.  By day,  the Germans,  we are  told, were
persistently  aggressive, continuously  launching attacks  against various
points of the Russian lines, while the Russians remained on the defensive.
With the  coming of darkness,  however, regularly, night after  night, the
Germans  redoubled  their  efforts  everywhere, taking  advantage  of  the
obscurity  to fling  forward dense  swarms and  columns of  men in  massed
formation, to  storm the  entrenched Russian  position, apparently  at any
cost. They failed every time, it would appear, beaten back after literally
a  massacre.  The Russian  tactics,  it  is  interesting to  recall,  were

exactly the  same as those  with which, as our  own officers and  men have
described in letters  home, Sir John French's battalions in  every case so
effectively shattered the  German efforts at breaking  through the British
during  the retreat  after Mons.  The Russians,  it is  stated, invariably
allowed the Germans to come in to well within point-blank range, remaining
silent, holding their fire and not showing a light meanwhile. Then, as the
enemy got within point-blank range, searchlights were suddenly switched on
and  a ceaseless  fusillade  of  Maxim and  rifle-fire  from the  Russians
literally mowed the Germans down by hundreds, breaking up their masses and
paralysing the attack.  Our illustration shows one of the  combats just at
the critical moment.--[_Drawn by Frédèric de Haenen._]

[Illustration: SHIPS THE BRITISH NAVY MIGHT HAVE HAD! FREAKS OF MARINE
ARCHITECTURE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY ADOPTED.]

We  illustrate here  and on  the page  opposite some  curious designs  for
war-ships by various  inventors. No. 1 is  McDougal's Armoured Whale-back,
with  conning-towers, a  design  of 1892  for  converting whalebacks  into
war-vessels.  No. 2  is an  American  design of  1892, Commodore  Folger's
Dynamite Ram, cigar-shaped,  with two guns throwing masses  of dynamite or
aerial torpedoes. No. 3 is a design by the Earl of Mayo in 1894 and called
"Aries the  Ram," built round  an immense beam  of steel terminating  in a
sharp point, No. 4 is Gathmann's boat for a heavy gun forward, designed in
1900. She was to  be of great speed, and the forward gun  was to throw 600
lb. of gun-cotton at the rate of 2000 feet per second. A formidable Armada
this, had it been practicable.

[Illustration: SHIPS THE BRITISH, AND THE GERMAN, NAVY MIGHT HAVE HAD!
DESIGNS BY THE KAISER AND OTHER NAVAL THEORISTS.]

The first illustration on this page is  a design for a battle-ship made by
the Kaiser in 1893,  to replace the old "Preussen," then  out of date. The
vessel  was  to  carry  four  large barbettes  and  a  huge  umbrella-like
fighting-top. Illustration No. 2 is  an Immersible Ironclad, designed by a
French engineer named  Le Grand, in 1862.  In action the vessel  was to be
partly  submerged, so  that only  her  three turrets  and the  top of  the
armoured glacis  would be visible.  No. 3  is Admiral Elliott's  "Ram," of
1884.  The  ship was  to  carry  a  "crinoline"  of stanchions  along  her
water-line, practically  a fixed  torpedo-net. No.  4 is  Thomas Cornish's
Invulnerable  Ironclad, of  1885. She  was to  have two  separate parallel
hulls under water; above she was of turtle-back shape.

Our illustration shows  a halt in one  of the squares of Warsaw  of one of
the regiments  of Siberian infantry, whose  magnificent fighting qualities
in all  the battles  of the war  in the eastern  theatre of  operations in
which they have  taken part have gained  for them, as the  accounts of the
different actions  sent to  London from  Petrograd testify,  the outspoken
admiration of the whole Russian  Army. Particularly singled out for praise
has been their audacious expertness  in close-quarter combats. They supply
both infantry and  artillery, and are recruited all  over Siberia, forming
ordinarily two separate commands, the  East Siberian and the West Siberian
troops, which garrison the  fortresses and districts between Vladisvostock
and the  Ural Mountains, the  dividing range between European  and Asiatic
Russia.

[Illustration: THE LETTER HOME: A BRITISH SOLDIER WRITING IN A LOFT OVER
A COW-SHED "SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FRONT."]

One  of the  happiest features  of  the Great  War,  and one  of its  most
favourable omens, is  the optimistic spirit in which  our troops, officers
and men  alike, are  making the  best of  things, in  spite of  the trying
conditions in  which they have to  live and carry out  their arduous work.
They  are  as proof  against  physical  discomfort  or hardships,  and  as
determined to  be "jolly,"  as was Mark  Tapley himself.  Our illustration
shows one of our soldiers writing home  from the loft over a cow-shed, his
only shelter "somewhere near the front."  A shaft of sunlight relieves the
gloom of his rough surroundings, and no doubt is reflected in the messages
he is  sending to  his friends at  home. It is  this wholesome  spirit, in
small  matters  and  in  great,  which  makes  for  success.--[_Photo.  by

DEAD: AND SERBIAN WOMEN HELPING WITH THE GUNS.]

It  has  fallen  to  the  Serbians   to  furnish  the  most  complete  and
overwhelming triumph  yet achieved in  the war--the smashing  victory over
the  Austrian  Army on  the  River  Drina during  the  first  ten days  of
December.  Our  photographs  were  taken  on  and  near  the  battlefield.
No.  1 on  the  first page  represents a  preliminary  incident. It  shows
an  Austrian  patrol  captured  while   pressing  forward  with  the  rash
assurance that  characterised the  Austrian headlong advance.  No. 2  is a
battlefield  scene, on  December 3,  when the  Serbians suddenly  attacked
the  Austrians  and  broke  up  their  positions  at  all  points  at  the
outset,  making  whole regiments,  scattered  and  isolated among  ravines
and  valleys,  in  many  instances, surrender  at  discretion.  One  corps
of  disarmed  Austrian  prisoners  is  seen while  being  marched  to  the

rear.  No. 3  shows Serbian  villagers placing  wreaths on  the graves  of
fallen  countrymen. Photograph  No. 4  lets  us realise  something of  the
heroic part the women villagers took in helping to achieve the triumph. As
the  battle took  shape they  came forward  and cheered  the men-folk  on,
calling out  "Napréd, braco,  Napréd," "Forward, brothers,  forward," also
helping (as our photograph shows) to push the cannon and ease the worn-out
horses. Yet another instance of the work the Serbian women did is shown in
our page  photograph. Owing to the  lack of Red Cross  men attendants, the
peasant women took  on themselves to serve  as stretcher-bearers, bringing
in  the wounded,  as these  fell in  fight, to  the dressing-tents  in the
villages and  the churches,  which were  used as  hospitals.--[_Photos. by

[Illustration: WITH "SPIT" HELD BY RIFLES, A SPADE, AND A COUPLE OF
STICKS: COOKING THE CHRISTMAS GEESE AT THE FRONT.]

There was no Christmas  truce at the front. The grim  realities of the war
over-rode all considerations  of sentiment, and the hope which  was, for a
while, common to both sides had to be left unfulfilled. None the less, the
Season was not  without its little luxuries, and, thanks  to the excellent
work  of the  Army Service  Corps  and the  thoughtfulness of  sympathetic
friends  at home,  there  was  no dearth  of  substantial necessaries  and
comforts, as well as tobacco and cigarettes galore. Our illustration shows
a group  of soldiers  cooking their  Christmas geese in  the open,  and as
intent  upon their  task as  though  such conditions  were quite  orthodox
and  even such  minor alarums  as  "spasmodic artillery  duels, and  local
fusillades" were things unheard of.--[_Photo. by L.N.A._]

It is pleasant  to think that, with  all the dangers and  anxieties of the
war, our soldiers at the front paid  tribute to the season of goodwill. It
is a reassuring picture, this of the  two men in khaki, rifle on shoulder,
but  swinging  from the  deadly  barrels  berried  mistletoe, so  rich  in
suggestion of the happiness of Christmases when the scourge of war was not

The  conditions under  which tens  of  thousands of  soldiers spent  their

passed  without such  observance of  old customs,  and such  care for  all
available good  cheer, as were  possible. Our illustration shows  a French
soldier obviously enjoying  his Christmas dinner despite the  fact that he
has to eat it by the wayside.--[_Photo. by Alfieri._]

As with our  London soldiers at the  front, the fortune of  war has levied
its toll on  other Londoners. Our photograph depicts  the unfortunate fate
that has befallen  a once well-known object in the  streets of London--one
of  the motor-'buses  shipped across  to France  to serve  in transporting
British troops to  the front, now in  the hands of the enemy.  Not many of
them have  had such bad luck,  from all accounts, but  accidents cannot be
helped, and  a victim  has been  claimed now and  again, mostly  at places
where some raiding  Uhlan patrol has managed  to cut in and  ambush one on
some outlying road  near the line of communications between  the front and
an  army base,  catching the  'bus while  returning after  discharging its
soldier "fares."

[Illustration: WEAPONS OF GREY "MOLES," AT TSING-TAU: A LAND-MINE AND

The Germans made use of land-mines in  the defence of Tsing-tau, and a few
days after  the town's surrender, on  Nov. 7, several exploded  while they
were being  removed by  the Japanese,  causing much loss  of life.  It was
stated  that the  explosions  killed  two officers  and  eight men,  while
one  officer  and  fifty-six  men  were injured.  The  Germans  also  used
hand-grenades, as  shown in our photograph.  These appear to have  been of
the improvised "jam-tin" type such as has been employed in the trenches in
Flanders  "Eye-Witness" wrote  recently: "Mines  have not  played such  an
important part  in this  mole-work as  might have  been supposed.  We have
heard the  enemy mining and  we have tried  it ourselves, but  one strikes
water in  this country  between seven and  eight feet  down."--[_Photo. by

"In  the Argonne  we  beat  back the  enemy's  attacks  and preserved  our
front." That  is a typical announcement  one constantly sees in  the Paris
_communiqués_ recording events in the  district where the photograph given
above was taken. Special interest being taken in the fighting in Flanders,
one rather  overlooks the give-and-take  warfare being carried  on further
east, where  siege-trench fighting like that  on the Aisne still  goes on.
There the  Germans occupy deeply  dug lines which  are largely made  up of
underground  galleries partly  natural, partly  artificial, in  character,
as  our  photograph shows.  When  the  French  artillery fire  is  severe,
the  Germans  scuttle like  rabbits  into  their  burrows, coming  out  to
man  the  trenches in  front  immediately  the  French infantry  begin  to
approach.--[_Photo. by C.N._]

  Pure, easily digestible milk is the only food suitable for a young baby,
  and contains  everything baby needs.  That is  why, if Baby  cannot have
  breast milk,  he _must_ have  Glaxo, which  is milk enriched  with extra
  cream made  pure and easily digestible.  It costs you but  a trifle more
  than  ordinary milk,  and  is  not only  the  one  safe alternative  for
  breast-milk, but  is also more  economical than  foods which have  to be
  mixed with  milk to make them  nourishing. Glaxo can be  given either in
  turn with breast-milk or as the sole food from birth.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
