INTRODUCTION


The small yellow tree frogs, _Hyla microcephala_ and its relatives,
are among the most frequently heard and commonly collected frogs in
the lowlands of southern México and Central America. The similarities
in size, proportions, and coloration of the different species have
resulted not so much in a multiplicity of specific names, but in
differences of opinion on the application of existing names to the
various taxa. For example, the populations on the Atlantic lowlands
have been known by three names, two of which have been applied to
other taxa. Much of the confusion has been the result of previous
workers' unfamiliarity with the animals in life and unawareness of the
intraspecific geographic variation in the most widespread species.

Independently we undertook studies of these frogs in the field. The
second author worked on the interspecific relationships and isolating
mechanisms in Panamá (Fouquette, 1960b) and later studied the species
in southern México. As part of his survey of the hylids of Middle
America, the first author accumulated field and laboratory data on the
frogs throughout their ranges in México and Central America. The
purpose of this report is to present our findings on the four species
of Middle American frogs that we place in the _Hyla microcephala_
group. In addition to conventional taxonomic characters, we have
utilized the features of the cranial osteology and have relied heavily
on the data obtained from an analysis of the mating calls.
Furthermore, we have included ecological and distributional data in
our synthesis of interspecific relationships.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Examination of specimens was made possible by the provision of working
space at various institutions or through the loan of specimens. For
their generosity in this manner we are grateful to Richard J. Baldauf,
Charles M. Bogert, James E. Böhlke, Doris M. Cochran, Robert F. Inger,
John M. Legler, Alan E. Leviton, Gerald Raun, Jay M. Savage, Hobart M.
Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Wilmer W. Tanner, Charles F. Walker, Ernest
E. Williams, and Richard G. Zweifel.

Duellman is especially grateful to Charles W. Myers, Linda Trueb,
Jerome B. Tulecke, and John Wellman for their assistance in the field
and to Linda Trueb for her work on the cranial osteology that is
incorporated in this report. Fouquette is indebted to H. Morgan Smith
and A. C. Collins for assistance in the field, to A. J. Delahoussaye
for assistance in the laboratory, and to W. Frank Blair for use of the
facilities of the sound laboratory at the University of Texas and for
much help in the early stages of this study.

The research reported herein was accomplished mainly through support
by the National Science Foundation (grants NSF G-9827 and GB-1441 to
Duellman and GB-599 to Fouquette). The latter's field work in México
was assisted in part by NSF Grant G-4956 to W. Frank Blair. Some of
the field studies carried out in Panamá by Duellman were supported by
a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH GM-12020).

We are grateful to many persons, too numerous to mention, who in
various ways aided our field work in Middle America. We are especially
indebted to Dr. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo and the late Ing. Luis Macías
Arellano of the Dirección General de la Fauna Silvestre of the Mexican
government for providing permits to collect in México.


Materials and Methods

For this report, data has been obtained from 2829 preserved frogs, 42
skeletal preparations, 8 lots of tadpoles and young, and 4 lots of
eggs. Much of the material was collected in our independent field
work, which has extended over a period of 11 years.

Measurements were taken in the manner described by Duellman (1956).
Osteological data were obtained from specimens that were cleared in
potassium hydroxide, stained with alizarin red, and stored in
glycerine. Recordings were made by means of Magnemite portable tape
recorders (Amplifier Corp. America). The calls recorded by Fouquette
were analyzed on a Sonagraph (Kay Electric Co.) at the University of
Texas; those recorded by Duellman were analyzed mainly on a Vibralyzer
(Kay Electric Co.) at the University of Kansas and in part on a
Sonagraph at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. Sample calls
were analyzed on all three instruments; the slight differences in
results were found to be less than the error in measurement, so the
data from all sources were combined without correction. The techniques
and terminology of the calls are those defined by Fouquette (1960a,
1960b).

In the accounts of the species we have attempted to give a complete
synonymy. At the end of each species account the localities from which
specimens were examined are listed alphabetically within each state,
province, or department, which in turn are listed alphabetically
within each country. The countries are arranged from north to south.
Localities preceded by an asterisk (*) are not plotted on the
accompanying maps due to the crowding of symbols that would have
resulted. Abbreviations for museum specimens are listed below:

27 mm. in males and 32 mm. in females; dorsum yellowish tan with brown
markings; thighs uniformly yellow, vocal sac in breeding males yellow;
snout truncate in lateral profile; tympanum distinct, usually slightly
smaller than one-half diameter of eye; vocal sac single, median,
subgular; fingers about one-third webbed; toes webbed nearly to bases
of discs, except only to middle of antepenultimate or base of
penultimate phalanx of fourth toe; tarsal fold weak; inner metatarsal
tubercle low, flat, elliptical; axillary membrane present; pupil
horizontally elliptical; palpebral membrane unmarked; cranial elements
reduced in ossification; sphenethmoid small, short; frontoparietal
fontanelle large; tegmen tympani not extensive; quadratojugal greatly
reduced; anterior arm of squamosal extending only about one-fourth
distance to maxillary; posterior arm of squamosal not having bony
connection with proötic; nasals lacking maxillary processes; medial
ramus of pterygoid not having bony attachment to proötic; maxillary,
premaxilary, and prevomerine teeth present; palatine and parasphenoid
teeth absent; Mentomeckelians ossified; tadpoles having xiphicercal
tails with deep caudal fins and terminal mouth lacking teeth; mating
call consisting of one primary note followed by a series of shorter
secondary notes; haploid number of chromosomes, 15 (known only in _H.
microcephala_ and _H. phlebodes_.)

_Content._--As recognized here the _Hyla microcephala_ group contains
four species, one having two subspecies. An alphabetical list of the
specific and subspecific names that we consider to be applicable to
the _Hyla microcephala_ group are listed below.


           Names Proposed                        Valid Names

_Hyla cherrei_ Cope, 1894             ? = _H. m. microcephala_
_Hyla microcephala_ Cope, 1886          = _H. m. microcephala_
_Hyla microcephala_ Boulenger,
  1898 (_nec_ Cope, 1886)               = _H. microcephala underwoodi_
_Hyla microcephala martini_ Smith, 1951 = _H. microcephala underwoodi_
_Hyla microcephala sartori_ Smith, 1951 = _H. sartori_
_Hyla phlebodes_ Stejneger, 1906        = _H. phlebodes_
_Hyla robertmertensi_ Taylor, 1937      = _H. robertmertensi_
_Hyla underwoodi_ Boulenger, 1899       = _H. microcephala underwoodi_


_Discussion._--The color pattern is the most useful character in
distinguishing the species of the _Hyla microcephala_ group from one
another. Except in _Hyla microcephala_, little geographic variation in
color pattern is noticeable. The features of color pattern that are
helpful in identifying the species are: 1) presence or absence of
lateral dark brown stripe; 2) longitudinal extent and width of lateral
stripe, if present; 3) presence or absence of a narrow white line just
dorsal to the lateral dark stripe; 4) presence or absence of an
interorbital dark mark; 5) the arrangement of dark markings on the
back, either as longitudinal lines or series of dashes, or in the form
of various kinds of transverse markings; 6) presence of dark flecks,
longitudinal line, or transverse marks on shanks.

Few consistent differences in measurements and proportions exist among
the species (Table 1). The most obvious morphological difference is
that the head is noticeably narrower in _H. robertmertensi_ than in
the other species. _Hyla phlebodes_ is the smallest species; adult
males attain snout-vent lengths of only 23.6 mm. The body is slender
in _H. microcephala_ and _robertmertensi_, slightly wider in
_phlebodes_, and noticeably broader in _sartori_.

_Distribution._--The composite range of the Middle American frogs of
the _Hyla microcephala_ group includes the lowlands of southern México
and Central America, in some places to elevations of 1200 meters,
southeastward from southern Jalisco and southern Veracruz, excluding
arid regions (northern Yucatán Peninsula, Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin,
Plains of Tehuantepec, Grijalva Valley, Salamá Basin, and upper
Motagua Valley) to the Pacific lowlands and the Cauca and Magdalena
valleys in Colombia.

_Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe narrow, extending from nostril
along canthus, along upper edge of tympanum to groin, bordered above
by narrow white line; pair of dark brown longitudinal lines on dorsum
extending to vent; shanks having dark longitudinal line or flecks, no
transverse bars; interorbital dark mark lacking.

_Description and Variation._--The color pattern is nearly constant. Of
103 males from the Canal Zone, all lack an interorbital dark bar, and
all have a dark longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of the shank
and a narrow lateral dark stripe, bordered above by a narrow white
line, extending to the groin. The longitudinal dark lines on the
dorsum are continuous to the groin in 95 specimens and fragmented in
two specimens. In two others the lines converge and fuse in the
scapular region, and in four specimens auxiliary, fragmented lines are
present dorsolaterally.

In all specimens from southeastern Costa Rica (Golfito, Palmar Sur,
and Villa Neilly) the pattern is constant, except that in about 10 per
cent of the specimens the longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of
the shank is replaced by a row of brown flecks.

Of the limited number of Colombian specimens examined, all are
patterned normally, except three from Sautata, Chocó, three from
Curumani, and three from Arcataca, Magdalena, which have flecks on the
dorsal surfaces of the shanks, and one from Espinal, Tolima, which has
no markings on the shanks.

When active at night most individuals are pale yellowish tan dorsally;
the white dorsolateral line is noticeable, but the brown lateral
stripe, dorsal brown lines, and lines on shanks are so pale that often
they are barely discernible. By day the dorsum changes to tan or pale
reddish brown; the stripes are dark brown, and the dorsolateral stripe
that is white at night becomes creamy yellow (Pl. 13). Small brown
flecks are present on the dorsum of most individuals. The venter
always is white, and the iris is pale bronze with a brown tint
immediately anterior and posterior to the pupil. In breeding males the
vocal sac is pale yellow.

_Tadpoles._--Tadpoles of this species have been found in weed-choked
ponds in eastern Panamá Province. The following description is based
on KU 104097, a specimen in developmental stage 34 (Gosner, 1960).

Total length, 20.5 mm.; body length, 8.2 mm.; body slightly wider
than deep; snout pointed; nostrils large, situated dorsally, much
closer to snout than eyes, directed anteriorly; eyes moderately
small, situated dorsolaterally and directed laterally; spiracle
sinistral, located just posteroventral to eye; anal tube dextral.
Tail xiphicercal; caudal musculature moderately deep, becoming
slender posteriorly, extending beyond caudal fin; fins deepest at
about one-third distance from body to tip of tail; dorsal fin
extending onto body, deeper than deepest part of caudal
musculature; ventral fin slightly shallower than musculature.
Mouth small, terminal, lacking teeth and fringing papillae, but
having finely serrate beaks. In preservative, top of head pale
brown; dark stripe from tip of snout through eye to posterior edge
of body, narrowing to thin line on proximal one-fourth of tail;
venter white; tail creamy tan with fine black flecks most numerous
posteriorly; posterior two-thirds of fins edged with black. In
life, top of head yellowish tan; lateral stripe brown; belly
white; anterior half of tail lacking pigment; posterior half deep
orange; iris pale bronze (Pl. 15).

_Remarks._--Evidence for intergradation of _Hyla microcephala_ with
_H. underwoodi_ is provided by four specimens [USC 818 (2), 6081-2]
from 6.1 kilometers northeast of the mouth of the Río Tarcoles, and
nine specimens [USC 8254 (2), 8255, 8256 (4), 8258 (2)] from Parrita,
both in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. These localities lie about
two-thirds the distance from the northwesternmost locality for _H.
m. microcephala_ (Palmar Sur) to the southeasternmost locality for
_H. m. underwoodi_ (Barranca). Although in most aspects of coloration
the frogs are more nearly like _H. m. underwoodi_ than _H. m.
microcephala_, some specimens have longitudinal lines on their shanks,
such as are characteristic of _H. m. microcephala_. The dorsal pattern
varies from nearly complete longitudinal lines to broken lines, fused
into an X-shaped scapular mark or not.

As noted by Rivero (1961:135), _Hyla microcephala_ seems to be closely
related to _Hyla misera_ Werner, a species having a wide distribution
east of the Andes in South America. Despite the similarity in color
pattern, size, and structure, we are reluctant to place the two taxa
in the same species until data on coloration in life, mating calls,
and life history are available for _Hyla misera_ and compared with
those of _Hyla microcephala_.

The status of Cope's _Hyla cherrei_ is questionable. Since the type,
the only specimen ever referred to the species, apparently is lost,
the only extant information regarding the taxon is contained in the
original description (Cope, 1894). There the species was characterized
as having a narrow dorsolateral white stripe and lacking pigment on
the upper arms and thighs. These characteristics of the color pattern
combined with the statements "vomerine teeth few, opposite the middle
of the very large choanae" and "tympanic drum distinct, one half the
area of eye" serve to distinguish _H. cherrei_ from all other Costa
Rican hylids, except _H. m. microcephala_ and _H. m. underwoodi_. No
statements in the type description will definitely associate _cherrei_
with one or the other of these subspecies. Since it seems obvious that
_H. cherrei_ can be associated with _H. microcephala_, we prefer to
place the name in the synonymy of the nominate subspecies, thereby
preserving the commonly used name _H. underwoodi_ (Boulenger, 1899) as
a subspecies of _H. microcephala_.

_Distribution._--_Hyla microcephala microcephala_ inhabits coastal
lowlands from the area of Golfo Dulce (apparently absent from the
Osa Peninsula) in southeastern Costa Rica eastward in Panamá,
including the Azuero Peninsula to northern Colombia and thence
southward in the valleys of the Río Cauca and Río Magdalena in
Colombia (Fig. 1). Except for the central area of the Canal Zone
the subspecies is unknown from the Caribbean drainage in Central
America, but in Colombia the subspecies occurs only in the
Caribbean drainage. In Central America this frog occurs mostly on
the coastal lowlands; the highest recorded elevation is 560 meters
at El Valle, Coclé, Panamá. Throughout most of its range _Hyla
microcephala microcephala_ occurs in disturbed habitats--cut-over
forests, secondary growth, and pastureland. It does not seem to be
an inhabitant of either primary forest or of _Curatella_-savanna.

_Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe narrow, extending to groin or
only to sacral region, bordered above by narrow white line; dorsal
pattern bold, consisting of X- or )(-shaped mark in scapular
region or pair of interconnected dark lines on back; interorbital
dark mark usually present; shanks usually having dark transverse
bars.

_Description and Variation._--The dorsal color pattern is highly
variable. The various permutations of the X-shaped scapular mark
and dark sacral marks differ proportionately in different samples.
The variation in color pattern in 12 samples is summarized in
Table 2. In samples from the southern part of the range (southern
Nicaragua and Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica) more (40-93%)
individuals have the lateral stripes extending to the groin than
in northern samples (0-42%) from southern México and Guatemala.
Likewise, the percentage of specimens lacking bars on the shanks and
a dark interorbital bar is higher in the Costa Rican samples than
elsewhere in the range. The X- or )(-shaped scapular markings and
/\- or / \-shaped sacral markings are most prevalent in northern
samples, whereas to the south the dorsal markings are more commonly
arranged in a pattern of paired lines, which usually are discontinuous
and usually extend posteriorly only to the sacral region. Thus, the
color pattern in _H. m. underwoodi_ in the southern part of its range
shows trends towards the pattern characteristic of _H. m.
microcephala_. Intergrades between these two subspecies have
been discussed in the account of the nominate subspecies.

[Footnote A: Longitudinal stripes present in two specimens.]



When this frog is active at night its dorsum is pale yellow; faint
flecks are present in some individuals. The white dorsolateral line
usually is evident in the tympanic region, but in many individuals a
dorsal pattern of lines and other marks is not evident. By day the
dorsum changes to yellowish tan or pale brown with dark brown or
reddish brown markings (Pl. 13). The venter is white, and the vocal
sac in breeding males is yellow. The iris is pale bronze with a brown
tint anterior and posterior to the pupil.

_Remarks._--_Hyla microcephala underwoodi_ has had a confused
nomenclatural history. The taxon was first named _Hyla microcephala_
by Boulenger (1898); this name was preoccupied by _Hyla microcephala_
Cope (1886). Cole and Barbour (1906) and Kellogg (1932) used the name
_Hyla phlebodes_ Stejneger (1906) for specimens of this frog from
México. Dunn (1931, 1933, 1934) applied the name _Hyla underwoodi_ to
Panamanian specimens that we identify as _Hyla phlebodes_. Smith
(1951) named _Hyla microcephala martini_ from southern México and
Guatemala and considered the northern populations to represent a
subspecies distinct from the Costa Rican _Hyla microcephala
underwoodi_, despite the fact the Stuart (1935:39) stated that
comparisons of specimens from El Petén, Guatemala, with the holotype
of _Hyla underwoodi_ showed only trivial differences.

Much of the confusion regarding the name _Hyla underwoodi_ stems from
the illustration given by Boulenger (1898:pl. 39, fig. 3) and
reproduced by Taylor (1952:892), which shows a frog having a unicolor
dorsum, dorsolateral white lines, and dark flanks. This pattern is in
marked contrast to the pattern seen in most preserved specimens, which
have the dorsum variously marked by dark brown lines or irregular
marks. Smith (1951:185), in his description of _Hyla microcephala
martini_ from southern México, considered _H. underwoodi_ to be a
subspecies of _H. microcephala_ that lacked dorsal dark markings.

Data accumulated in 1961 through field studies by the senior author at
the type locality, Bebedero, and other localities in Guanacaste and
Puntarenas provinces in Costa Rica provide a reasonable explanation of
the differences in color pattern. As noted in the preceding description
of this subspecies, at night the dorsal markings are not evident in
many living individuals, whereas by day the dorsal markings are
prominent. Most collectors prepare their specimens by day; consequently
the majority of specimens have a pronounced dorsal pattern. Of the
frogs collected in Costa Rica in 1961, some specimens were preserved
at night; others from the same series were preserved by day. The
differences are striking. In those preserved at night, dorsal markings
are faint, if present at all. Some specimens closely match the figure
given by Boulenger (1898).

It is extremely doubtful if the frog described and illustrated by
Boulenger could be associated with either _Hyla phlebodes_ or _H.
microcephala microcephala_. Individuals of the former species lack
a dorsolateral white line and always have some dorsal markings
evident at night; furthermore, _H. phlebodes_ is not known to occur
on the Pacific lowlands. _Hyla microcephala microcephala_ occurs
farther southeast. Since there is no reason to doubt the type locality
of _H. underwoodi_, since specimens from the area around the type
locality that have been preserved at night are like the holotype in
pattern, and since the characteristics of the populations of the frogs
in Guanacaste are the same as, or gradually blend into those of,
populations in northern Central America and southern México, the
frogs from throughout the entire range can be referred to one taxon,
the earliest name for which is _Hyla underwoodi_ Boulenger, which
herein is considered to be a subspecies of _H. microcephala_ Cope.

_Distribution._--_Hyla microcephala underwoodi_ inhabits the
Atlantic slopes and lowlands from southern Veracruz and extreme
northern Oaxaca eastward across the base of the Yucatan Peninsula
(possibly the species is extant in the northern part of the
peninsula) to British Honduras and thence southeastward through
the Caribbean lowlands and interior valleys in Honduras to central
Nicaragua, where it apparently avoids the forested Caribbean
lowlands and the dry Pacific lowlands of northwestern Nicaragua,
but in the vicinity of Managua invades the Pacific lowlands and
continues southward into northwestern Costa Rica as far as the
Puntarenas Peninsula (Fig. 1). In México and Guatemala the species
has not been taken at elevations of more than 350 meters, whereas
farther south it occurs at higher elevations--780 meters at
Silencio, Costa Rica, 830 meters on Montaña de Guaimaca, Honduras,
960 meters at Finca Tepeyac, Nicaragua, and 1200 meters at Finca
Venecia, Nicaragua.

_Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe wide, including loreal region and
entire tympanum, extending to groin, bordered above by narrow white
line; dorsum unicolor or with pair of dark lines (or rows of dashes)
usually extending only to the sacral region; shanks having dark flecks,
no transverse bars; interorbital bar lacking.

_Description and Variation._--Males attain a maximum snout-vent length
of 26.4 mm. in Oaxaca, whereas in a sample from Acacoyagua, Chiapas,
the largest male has a snout-vent length of 25.7 mm., and from La
Trinidad, Guatemala, 24-6 mm. Specimens from the western part of the
range (eastern Oaxaca) have slightly smaller heads and proportionately
larger tympani than the more eastern populations (Table 1).

The color pattern shows little variation, except in the nature of the
dorsal markings. In a few specimens from throughout the range, but
especially in the eastern part of the range, the dorsum lacks markings
between the dorsolateral white lines. In most specimens the dorsal
pattern consists of flecks or dashes arranged in two parallel
longitudinal rows, and in some specimens the marks are fused into
parallel lines. Small brown flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces
of the shanks; in some specimens these flecks tend to form a
longitudinal stripe on the shank. An interorbital dark mark is
invariably absent.

When active at night _Hyla robertmertensi_ is pale yellow above with a
white dorsolateral line and pale brown lateral stripe; the dorsal
markings are faint. By day the dorsum is yellowish tan with brown
markings. The dorsolateral stripe is creamy white, and the lateral
stripe is dark brown (Pl. 14). The venter is white, and the iris is
dull bronze. In breeding males the vocal sac is yellow.

_Remarks._--Although this species superficially resembles _Hyla
microcephala microcephala_, the latter is easily distinguished by the
narrow brown lateral stripe, as compared with the much wider stripe
in _H. robertmertensi_. No other hylids in northern Central America
and southern México can be confused with this species.

_Distribution._--_Hyla robertmertensi_ inhabits the Pacific slopes (to
elevations of 700 meters) and lowlands from eastern Oaxaca (east of
the Plains of Tehuantepec) southeastward to central El Salvador. The
species also occurs in the Cintalapa Valley (Atlantic drainage) in
southwestern Chiapas (Fig. 2.) The distribution seems to be limited on
the northwest and southeast by arid environments. The region in which
_Hyla robertmertensi_ lives is characterized by higher rainfall and
more luxuriant vegetation than occur on the Plains of Tehuantepec or
on the Pacific lowlands of eastern El Salvador and southern Honduras.
In addition to the localities listed below, Mertens (1952:30)
recorded the species from Hacienda Cuyan-Cuya, Depto. Sonsonate, El
Salvador.

_Diagnosis._--Dark brown lateral stripe, if present, usually extending
only to insertion of forearm, never posteriorly to sacral region;
white line above brown stripe absent or faint; dorsal pattern weak,
usually consisting of irregular dashes or interconnected lines;
interorbital dark mark present; shanks having weakly defined
transverse bars.

_Description and variation._--In the majority of specimens (70%) the
lateral dark stripe extends from the nostril to the eye and thence
above the tympanum to a point above the insertion of the arm; in 17
per cent the stripe extends to the mid-flank, whereas in 13 per cent
the stripe is absent. A narrow and faint white line is present on the
canthus in some specimens, but no distinct white stripe is present
above the lateral dark line posterior to the eye. An interorbital bar
and transverse marks on the shanks are invariably present. The dorsal
markings are variable, but in most specimens (92%) consist of either
an X- or )(-shaped mark in the scapular region; in the other specimens
the markings are irregular short lines or absent. Approximately equal
numbers of specimens have a transverse bar, chevron, or broken lines
in the sacral region, whereas about eight per cent of the specimens
lack markings in the sacral region.

When active at night, individuals are pale yellowish tan with faint
brown dorsal markings. By day they are tan with more distinct brown
markings (Pl. 14). The thighs are pale yellow; the belly is white. The
iris is pale creamy tan with brown flecks. In breeding males the vocal
sac is yellow.

_Tadpoles._--Tadpoles of this species have been found in an extensive
grassy pond at Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica. The following description is
based on KU 104099, a specimen in development stage 36 (Gosner, 1960).

Total length, 21.0 mm.; body length, 6.7 mm.; body slightly wider than
deep, snout pointed; nostrils large, directed anteriorly, situated
near end of snout; eyes small, situated dorsolaterally, directed
laterally; spiracle sinistral, located just posteroventral to eye;
anal tube dextral. Tail xiphicercal; caudal musculature moderately
deep, extending far beyond posterior edge of fins; fins deepest at
about midlength; dorsal fin extending onto body, slightly deeper than
caudal musculature; ventral fin slightly shallower than musculature.
Mouth small, terminal, lacking teeth and fringing papillae, but having
finely serrate beaks. In preservative top of head olive-tan with brown
flecks; dark stripe from snout through eye to posterior edge of body;
belly white, flecked with brown anteriorly; tail creamy tan with
grayish brown blotches. In life, dorsum of body reddish tan mottled
with darker brown; lateral stripe dark brown; belly white, mottled
with brown and black; caudal musculature heavily pigmented with
grayish tan; posterior tip of tail marked with dark gray; caudal fins
heavily blotched with grayish tan; iris orange-tan peripherally, red
centrally (Pl. 15).

_Remarks._--This species has been confused with _Hyla microcephala
underwoodi_ by many workers. Dunn (1931, 1933, 1934) and Breder (1946)
referred Panamanian specimens of _H. phlebodes_ to _H. underwoodi_;
likewise, Gaige, Hartweg, and Stuart (1937) made the same error. Cole
and Barbour (1906) and Kellog (1932) used the name _H. phlebodes_ for
Mexican specimens of _H. microcephala underwoodi_. The similarity in
color pattern of _H. microcephala underwoodi_ and _H. phlebodes_
easily accounts for the misapplication of names. Although both species
have nearly identical dorsal color patterns, that of _H. microcephala
underwoodi_ usually is bolder. Furthermore, in that species a narrow
white line usually is present above the well-defined lateral dark
stripe, whereas the lateral dark stripe is short and posterior to the
eye is not bordered above by a white line in _H. phlebodes_.

The type locality "San Carlos, Costa Rica" given by Stejneger
(1906:817) apparently refers to a region, the Llanuras de San Carlos,
in the northern part of Alajuela Province, Costa Rica.


  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Map showing locality records for
      _Hyla phlebodes_.]


_Distribution._--_Hyla phlebodes_ inhabits humid tropical forests from
southeastern Nicaragua southeastward on the Caribbean slopes and
lowlands to the Canal Zone in Panamá, thence eastward in the Chucunaque
Basin of eastern Panamá and onto the Pacific lowlands of Colombia
(Fig. 3). The species also reaches the Pacific slopes in the Arenal
Depression in northwestern Costa Rica and in the Panamanian isthmus,
where it occurs in humid forests on the Pacific slope of El Valle and
Cerro La Campana. Mostly the species is found at low elevations, but
it occurs at 600 meters at Turrialba and at 700 meters at Finca San
Bosco in Costa Rica.

_Diagnosis._--Dorsum tan with broad dark brown chevrons or transverse
bars; shanks marked with two or three broad transverse bars;
dorsolateral stripes absent.

_Description and variation._--No noticeable geographic variation is
apparent in either structural features or coloration in this species.
All specimens lack a dorsolateral dark stripe and white line, although
a dark line is present on the canthus and dissipates in the loreal
region. A broad interorbital brown bar is present in all specimens.
The color pattern on the dorsum invariably consists of a broad, dark,
chevron-shaped mark in the scapular region and a broad dark chevron or
transverse bar in the sacral region. The shanks invariably have two or
three dark brown transverse bars.

When active at night individuals are yellowish tan above with chocolate
brown markings (Pl. 14). The belly is white, and the thighs are pale
yellowish tan. The iris is dark bronze-color. In breeding males the
vocal sac is yellow. By day some individuals were observed to change
to creamy gray with distinct darker markings.

_Remarks._--Although tadpoles of this species have not been found,
observations on the breeding sites indicate that the tadpoles probably
develop in ponds. Except for calling males observed around a pool in a
stream-bed 11.8 kilometers west-northwest of Tierra Colorada, Guerrero,
all breeding congregations have been found at temporary ponds.

Smith (1951:186) named _Hyla sartori_ as a subspecies of _Hyla
microcephala_. This subspecific relationship seemed reasonable until
analysis of the mating calls showed that the call of _H. sartori_ is
more nearly like that of _H. phlebodes_ than that of _H. microcephala_.
The broad hiatus separating the ranges of _H. microcephala_ and _H.
sartori_ is additional evidence for considering _H. sartori_ as a
distinct species.


  [Illustration: Fig. 4. Map showing locality records for
      _Hyla sartori_.]


_Distribution._--_Hyla sartori_ occurs in mesophytic forests to
elevations of about 300 meters on the Pacific slopes of southern México
from southwestern Jalisco to south-central Oaxaca (Fig. 4). The lack of
specimens from Colima and Michoacán probably reflects inadequate
collecting instead of the absence of the species there. On the basis of
available habitat the species would be expected to occur in Nayarit,
but extensive collecting there has failed to reveal its presence. The
semi-arid Plains of Tehuantepec apparently limit the distribution to
the east.

CRANIAL OSTEOLOGY


The frogs of the _Hyla microcephala_ group have a minimal amount
of cranial ossification as compared to more generalized hylid skulls,
such as _Smilisca_ (Duellman and Trueb, 1966). In the _Hyla
microcephala_ group the sphenethmoid is small and short, and a large
frontoparietal fontanelle is present. The quadratojugal exists only
as a small spur and is not in contact with the maxillary. The proötics
are poorly developed. The anterior and posterior arms of the squamosal
are short; the anterior arm extends no more than one-fourth of the
distance to the maxillary, and the posterior arm does not have a bony
connection with the proötic. The nasal lacks a maxillary process, and
the medial ramus of the pterygoid lacks a bony connection to the
proötic.

Teeth are absent on the parasphenoid and palatines, but present on the
maxillaries, premaxillaries, and prevomers. The teeth are simple,
pointed, and slightly curved. Although the number of teeth varies
(Table 3), no consistent differences between the species are apparent.


Table 3.--Variation in the Number of Teeth in the Species of the Hyla
      Microcephala Group. (N=Number of Jaws, or Twice the Number of
      Individuals; Means are Given in Parentheses After the Observed

Despite the great reduction in the ossification of the cranial
elements, certain apparently consistent differences exist between the
species seem to be consistent. The most notable differences are:
1) amount of ossification of the frontoparietals and consequent shape
and size of the frontoparietal fontanelle, 2) shape of the nasals,
3) shape and extent of the sphenethmoid, and 4) shape of the columella
(Table 4, Figs. 5-6). On the basis of these characters, _Hyla
microcephala_ can be set apart from the other species and characterized
as having a poorly ossified frontoparietal and correspondingly large
frontoparietal fontanelle; long, slender, arcuate nasals; extremely
short sphenethmoid; and expanded distal end of the columella. The other
species in the group (_phlebodes_, _robertmertensi_, and _sartori_)
have more ossification of the frontoparietals, broader nasals, only a
moderately short sphenethmoid, and an unexpanded distal end of the
columella. Among these three species, the skulls of _phlebodes_ and
_robertmertensi_ are most nearly alike, whereas the skull of _sartori_
differs by having a differently shaped frontoparietal fontanelle,
broader nasals, and an ossified anterior extension of the sphenethmoid
between the nasals (compare Fig. 5b with Fig. 6 a-b).

Although all skulls examined belong to breeding adults, the extent of
the ossification of the frontoparietals and the resulting shape of the
frontoparietal fontanelle might be correlated with the age of the frog.
Nevertheless, in the 24 skulls of _Hyla microcephala_ examined, the
frontoparietals are less extensively ossified than in the skulls of the
other species. The trivial differences among the other three species
certainly are suggestive of close relationship, but on the basis of
present knowledge of the evolutionary trends in hylid cranial
osteology, the differences offer little evidence for determining
phylogenetic lineage.




ANALYSIS OF MATING CALLS


Calls of all five taxa were compared in several characteristics, of
which three are deemed most significant systematically. These are
1) the pattern and duration of the notes of a call-group, 2) the
fundamental frequency, and 3) the dominant frequency. Air temperatures
were noted at the time the calls were recorded, but no valid
correlation could be determined between this factor and any of the
parameters of the calls; consequently recordings made at all
temperatures (21-29° C.) were grouped together.

_Pattern and duration of notes._--In all five taxa the basic pattern
consists of a call-group made up of one primary note followed by a
series of shorter secondary notes. In some species the secondary notes
differ from the primary in other characteristics. Both subspecies of
_Hyla microcephala_ have a long, unpaired primary note followed by 0
to 18 (usually about 4) somewhat shorter paired secondary notes. In
calls of _Hyla m. microcephala_ the mean duration of the primary is
0.131 (0.10-0.16) second and that of the secondaries is 0.101
(0.05-0.14) second, whereas in _H. m. underwoodi_ the mean duration of
the primary is 0.018 (0.05-0.15) second and that of the secondaries is
0.086 (0.06-0.11) second.

_Hyla robertmertensi_ has a reverse of this pattern in that the primary
note is paired and the secondaries are unpaired. In the sample studied
a call-group contains 0-28 secondary notes (generally about 3). The
mean duration of the primary is 0.091 (0.07-0.11) second and that of
the secondaries is 0.040 (0.025-0.06) second.

_Hyla phlebodes_ and _sartori_ have call-groups composed of a rather
short, unpaired primary and several short, unpaired secondaries
(0-28 in _phlebodes_, 0-23 in _sartori_). The mean duration of the
primary of _phlebodes_ is 0.105 (0.07-0.16) second and that of the
secondaries is 0.067 (0.035-0.12) second. The mean duration of the
primary of _sartori_ is 0.080 (0.07-0.09) second and that of the
secondaries is 0.053 (0.035-0.07) second.

The two subspecies of _H. microcephala_ are identical in call pattern
and agree closely in duration of notes, although those of the nominate
subspecies tend to be slightly longer. _Hyla robertmertensi_ is
distinctive in call pattern in that it is the only species having a
paired primary; the duration of the primary is completely overlapped by
that in the other species, but the secondaries tend to be the shortest
in the group. The call patterns of _H. phlebodes_ and _H. sartori_ are
identical and the range of duration of notes of _phlebodes_ completely
overlaps that of _sartori_, although both the primary and secondary
notes of the latter tend to be somewhat shorter (Table 5, Pl. 16).

_Fundamental frequency._--This parameter was analyzed for the primary
notes. It was measured for the secondaries as well and was found to
differ in magnitude in the same way as the primary note. In a few
examples of both subspecies of _H. microcephala_ a high primary note,
in which the fundamental frequency is exceptionally high, is sometimes
emitted (Fouquette, 1960b). None of these notes was used in this
analysis; only the fundamental frequencies of normal primary notes are
compared (Table 5, Fig. 7).

----------------+--+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------------


The two subspecies of _H. microcephala_ agree closely in fundamental
frequency. There is considerable overlap, but the difference
between the means is significant at the 0.001 level of probability
(t = 4.2406). The call of _H. robertmertensi_ does not overlap that
of _H. sartori_ or either subspecies of _H. microcephala_ in this
parameter; but it does overlap that of _H. phlebodes_, although again
the difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level
(t = 9.360). _Hyla phlebodes_ and _sartori_ have the lowest fundamental
frequencies, and there is some overlap, but here too the difference
between the means is significant at the 0.001 level (t = 4.923).

_Dominant frequency._--A dominant band of frequencies cuts across
the harmonics of the fundamental, obscuring the harmonic pattern and
generally shifting upward in frequency. The midpoint of this band is
measured at the terminal border as the dominant frequency. As with the
fundamental frequency, only the normal primary notes were utilized in
the comparisons (Table 5, Fig 8).


  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Variation in the fundamental frequency of the

      horizontal lines = range of variation, vertical lines = mean,
      solid bars = twice the standard error of the mean, and open
      bars = one standard deviation. The number of specimens in each
      sample is indicated in parentheses after the name of the taxon.]


The two subspecies of _H. microcephala_ agree more closely in this
parameter than in fundamental frequency. The overlap is great, but the
difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level
(t = 3.658). The calls of both subspecies completely overlap that of
_robertmertensi_ in this parameter, but the difference between the
means is significant at the 0.001 level. The calls of _H. phlebodes_
and _H. sartori_ overlap considerably in this characteristic, although
the difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level
(t = 7.504) (Fig. 9). The call of neither species overlaps those of
_H. microcephala_ and _robertmertensi_.

      the mean, and open bars = one standard deviation. The number of
      specimens in each sample is indicated in parentheses after the
      name of the taxon.]


  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Scatter diagram relating the dominant and
      fundamental frequencies of the normal primary notes in the
      _Hyla microcephala_ group. Each symbol represents a different
      individual.]


_Repetition rate._--The repetition rate of the secondary notes, in
calls consisting of more than one secondary, was measured for each
form. A considerable amount of variation in this parameter was found
in all of the taxa (Table 5). This variation probably is due in part
to the effect of temperature differences. Repetition rate is the only
parameter analyzed for which there is a correlation with the
air-temperature, but even here the correlation is weak, probably due
to the microenvironmental effects of humidity, air-movement, and other
factors in addition to the ambient air temperature that influences the
body temperature of the frogs. These rates are nearly alike in both
subspecies of _H. microcephala_ and in _phlebodes_. The repetition
rates in _H. robertmertensi_ and _H. sartori_ are considerably faster
than in the other three taxa. _Hyla sartori_ has the fastest
repetition rate of the group.

In all characteristics of the mating calls the two subspecies of
_H. microcephala_ agree closely, as might be expected, although the
differences are statistically significant. _Hyla robertmertensi_ is
distinctive in call pattern and seems to be closer to _microcephala_
in dominant frequency but closer to _H. phlebodes_ in fundamental
frequency. Thus, it is somewhat intermediate between _microcephala_
and _phlebodes_. The identical pattern and similarity in fundamental
and dominant frequencies of the calls of _H. phlebodes_ and _H. sartori_
possibly indicate close relationship.

_Geographic variation in call._--_Hyla m. microcephala_ has higher
fundamental and dominant frequencies in Costa Rica than in Panamá. In
Costa Rican _H. m. underwoodi_ the fundamental and dominant frequencies
are lower than in other parts of the range. Frogs of this subspecies
recorded in Nicaragua and Honduras have slightly lower dominant
frequencies and higher fundamental frequencies than those recorded in
Guatemala or Oaxaca. The duration of both primary and secondary notes
decreases to the south; samples from Nicaragua and Costa Rica have the
shortest notes. Comparison of duration of notes in the two subspecies
shows that the Panamanian _H. m. microcephala_ have slightly longer
notes than do any _H. m. underwoodi_; the more northern populations of
_H. m. underwoodi_ from México most closely approach _H. m.
microcephala_ in this characteristic.

The calls of _H. robertmertensi_ in Oaxaca have higher dominant and
fundamental frequencies and longer secondary notes than do those in
Chiapas.

The calls of _H. phlebodes_ recorded at Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica,
have slightly lower dominant frequencies than do those recorded at
Turrialba, Costa Rica, and in Panamá, whereas those recorded at
Turrialba have lower fundamental frequencies than in other samples.
The duration of notes is slightly shorter in both Costa Rican samples
than in those recorded in Panamá.




LIFE HISTORY


The frogs of the _Hyla microcephala_ group breed in shallow grassy
ponds. In some places they breed in permanent ponds, but usually
congregate around temporary pools, such as depressions in forests,
flooded fields, and roadside ditches. At the height of their breeding
season, usually in the early part of the rainy season, the
congregations are made up of large numbers of individuals. In April,
1961, and in June, 1966, the senior author noted nearly continuous
choruses of _H. m. microcephala_ in roadside ditches along the 75
kilometers of road between Villa Neily and Palmar Sur, Puntarenas
Province, Cost Rica; on June 20, 1966, at Puerto Viejo, Heredia
Province, Costa Rica, he estimated approximately 900 _Hyla phlebodes_
in one pond, and two nights later noticed that the number of
individuals had increased substantially. Other observations by the
first author on size of breeding congregations include nearly
continuous choruses of _H. m. underwoodi_ between Villahermosa and
Teapa, Tabasco, in July of 1958, an estimated 400 _Hyla robertmertensi_
in a road side ditch 7.2 kilometers west-northwest of Zanatepec,
Oaxaca, on July 13, 1956, and approximately 150 _Hyla sartori_ around
a rocky pool in a riverbed, 11.8 kilometers west-northwest of Tierra
Colorada, Guerrero, on June 28, 1958.

The length of the breeding season seemingly is more dependent on
climatic conditions in various parts of Middle America than on
behavioral differences in the various species. Thus, Fouquette (1960b)
found in the Canal Zone that _H. m. microcephala_ formed breeding
choruses from May through January, the entire rainy season in that
area. In the wetter coastal region of Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica,
the species breeds as early as mid-March, whereas in the drier region
encompassing Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, and southwestern
Nicaragua breeding activity is initiated by the first heavy rains of
the season, usually in June.

_Hyla phlebodes_ inhabits regions having rainfall throughout the year.
Although large breeding congregations are most common in the early
parts of the rainy season, males probably call throughout the year. At
Puerto Viejo in Costa Rica the senior author has heard _Hyla phlebodes_
in February, April, June, July, and August. Charles W. Myers noted
calling males of this species in the area around Almirante, Bocas del
Toro Province, Panamá, in September, October, and February. An
exception to the correlation between rainfall and breeding activity
was noted by the junior author in _Hyla phlebodes_ in the Canal Zone,
where he noticed a decrease in activity of that species in October and
November, when the rains are heaviest and most frequent. Furthermore,
independent observations made by both of us indicate that _H.
phlebodes_ does not reach peaks of activity during or immediately
after heavy rains, but instead builds up to peaks of activity two or
three days after a heavy rain. This is in contrast to the other
species, all of which characteristically inhabit drier environments
than does _H. phlebodes_. Peaks of breeding activity in the other
species occur immediately after, or even during, heavy rains.

The calling location of the males generally is on vegetation above,
or at the edge of, the water. _Hyla microcephala_ and _H. phlebodes_
call almost exclusively from grasses and sedges; _phlebodes_ usually
calls from taller and more dense grasses than does _microcephala_.
Except for some minor differences in calling location observed by
the junior author (Fouquette, 1960b) in the Canal Zone, the differences
in density and height of grasses utilized for calling-locations
probably is dependent primarily on the nature of the available
vegetation. Although bushes and broad-leafed herbs are usually present
at the breeding sites, males of these species seldom utilize them for
calling locations. Both _H. robertmertensi_ and _H. sartori_ have been
observed calling from grasses, herbs, bushes, and low trees. Calling
males of _robertmertensi_ have been found two meters above the ground
in small trees.

Daytime retreats in the breeding season sometimes are no more than
shaded clumps of vegetation adjacent to a pond or in clumps of grass
in a pond. Individuals of _H. m. underwoodi_ were found by day under
the outer sheaths of banana plants next to a water-filled ditch. Dry
season refuges are unknown.

Amplexus is axillary in all four species. Egg deposition has been
observed in _H. m. microcephala_, _m. underwoodi_, and _phlebodes_.
In all three the eggs are deposited in small masses that float near
the surface of the water and usually are at least partly attached to
emergent vegetation. Each clutch does not represent the entire egg
complement of the female.

Tadpoles are definitely known of only _H. m. microcephala_ and
_phlebodes_; these have been described in the preceding accounts of
the species. The tadpoles of these two species can be distinguished
readily (Pl. 15). The tadpole of _H. microcephala_ has a uniformly
white venter and nearly transparent tail, whereas in _H. phlebodes_
the venter is flecked anteriorly and the tail is mottled. In life, _H.
microcephala_ is easily recognized by the orange posterior half of
the tail, whereas the tail in _H. phlebodes_ is mottled tan and grayish
brown.




PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS


The evidence already presented on osteology, external structure,
coloration, mating call, and life history emphatically show that the
four species under consideration are a closely related assemblage.
Now the question arises: To what other groups in the genus is the
_Hyla microcephala_ group related? Furthermore, it is pertinent to
this discussion to attempt a reconstruction of the phylogeny of the
group as a whole and of the individual species in the _Hyla
microcephala_ group. With regard to the relationships of the group we
must take into account certain species in South America. Our endeavors
there are hampered by the absence of data on the mating calls and life
histories of most of the relevant species.

As mentioned in the account of _Hyla m. microcephala_, the species
_microcephala_ possibly is subspecifically related to _Hyla misera_, a
frog widespread in the Amazon Basin. _Hyla misera_ resembles
_microcephala_ in coloration, external structure, and cranial
characters. The frontoparietals are equally poorly ossified, and the
frontoparietal fontanelle is extensive. Our principal reason for not
considering the two taxa conspecific at this time is our lack of
knowledge concerning the color of living _H. misera_, the structure of
the tadpoles, and the characteristics of the mating call. Even with the
absence of such data that we think essential to establish the
nomenclature status of the taxa, we are confident that the two are
sufficiently closely related that any discussion of the phylogenetic
relationships of one species certainly must involve consideration of
the other.

_Hyla misera_ possibly is allied to other small yellowish tan South
American _Hyla_ that lack dark pigmentation on the thighs. Probable
relatives are _Hyla elongata_, _minuta_ (with _goughi_, _pallens_,
_suturata_, _velata_, and possibly others as synonyms), _nana_, and
_werneri_. The consideration of the interspecific relationships of
these taxa is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can say that each
of these species has a pale yellowish tan dorsum, relatively broad
dorsolateral brown stripe, and narrow longitudinal brown lines or
irregular marks on the dorsum. Furthermore, examination of the skulls
of _elongata_, _nana_, and _werneri_ reveals that they are like
_misera_ and _microcephala_ in the nature of the frontoparietal
fontanelle and in having a greatly reduced quadratojugal. Thus, on the
basis of cranial and external characters the _Hyla microcephala_ group
can be associated with _Hyla misera_ and its apparent allies in South
America. This association can be only tentative until the mating calls,
tadpoles, and chromosome numbers of the South American species are
known.

Among the Middle American hylids, only the _Hyla microcephala_ group
and _H. ebraccata_ have a haploid number of 15 chromosomes (Duellman
and Cole, 1965). All other New World _Hyla_, for which the number is
known, have a haploid number of 12; the only other _Hyla_ having 15
is a Papuan _Hyla angiana_ (Duellman, 1967).

_Hyla ebraccata_ occurs in the humid tropical lowlands of Middle
America and the Pacific lowlands of northwestern South America. It is
the northernmost, and only Central American, representative of the
_Hyla leucophyllata_ group, which is diverse (about 10 species
currently recognized) and widespread in tropical South America east of
the Andes. This group is characterized by having broad, flat skulls
with larger nasals and more ossification of the frontoparietals than
in the _Hyla microcephala_ group. The quadratojugal is present as a
small anteriorly projecting spur that does not connect with the
maxillary. Externally, the _Hyla leucophyllata_ group is characterized
by having a well-developed axillary membrane, uniformly yellow thighs,
and a dorsal color pattern in many species consisting of a dark lateral
band, a pale dorsolateral band or dorsal ground color, and a large
middorsal dark mark. In some species, the dorsal pattern consists of
small dark markings or is nearly uniformly pale. At least in the
Central American _Hyla ebraccata_, the mating call consists of a
single primary note followed by a series of shorter secondary notes,
the tadpoles have xiphicercal tails and lack teeth, and the haploid
number of chromosomes is 15. On the strength of these observations it
seems imperative to consider the _Hyla leucophyllata_ group as a close
ally to the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Successful artificial
hybridization supports the close relationship of _H. m. microcephala_
and _phlebodes_; partial success of artificial hybridization of these
two with _ebraccata_ (Fouquette, 1960b) provides further evidence for
close relationship between the _Hyla leucophyllata_ and _Hyla
microcephala_ groups.

In México and northern Central America two small species, _Hyla picta_
and _Hyla smithi_, comprise the _Hyla picta_ group. These frogs
resemble members of the _Hyla microcephala_ group by having a
yellowish tan dorsum with a dorsolateral white stripe and uniformly
yellow thighs. Furthermore the mating call is not unlike those of
the species in the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Despite these
similarities, the _Hyla picta_ group differs from the _Hyla
microcephala_ group by having a well-developed quadratojugal that
connects to the maxillary, tadpoles with teeth present and caudal fins
completely enclosing the caudal musculature, and a haploid number of
12 chromosomes. In all of these characteristics the frogs of the

_Hyla picta_ group more closely resemble other Middle American _Hyla_
than they do the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Therefore, it can best be
presumed that the superficial resemblances of coloration and the
mating call are the result of convergence.

Since the _Hyla microcephala_ and _leucophyllata_ groups apparently
are related and since the greatest diversity of these frogs is in
South America (if _Hyla misera_ and its relatives are placed with the
_Hyla microcephala_ group), it seems appropriate to place the centers
of origins of these groups in South America. Therefore, the _Hyla
microcephala_ group and _Hyla ebraccata_ of the _Hyla leucophyllata_
group either have immigrated into Central America, or they are
representatives of those groups that were isolated in Central America
during most of the Cenozoic when South America was separated from
Central America.

The interspecific relationships of the species in the _Hyla
microcephala_ group are not clear. On the basis of coloration, _H. m.
microcephala_ and _H. robertmertensi_ are close, and _H. m. underwoodi_
and _H. phlebodes_ are nearly identical. The mating calls of _H.
phlebodes_ and _sartori_ closely resemble one another, whereas the call
of _robertmertensi_ is intermediate between these and _microcephala_.

In most respects _Hyla microcephala_ is distinct from the other
species, and with the exception of the amount of ossification of the
frontoparietals, the other species can be easily derived from a
_microcephala_-like ancestor. Possibly the slightly increased
ossification of the frontoparietals in _robertmertensi_, _phlebodes_,
and _sartori_ is secondary, or possibly after differentiation of the
species the amount of ossification was further reduced in
_microcephala_. If so, the species fall into a reasonable phylogenetic
scheme that has _microcephala_ as the extant species most like the
ancestral stock.

We visualize the evolutionary history of the group to have followed
a course that began with the invasion of Central America by a
_microcephala_ ancestral stock that differentiated into two populations
in lower Central America--a _microcephala_-like frog on the Pacific
lowlands and a _phlebodes_-like frog on the Caribbean lowlands.
Differentiation could have been brought about by isolation by montaine
or marine barriers. The population on the Pacific lowlands either was
preadapted for subhumid conditions or became so adapted and dispersed
northward onto the Pacific lowlands of northern Central America.
Simultaneously the frogs on the Caribbean lowlands, which were adapted
to humid environments, dispersed northward in the humid forested
regions to southern México and crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec onto
the Pacific slopes of Oaxaca and Guerrero northward to Jalisco.
Subsequent development of arid conditions, possibly in the Pliocene,
Pleistocene, or even as late as the Thermal Maximum in post-Wisconsin
time, resulted in a restriction of the ranges in northern Central
America, thereby isolating part of the _phlebodes_-stock on the
Pacific slopes of México, where it adapted to drier conditions and
evolved into _sartori_. The rest of the _phlebodes_-stock was
restricted to the humid forests on the Caribbean lowlands of lower
Central America. The increased aridity on the Pacific lowlands
eliminated the _microcephala_-stock from southern Honduras and
northwestern Nicaragua and in so doing left an isolated population on
the lowlands of Chiapasand Guatemala, which differentiated into
_robertmertensi_. The original stock on the Pacific lowlands of Panamá
and southeastern Costa Rica became _microcephala_.

If the _microcephala_-stock was, as we believe, better adapted for
existence under subhumid conditions than was the _phlebodes_-stock,
the development of subhumid conditions in much of the lowland region
of northern Central America and southern México would have permitted
the expansion of the range of _microcephala_ into the area now
inhabited by _H. m. underwoodi_, while _phlebodes_ was being eliminated
from this area by climatic conditions that were unsuited to its
survival there. Perhaps the similarity in coloration of _H. m.
underwoodi_ and _phlebodes_ is the result of convergence or possibly
hybridization occurred at the time the former was expanding its range
and the latter's range was being restricted. If hybridization did
occur, the differences in mating call subsequently were enhanced,
thereby providing a valid isolating mechanism in sympatric populations.

_Hyla microcephala_ and _phlebodes_ range into northern South America.
Probably both species entered South America in relatively recent times
after they had differentiated from one another in Central America.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
