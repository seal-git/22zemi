INTRODUCTION


TO the modern wide-awake, twentieth-century woman efficiency in
household matters is quite as much a problem as efficiency in business
is to the captains of industry.

How to make pure food, better food and to economize on the cost of same
is just now taxing the attention and ingenuity of domestic science
teachers and food experts generally. The average housewife is intensely
interested in the result of these findings, and must keep in touch with
them to keep up with the times and run her home in an intelligent and
economical as well as healthful routine.

The eternal feminine question is, "What shall we have for dinner
to-day?" It is not always the easiest thing in the world to think of a
seasonable menu, nor to determine just the right combination that will
furnish a meal appetizing and well-balanced in food values. Furthermore,
both the expense and the amount of work entailed in preparation must be
considered.

This Cook Book is especially designed to meet just that pressing daily
need of the housewife. It presents for her guidance a menu for every
Sunday dinner in the year; it suggests dishes which are seasonable as
well as practical; it tells in a simple, intelligent manner just how
these dishes can be made in the most wholesome and economical form; and
the recipes have all been especially made for this book and tested by
that eminent expert, Mrs. Elizabeth O. Hiller.

The title of "52 Sunday Dinners" has been given the book because Sunday
dinners as a rule are a little more elaborate than the other dinners of
the week, but from these menus may be gleaned helpful hints for daily
use.

While climatic conditions differ somewhat in various sections of the
country, we have tried to approximate the general average, so that the
suggestions might be as valuable to the housewife in New England as to
the housewife in the West or South, or vice versa.

Simplicity, economy and wholesomeness have been given preferred
attention in the preparation of these recipes, many of which are here
presented for the first time.

In the interest of health and economy a number of the recipes suggest
the use of Cottolene--a frying and shortening medium of unquestioned
purity--in place of butter or lard. Cottolene is a vegetable shortening,
pure in source and manufactured amid cleanly favorable surroundings. It
is no new, untried experiment, having been used by domestic science
experts and thousands of housewives for nearly twenty years; to them
Cottolene for shortening and frying is "equal to butter at half the
price, better and more healthful than lard--and more economical than
either." We, therefore, offer no apologies for the small proportion of
recipes specifying the use of Cottolene, and suggest that a trial will
convince any housewife that Cottolene makes better food than either
butter or lard, and is preferable from the standpoints of efficiency,
economy and healthfulness.

We commend this book to your critical inspection and test, believing you
will find it convenient, helpful, unique and pointing the way to better
and more economical living.

For All Shortening and Frying Use COTTOLENE


YEARS ago nothing but butter or lard were used for shortening and
frying; to-day the visible supply of these two products is insufficient
to supply the demand, taking into consideration the amount of butter
required for table use. Furthermore, as the demand increased it outgrew
the supply of butter and lard, with the result that prices were
materially advanced; and, incidentally, the quality has been lowered.
Naturally, under such conditions scores of substitutes have been offered
as shortening and frying mediums--some meritorious, but mostly inferior.

Cottolene is not offered the housewife as a cheap imitation of either
butter or lard, but as a vegetable product which is superior to either
for cooking purposes. Because it happens to be about half the price of
butter, or less, is but an additional reason, from a purely economical
standpoint, for its use. The main argument for the use of Cottolene is
the purity of its ingredients and the wholesomeness of the food prepared
with it.

There isn't an ounce of hog fat in Cottolene, and from cottonfield to
kitchen human hands never touch the product. It is pure and absolutely
free from taint or contamination from source to consumer. Packed in our
patent, air-tight tin pails, Cottolene reaches you as fresh as the day
it was made. Lard and butter are sold in bulk, and do not have this
protection.

Cottolene is always uniform in quality, and because of its freedom from
moisture it goes one-third farther than butter or lard, both of which
contain about 20% of water. It is much more economical than lard; about
50% more so than butter.

Cottolene contains no salt, and is richer in shortening properties than
either butter or lard. Two-thirds of a pound of Cottolene will give
better results than a pound of either butter or lard.

Because Cottolene is made from sweet and pure oils, refined by our own
special process, it makes food more digestible. Its use insures light,
flaky pie-crust; it makes deliciously crisp, tender doughnuts; for
cake-making it creams up beautifully and gives results equal to the best
cooking butter; muffins, fritters, shortcake and all other pastry are
best when made with Cottolene; it makes food light and rich, but never
greasy. Cottolene heats to a higher temperature than butter or lard, and
cooks so quickly the fat has no chance to soak in.

You can fry fish in Cottolene and use the remaining fat for frying
potatoes or other food. The odor of fish will not be imparted to the
other food fried in the fat. Cottolene is just as pure and healthful as
olive oil, and is unqualifiedly recommended by leading physicians,
domestic science authorities and culinary experts as wholesome,
digestible and economical. The use of Cottolene in your frying and
shortening will both save you money and give you better results.




HOW TO USE COTTOLENE


The General Care of Cottolene

Exercise the same care and judgment with Cottolene as you would with
butter, lard or olive oil; keep it in a moderately cool place when not
in use, just as you would butter--so that its best qualities may be
preserved.

Moreover, just because you occasionally buy strong butter or rancid lard
which your grocer has kept in too warm a place, you do not denounce all
butter or lard and give up their use; neither would it be fair to
condemn Cottolene simply because your grocer may not have kept it
properly. No fat will keep sweet indefinitely without proper care.


The Use of Cottolene for Shortening

Of course, the recipes in this book indicate the exact amount of
Cottolene to be used. In your other recipes, however, a general, _and
important_, rule for the use of Cottolene is:

=Use one-third less Cottolene than the amount of butter or lard given in
your recipe.=

For cake-baking, cream the Cottolene as you would butter, adding a
little salt; _Cottolene contains no salt_. For other pastry handle
exactly the same as directed for either butter or lard, using one-third
less.


The Use of Cottolene in Frying

In _sautéing_, _browning_ or "_shallow frying_" (as it is sometimes
called) use only enough Cottolene to grease the pan. The Cottolene
should be put into the pan _while cold_ and, after the bottom of the pan
is once covered with the melted Cottolene, more can be added as desired.
Add more fat when you turn the food.

Cottolene can be heated to a much higher temperature without burning
than either butter or lard, but--unless allowed to heat gradually--the
Cottolene may burn and throw out an odor, just as would any other
cooking-fat.

For _deep frying_, have Cottolene at least deep enough to cover, or
float, the article being fried, heating slowly. For uncooked mixtures,
such as doughnuts, fritters, etc., test with one-inch cubes of stale
bread. The cubes of bread should brown a golden brown in one minute; or
test with a bit of dough, which should rise at once to the top with some
sputtering. Make this test always,--never trust your eye. The fat should
be kept at an even temperature. For cooked mixtures, such as croquettes,
fish balls, etc., the cube of bread should brown a golden brown in 40
seconds.

Uncooked fish and meat are better when covered with bread crumbs, to
keep the crisp crust desired in frying food (see note on Egging and
Crumbing under Culinary Hints, Page 12). The fat should be hot at first,
that it may not penetrate; then reduce the heat, that the food may cook
till done, without burning.

Crumbed food is usually arranged in a croquette basket before placing it
in the hot fat. This prevents the food from moving about, which
sometimes causes the crust to loosen from the food, allowing it to
absorb the fat.

Never let the fat heat to smoking point, for then it is burning hot, and
the food will burn on the outside while the inside remains raw and
uncooked. Cook only three or four pieces at once, for more will chill
the fat and prevent perfect frying.

After the food has been cooked by this frying method it should be
carefully removed at once from the fat and drained on brown paper.


Care of Cottolene After Frying

After the frying is done, the fat should be allowed to stand in a cool
place to permit any sediment to settle. When cool, pour the fat
carefully through a double fold of cheesecloth, or through a fine
strainer. It is then ready for use.

Cottolene does not retain the taste or odor from any article whatever
that may be fried in it, and it may be used over and over again. You may
from time to time, add fresh Cottolene to it as your quantity
diminishes, but the frying qualities of the Cottolene are not affected
by the shrinkage of the fat.




What Noted Cooking Experts Think of Cottolene.


THE high regard in which Cottolene is held by all those who have made a
careful study of food preparation and food values is conclusively shown
by the following testimonials received from famous authorities on
Domestic Science:


Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer

Principal Philadelphia Cooking School and Culinary Editor "The Ladies'
Home Journal."

          "_I use Cottolene in every and all the ways that
          one would use lard, also in the preparation of
          sweet cakes. I consider it an important frying
          medium and a much more healthful product than
          lard._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Marion Harland

Author of the famous "Marion Harland Cook Book."

          "_Many years ago I discontinued the use of lard in
          my kitchen and substituted for it--as an
          experiment--Cottolene, then comparatively a new
          product. Since my first trial of it I can truly
          say that it has given complete satisfaction,
          whether it is used alone, as 'shortening,' or in
          combination with butter in pastry, biscuit, etc.,
          or in frying. I honestly believe it to be the very
          best thing of its kind ever offered to the
          American housekeeper._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Janet M. Hill

Editor "Boston Cooking School Magazine."

          "_For several years I have used Cottolene in my
          own kitchen and find it very satisfactory. I am
          glad to commend it._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Miss Jennie Underwood


Superintendent The New York Cooking School.

          "_We have used Cottolene for some time in our
          classes here and are more than pleased with the
          results, all agreeing that it is a very valuable
          article. As a shortening agent in pastry, biscuit,
          etc., it has proved all that you claim for it, and
          as a frying agent it is entirely satisfactory._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Miss Mary Arline Zurhorst

Principal National School Domestic Arts and Science, Washington, D. C.

          "_Not only have we found Cottolene invaluable as a
          frying agent, no matter how delicate the
          composition of the article to be cooked, but also
          as a substitute for the shortening in pastries and
          sweets it has no equal._"

       *       *       *       *       *

These are but a few. Other well known authorities who have tested
Cottolene and recommend its use are:

          Mrs. F. A. Benson
          Mrs. Emma P. Ewing
          and Mrs. Christine Terhune Herrick




Eminent Physicians Endorse the Wholesomeness of Cottolene


NINE-TENTHS of all human ailments are due primarily to indigestion or
are aggravated because of it. The chief cause of indigestion is food
prepared with lard. The following are but brief extracts from letters
received, showing the high esteem in which Cottolene is regarded as a
cooking medium by physicians ranking among the highest in the
profession.


J. Hobart Egbert, A. M., M. D., Ph. D.

From an article in the "Medical Summary," entitled, "Available Facts for
Consumptives and Others with Wasting Diseases."

          "_In cooking food, we would recommend the
          preparation known as 'Cottolene,' a wholesome
          combination of fresh beef suet and purest
          cottonseed oil. This preparation is both
          economical and convenient, free from adulteration
          and impurities, and dietetic experiments
          conclusively show that incorporated in food it
          yields to the body available nourishment._"

R. Ogden Doremus, M. D., LL. D.

Professor of Chemistry, Toxicology and Medical Jurisprudence, Bellevue
Hospital Medical College, New York.

          "_As a substitute for lard, which is its purpose,
          Cottolene possesses all the desirable qualities of
          lard without having the objectionable features
          inherent in all products obtained from swine._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Dr. James Page Emery

From an article in the "American Housekeeper" entitled "The Most
Healthful of All Cooking Fats."

          "_Cottolene, being essentially a vegetable
          product, forms the most healthful and nutritious
          cooking medium known to the food experts and
          medical profession._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Wm. Jago, F. I. C., F. C. S.

That eminent chemist, William Jago, than whom there is no higher
authority on cooking fats, reports as follows from Brighton, England:

          "_I find Cottolene to consist practically of 100
          per cent pure fat, the following being the actual
          results obtained by analysis: Percentage of Pure
          Fat, 99.982. I found the 'shortening' effect of 12
          ozs. of Cottolene practically equal to that of 1
          lb. best butter. For hygienic reasons, Cottolene
          may be used with safety as a perfectly harmless
          and innocuous substitute for other fats employed
          for dietetic purposes._"

       *       *       *       *       *

Other eminent physicians who have endorsed and recommended Cottolene
are: =Henry Seffmann, M.D.=, Professor of Chemistry, Woman's Medical
College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; =Prof. Jesse P. Battershall,
Ph.S., F.C.S.=, Chemist U.S. Laboratory, New York; =Dr. Allen McLane

HOW TO MEASURE


ONE cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full measure--all
it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim, or edge, of dry material.
All measurements in this book are level unless otherwise stated, and
_the quantities indicated are designed for a family of six persons_.

Stir up all packed materials, like mustard in its box, and sift flour
before measuring. Fill cup without shaking down, and dip spoon in
material, taking up a heaped measure, then with a knife scrape off
toward the tip till you have level measure. Pack butter or Cottolene in
cup so there will be no air spaces. A scant cup means one-eighth less
and a heaped cup about one-eighth more than a level cup.

Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a half spoon
crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means about one-eighth, so
does a saltspoon; less means a dash or a few grains.

A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much as the spoon
hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It also equals one ounce
in weight, and two rounded tablespoons if put together would heap a
tablespoon about as high as would an egg, giving us the old-time measure
of "butter size of an egg," or two ounces, or one-fourth the cup.

Except in delicate cake, or where it is creamed with sugar, and in
pastry--where it should be chilled to make a flaky crust, COTTOLENE or
butter may be most quickly and economically measured after it is melted.
Keep a small supply in a granite cup, and when needed, stand the cup in
hot water, and when melted, pour the amount desired into the spoon or
cup. For all kinds of breakfast cakes, it is especially helpful to
measure it in this way.

Soda, baking powder, spices, etc., are generally measured with a
teaspoon, level measure, for this gives the proportional amount needed
for the cup measure of other materials.

HELPFUL CULINARY HINTS


On Methods of Cooking

Water _boiling_ slowly has the same temperature as when boiling rapidly,
and will do just the same amount of work; there is, therefore, no object
in wasting fuel to keep water boiling violently.

_Stewing_ is the most economical method of cooking the cheaper and
tougher cuts of meats, fowl, etc. This method consists in cooking the
food a long time in sufficient water to cover it--at a temperature
slightly below the boiling point.

_Braising._ In this method of cooking, drippings or fat salt pork are
melted or tried out in the kettle and a bed of mixed vegetables, fine
herbs and seasoning placed therein. The article being cooked is placed
on this bed of vegetables, moisture is added and the meat cooked until
tender at a low temperature. The last half hour of cooking the cover is
removed, so that the meat may brown richly.

In _broiling_ and _grilling_, the object is first to sear the surface
over as quickly as possible, to retain the rich juices, then turn
constantly until the food is richly browned. _Pan-broiling_ is cooking
the article in a greased, hissing-hot, cast-iron skillet, turning often
and drawing off the fat as it dries out.

_Sautéing_ is practically the same as pan-broiling, except that the fat
is allowed to remain in the skillet. The article is cooked in a small
amount of fat, browning the food on one side and then turning and
browning on the other side.

_Frying._ While this term is sometimes used in the sense of sautéing it
usually consists of cooking by means of immersion in deep, hot fat. When
frying meats or fish it is best to keep them in a warm room a short time
before cooking, then wipe dry as possible. As soon as the food has
finished frying, it should be carefully removed from the fat and drained
on brown paper.


Egging and Crumbing Food

Use for this dry bread crumbs, grated and sifted, crackers rolled and
sifted, or soft stale bread broken in pieces and gently rubbed through
croquette basket; the eggs should be broken into a shallow plate and
slightly beaten with a fork to mix the white thoroughly. Dilute the eggs
in the proportion of two tablespoons cold milk or water to every egg.
The crumbs should be dusted on the board; the food to be fried should be
lightly crumbed all over, then dipped into egg so as to cover the
article entirely, then rolled again in bread crumbs. Sometimes, as in
cooking fish, flour is used for the first coating in place of the
crumbs, the article being then dipped into the egg mixture, then with
crumbs and then fried.


Larding

Consists of introducing small strips of fat, salt pork or bacon through
uncooked meat. To lard, introduce one end of the lardoon (the small
strip of fat) into a larding needle and with the pointed end take up a
stitch one-half inch deep and one-half inch wide. Draw the needle
through carefully so that the ends of the lardoon may project evenly
over the surface of the meat. Oftentimes, however, thin slices of fat,
salt pork or bacon are placed over the meat as a substitute for larding,
although it does not give quite the same delicious flavor or look so
attractive.


Marinating

Consists of adding a pickle, composed of vinegar and oil, to the
ingredients of some combination used in salad making.


Cleaning Cooking Utensils

For washing dishes and cleaning pots and pans use a solution made by
dissolving a teaspoonful or so of Gold Dust Washing Powder in a dish-pan
full of water. If the cooking utensils have become charred or stained in
cooking, sprinkle some Polly Prim Cleaner on a damp cloth and rub
utensil thoroughly. After scouring, rinse the article well in hot water,
and wipe dry. Use Polly Prim Cleaner also, for cleaning cutlery and for
keeping the refrigerator clean and sweet.

OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL

          3 dozen oysters.
          2 lemons cut in quarters.
          Salt, pepper, Tobasco, horseradish and Tomato catsup.

PROCESS: If possible, have the little Blue Points. Open, loosen, and
leave them on the lower shell. Fill soup plates with shaved ice and
arrange shell on ice having the small end of shells point toward center
of the plate. Wash lemons, cut in quarters, remove seeds and serve
one-quarter in center of each plate. Garnish with sprays of parsley
arranged between the shells. Pass remaining ingredients on a small
silver tray, or a cocktail dressing may be made and served in a small
glass dish and passed to each guest.


CONSOMMÉ DUCHESS

Consommé served with a meringue, prepared as follows: Beat the whites of
eggs very stiff and drop by heaping tablespoonsful into milk heated to
the scalding point in a shallow vessel (a dripping pan is the best),
using care that milk does not scorch. Turn each spoonful, allowing it to
cook, until it sets. Place one of these individual meringues on the top
of each service of consommé, and sprinkle with finely chopped parsley.
Serve with Imperial Sticks.


IMPERIAL STICKS

Cut stale bread in one-third inch slices, remove the crusts. Spread
thinly with butter. Cut slices in one-third inch strips, put on a tin
sheet and bake until a delicate brown in a hot oven. Pile "log cabin"
fashion on a plate covered with a doily, or serve two sticks on plate by
the side of cup in which soup is served.


CRAB MEAT IN TIMBALE CASES

          8 Timbale cases.
          2 cups crab meat.
          3 tablespoons butter.
          3 tablespoons flour.
          Yolks 2 eggs.
          1 tablespoon onion finely chopped.
          Salt, pepper, paprika.
          Few grains each cayenne, mustard and nutmeg.
          2 cups hot thin cream.

PROCESS: Melt butter in a sauce pan, add onion and cook five minutes
without browning, stirring constantly. Add flour and stir until well
blended. Add hot cream gradually, continue stirring, add seasoning to
taste. Remove from range and add egg yolks slightly beaten. Reheat crab
meat in sauce (over hot water). Serve in Swedish Timbales.


SWEDISH TIMBALES

          1 cup flour.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1 teaspoon sugar.
          1 egg.
          2/3 cup milk.
          1 tablespoon olive oil.

PROCESS: Mix and sift flour, salt and sugar, add milk slowly, stirring
constantly, add well beaten egg and olive oil. Mixture should be very
smooth, strain and let stand over night. Heat a timbale iron in hot
Cottolene, drain and dip iron into batter, (having batter in a small
pitcher), place in hot Cottolene and fry until crisp and delicately
browned. Remove from iron and invert on brown paper. These dainty cases
are for all kinds of creamed mixtures. They are used instead of patty
shells or croustades.


ROAST GOOSE

PREPARING THE GOOSE FOR THE OVEN

Singe, and remove all pin feathers. Before drawing the bird give it a
thorough scrubbing with a brush, in a warm Fairy soap solution. This is
very necessary for it cleans off all dirt that becomes mixed with the
oily secretions, and opens and cleanses the pores that the oil may be
more readily extracted. Draw and remove everything that can be taken
out, then rinse thoroughly and wipe inside and out, with a clean crash
towel; sprinkle the inside lightly with salt, pepper, and powdered sage.
(The latter may be omitted.)

Stuff with the following mixture and truss as turkey.


POTATO AND NUT STUFFING

(FOR ROAST GOOSE OR DUCK)

          4 cups hot mashed potatoes.
          2-1/2 tablespoons finely chopped onion or chives.
          1 cup English Walnut meats chopped moderately.
          1/2 teaspoon paprika.
          1-1/4 teaspoon salt.
          1/2 cup cream.
          2 tablespoons butter.
          Yolks of 2 eggs.
          1 teaspoon sweet herbs if the flavor is desired.

PROCESS: Mix the ingredients in the order given and fill the body of the
goose.


ROASTING THE BIRD

After trussing, place the goose on a rack in a dripping pan, sprinkle
with salt, cover the breast with thin slices of fat salt pork, and place
in the oven. Cook three-quarters of an hour, basting often with the fat
in the pan. Then remove pan from oven and drain off all the fat. Remove
the slices of pork and sprinkle again with salt and dredge with flour
and return to oven. When the flour is delicately browned, add one cup of
boiling water and baste often; add more water when necessary. Sprinkle
lightly with salt and again dredge with flour. Cook until tender, from
one and one-half to three hours, according to the age of the bird. If
you have a very young goose it is infinitely better to steam or braise
it until tender, then dredge it with salt and flour and brown it richly
in the oven. Serve on a bed of cress, garnish with Baked Snow or
Jonathan apples.


CHANTILLY APPLE SAUCE (WITH HORSERADISH)

Pare, core and cut in quarters, five medium-sized Greenings. Cook with
very little water; when quite dry, rub through a fine purée strainer. To
the pulp add one-half cup granulated sugar, five tablespoons grated
horseradish, then fold in an equal quantity of whipped cream. Serve at
once with roast goose, ducks or goslings.


ONIONS AU GRATIN

Cook one quart of uniform-sized, silver-skinned onions in boiling salted
water. When quite tender, drain and turn into a baking dish; cover with
Cream Sauce (see Page 151), sprinkle the top with fine buttered cracker
crumbs and finish cooking. Brown crumbs delicately.


ENDIVE, CELERY AND GREEN PEPPER SALAD

Select crisp, well-bleached heads of endive, separate the leaves,
keeping the green leaves separate from the bleached; wash and dry.
Dispose the leaves on individual plates of ample size. Arrange the green
leaves first, then the bleached leaves until a nest has been formed;
fill the centers with the hearts of celery cut in one-half inch pieces.
Cut a slice from the stem end of crisp red and green peppers, remove the
seeds and veins and cut in the thinnest shreds possible, using the
shears. Strew these shreds over each portion and, just before serving,
marinate each with French Dressing.


VANILLA ICE CREAM

          3/4 cup sugar.
          1/3 cup water.
          1 quart cream.
          1-1/2 tablespoons vanilla.

PROCESS: Make a syrup by boiling sugar and water three minutes. Cool
slightly and add to cream, add vanilla and freeze in the usual way. Pack
in a brick-shape mold. Bury in salt and ice, let stand several hours.
Remove from mold to serving platter and pour around each portion Hot
Chocolate Sauce.


HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE

Melt two squares chocolate in a sauce-pan, add one cup sugar, one
tablespoon butter and two-thirds cup boiling water. Simmer fifteen
minutes. Cool slightly and add three-fourths teaspoon vanilla.


COCOANUT CUBES

Use recipe for Bride's Cake (see recipe on Page 175). Bake in a sheet.
When cool cut in two-inch cubes and cover each cube with Boiled
Frosting; sprinkle thickly with fresh grated cocoanut.


CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE

          1/3 cup Cottolene.
          2 cups sugar.
          4 eggs.
          1 cup milk.
          2-1/3 cups flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1/4 teaspoon salt.
          2 squares chocolate melted.
          3/4 cup English walnut meats broken in pieces.
          1/2 teaspoon vanilla.

PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add gradually one cup sugar, stirring
constantly. Beat egg yolks thick and light, add gradually remaining cup
of sugar; combine mixtures. Add melted chocolate. Mix and sift flour,
baking powder and salt; add to first mixture alternately with milk. Add
nut meats and vanilla, then cut and fold in the whites of eggs beaten
stiff. Turn into a well-greased tube pan and bake forty-five minutes in
a moderate oven. Cool and spread with boiled frosting.

FLORIDA SALAD

Remove the peel from six large Florida Navel oranges. Separate the
sections, and peel off the membrane, keeping the pulp in its original
shape. Cut each section crosswise once. Dispose the orange cubes equally
in nests of lettuce-heart leaves. Arrange the halves of English walnuts
over these and marinate with French Dressing, using lemon and orange
juice, also some of the fine orange pulp, in place of vinegar. Sprinkle

YANKEE PLUM PUDDING

          2/3 cup Cottolene.
          1 cup N. O. molasses.
          3 cups flour.
          1-1/2 teaspoons soda.
          1 teaspoon cinnamon.
          1/2 teaspoon cloves.
          1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1 cup sweet milk.
          1 cup seeded shredded raisins.
          1 cup English Walnut meats broken in pieces.

PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add molasses; mix and sift flour, soda, spices
and salt; add alternately with milk, reserving enough flour to dredge

PROCESS: Scald a granite-ware coffeepot. Beat egg slightly and dilute
with one-half cup cold water, add to coffee and mix thoroughly. Turn
into coffeepot and add boiling water, stir well. Place on range; let
boil five minutes. If not boiled sufficiently, coffee will not be clear;
if boiled too long, the tannic acid will be extracted, causing serious
gastric trouble. Stuff the spout of pot with soft paper to prevent the
escape of aroma. Stir down, pour off one cup to clear the spout of
grounds, return to pot. Add remaining half-cup cold water to complete
the clearing process. Place pot on back of range for ten minutes, where
coffee will not boil. Serve immediately. If coffee must be kept longer,
drain from the grounds and keep just below boiling point.

last half hour of cooking. Drain and reheat in White Sauce or dress with
melted butter, pepper and more salt if needed. If canned beans are used
(and they would be in some localities at this season of the year) turn
them from the can into sauce-pan and reheat them in their own liquor.
Drain and dress them with melted butter, salt, and pepper.


CABBAGE SALAD

Use only the center of a firm head of white cabbage. Shred it very fine
and cover with ice water until crisp. Drain thoroughly and mix with one

TOMATO SOUP

          1 can tomatoes, or 1 quart tomatoes peeled and cut in pieces.
          2 slices onion.
          2 sprays parsley.
          Bit of bay leaf.
          4 cloves.
          1/2 teaspoon peppercorns.
          Few gratings nutmeg.
          3 tablespoons butter.
          2 tablespoons flour.
          Salt, pepper, cayenne.

PROCESS: Cook the first six ingredients together twenty minutes. Rub
through a purée strainer, keep hot. Melt butter in a sauce-pan, add
flour and stir to a smooth paste, let cook one minute; dilute with
tomato mixture to the consistency to pour. Combine mixtures and season
with salt, a few grains cayenne and a grating of nutmeg. Reheat and
serve with crisp, toasted Saratoga Wafers.


ROAST GUINEA FOWL

Clean, singe, draw and truss in the same way as for roasting chicken.
Stuff if desired. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay very thin slices of
fat salt pork over the breast, wings and legs. Place in a covered
roasting pan, pour in one-half cup water, set in oven and roast from
forty-five minutes to one hour (continue cooking if liked well done),
turning so as to brown evenly. (When the roasting pan is used there need
be no basting.) If roasted in an open dripping-pan, baste every ten to
fifteen minutes. The flesh of this bird is dry and is therefore best
cooked rare. Serve as roast chicken. Prepare sauce same as Giblet Sauce.
(See Page 154.)


RHUBARB SAUCE

The young, tender stalks of rhubarb need only be washed, tops and root
cut off, then cut in one-inch pieces (without peeling). Put in a
sauce-pan, add just enough water to prevent burning. Cook slowly until
soft. Add sugar to sweeten to taste, cook five minutes, cool and turn
into serving dish.


POTATO SOUFFLÉS

Select six medium-sized, rather flat potatoes. Wash, pare and trim them
square, then cut lengthwise in slices one-eighth of an inch thick (no
thicker). Wash and dry them on a towel. Drop a few at a time into hot
Cottolene (not smoking hot), fry them four minutes, turning them
occasionally. Remove with skimmer to a croquette basket, let stand five
minutes while the fat is heating. When hot enough to brown an inch cube
of bread in forty seconds, place the basket containing potatoes into
fat, shake constantly and fry two minutes. Drain on brown paper. Repeat
process until all potatoes are used. Sprinkle with salt and dispose
around roasted Guinea Fowl.


EGG-PLANT SAUTÉ (WITH FINE HERBS)

Pare a medium-sized egg-plant, cut in very thin slices, sprinkle with
salt and pile in a colander. Cover with a plate and weights to press out
the acrid juice; let stand two hours, sprinkle with pepper, dredge with
flour, and sauté in hot butter until crisp and a golden brown. Mix
together one-half teaspoon each finely chopped parsley and chives,
one-fourth teaspoon very finely chopped chervil and sprinkle lightly
over egg-plant as soon as crisp. Arrange on hot serving dish and serve
at once.


DRESSED HEAD LETTUCE

Remove the outer green leaves from two medium-sized heads of crisp head
lettuce. Wash carefully, without separating the leaves; drain dry in a
wire basket or on towels. Cut heads in halves lengthwise and arrange in
salad bowl. Set aside in a cool place, and, just before serving, pour
over French Dressing. Serve at once.


ORANGE ICE

          4 cups water.
          2-1/2 cups sugar.
          2 cups orange juice.
          1/2 cup lemon juice.
          Rind of two oranges.

PROCESS: Pare the rind as thinly as possible from two oranges; add to
water and sugar, and cook twenty minutes. Remove rind, add fruit juice,
strain, cool and freeze. Serve in stem glasses.


CHOCOLATE JUMBLES

          1/3 cup Cottolene.
          1 cup sugar.
          2 squares chocolate grated.
          1 tablespoon milk or water.
          2 eggs beaten thick and light.
          2 teaspoons baking powder.
          2 cups flour.
          1/4 teaspoon salt.
          1 teaspoon vanilla.

PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add
chocolate, milk and eggs. Mix and sift flour, baking powder and salt;
add to first mixture. Add more flour if necessary. Dough should be soft.
Toss on a floured board, roll out to one-half inch thickness, shape with

CHICKEN BOUILLON CHANTILLY

Pour six cups of hot, well-seasoned Chicken Bouillon into hot bouillon
cups. Drop on top of each portion one tablespoon whipped cream
delicately seasoned with salt, pepper and a few grains cayenne. Sprinkle
cream with paprika or finely chopped chives.


FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN

Dress, singe, clean and cut two young chickens in pieces for serving.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour, brown richly in
equal parts of Cottolene and butter, turning often that pieces may be
evenly browned. Then cover with boiling water to which add a bit of bay
leaf, one-half teaspoon peppercorns, a spray of parsley, six slices
carrot and three slices onion. Cover and simmer until chicken is tender
(from one to one and one-quarter hours). Remove chicken from stock,
cover and keep warm; strain stock; there should be two cups. Melt four
tablespoons butter in a sauce pan, add four tablespoons flour, stir to a
paste, then gradually pour on the two cups hot stock, stirring
constantly; let simmer ten minutes. Remove from range, add one cup of
hot cream and the yolks of two eggs slightly beaten. Reheat chicken in
sauce (do not allow sauce to boil after adding yolks). Serve with
Waffles.


SPINACH WITH DEVILED EGGS

          1 peck spinach.
          1/4 pound bacon.
          Salt, pepper.
          1/3 cup butter.
          Few grains nutmeg.
          5 hard-cooked eggs.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1/4 teaspoon pepper.
          1/2 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.
          1/2 teaspoon grated onion.
          1/2 cup minced ham.
          Cream Salad Dressing.

PROCESS: Cook spinach in the usual way. Cook the bacon with spinach to
give it flavor. When spinach is tender, remove bacon, drain spinach and
chop fine. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add butter, mix well and
pack into an oval mold. Keep hot over hot water, cut eggs in halves
lengthwise, remove yolks and rub through a sieve. Add ham, salt, pepper,
parsley and onion juice. Moisten with Cream Salad Dressing to bind
mixture together. Refill halves of eggs with this mixture, heaping it
pyramid-like. Turn mold of spinach on hot serving dish and surround with
stuffed eggs.


PRUNE AND NUT SALAD

Buy very select prunes for this purpose (tins holding one or two pounds
are best), cook prunes in the usual way, letting the liquor evaporate
during the latter part of cooking. Prunes should not be as well done as
when serving them as sauce. Drain prunes from the liquor and chill them.
Remove the stones carefully, cut prunes in five pieces lengthwise. Cut
pecan nut meats in four pieces lengthwise. Mix prunes and nut meats,
sprinkle with salt and paprika. For one-half pound prunes and one-fourth
pound shelled nut meats allow one cup whipping cream. Whip cream until
solid, season with one-half teaspoon each salt and paprika; add two
tablespoons lemon juice and one and one-half tablespoons Sherry wine
slowly, while beating constantly. Mix two-thirds of the cream with the
prunes and nuts. Arrange the heart leaves of lettuce on cold, individual
salad plates, pile some of the mixture in each and mask with remaining
whipped cream. Arrange three pieces of prunes on top of each portion,
radiating from center, and place a cherry or strawberry on top of each.

range and stir until mixture begins to boil. When syrup drops from the
wooden spoon thick like honey, remove from range and add eight
tablespoons of the syrup to the stiffly beaten whites of eggs, beating
constantly. Return remaining syrup to range, continue cooking until
syrup spins a thread at least five inches in length. Pour syrup in a
thin stream onto first mixture and beat until cool and slightly glazed

rhubarb in one-inch pieces. Put into baking dish and sprinkle generously
with sugar, add just enough water to prevent rhubarb from burning. Cover
and bake in oven very slowly until tender but not broken. (Slow cooking
preserves its color.) One cup of Sultana raisins may be cooked with
rhubarb. They must, however, be first picked over, stems removed, then
covered with boiling water, drained, then covered again with boiling
water and cooked until soft. Arrange a layer of rhubarb in baking dish,
then a sprinkle of raisins and sugar and thus continue until all are
used. Finish cooking as directed in the foregoing. Serve very cold.

seasonings, spinach pulp; cook five minutes and serve with cream,
whipped stiff. Sprinkle each portion with finely chopped parsley.


YOUNG PIGEONS STUFFED AND BRAISED

Clean, stuff and truss six _young_ pigeons. Arrange them in a stew pan
or Dutch oven. Add one quart boiling water; add three blades celery, cut
in pieces, and three slices of onion, a small bit of bay leaf and
one-half teaspoon peppercorns. Cover closely and simmer (in the oven if
Dutch oven is used) slowly, until birds are tender (about two hours

water that clings to the leaves (if spinach is old, cook it in plenty of
water), until soft. Drain dry as possible and chop finely. Season with
salt, pepper and Tarragon vinegar. Cut bacon in shreds crosswise, then
cut shreds in small bits. Sauté them until delicately browned and crisp,
skim them from the fat, add them to spinach, add one tablespoon of bacon
fat. Butter lightly small Dairole molds and pack solidly with spinach.

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS

(For recipe see Page 66.)


BRAISED CALF'S LIVER

Wipe liver and skewer into shape, if necessary. Draw small lardoons
through the liver, in parallel rows, leaving each lardoon extend
one-half inch above surface. Place liver in a casserole or Dutch oven,
surround with remnants of lardoons. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and
dredge with flour. Surround with one-third cup each of carrots, onion
and celery, cut in small cubes; add one-half teaspoon peppercorns, six
cloves, one spray parsley, a bit of bay leaf and two cups hot Brown
Stock or water. Cover closely and cook in a slow oven two hours. Remove
cover the last half hour of cooking that liver may brown richly. Remove
liver to serving platter, set aside in a warm place. Strain liquor in
casserole and use for making a Brown Sauce. Pour sauce around liver and
serve. Braised liver may be served cold, thinly sliced.


RICE AU GRATIN

          1-1/2 cups steamed or boiled rice.
          1 tablespoon salt.
          1-1/2 tablespoons butter.
          1/3 lb. grated cheese.
          Cayenne.
          Milk.
          Buttered cracker crumbs.

PROCESS: When steaming or boiling the rice, allow one tablespoon of salt
for seasoning. Butter a baking dish and cover with a layer of rice, dot
over with some of the butter. Sprinkle with a thin layer of cheese and a
slight sprinkle cayenne; repeat alternate layers until rice and cheese
are used. Pour on milk to half the depth of baking dish, cover with
buttered cracker crumbs and bake in oven until cheese melts and crumbs
are brown.


CARROTS AND TURNIPS IN CREAM SAUCE

Scrub, scrape and cut carrots in small cubes. Wash, pare and cut
purple-top turnips the same. (There should be one and one-half cups of
each.) Cover each (in separate vessels) with boiling water and cook
until tender; add salt the last half hour of cooking. Drain well, toss
together and reheat in one and one-half cups Thin White Sauce.


ASPARAGUS SALAD

Cook asparagus in the usual way, drain and slip three or four spears
through an onion ring just large enough to hold them. Arrange these
fagots in nests of crisp lettuce heart leaves. Just before serving pour
over French Dressing to which has been added one tablespoon of finely
chopped chives. A band of red or green pepper may be used in place of
the onion ring. Canned asparagus should first be drained from the liquor
in the can then rinsed with cold water. Chilled and served as directed
in the foregoing.


CUSTARD PIE

Line a deep, perforated pie tin with Plain or Rich Paste. For filling,
beat three eggs slightly, add one-fourth cup sugar, one-eighth teaspoon
salt, one-eighth teaspoon nutmeg, and pour over slowly two cups scalded
milk, stirring constantly. Bake in a hot oven at first, to set the crust
or rim, then reduce the heat afterwards; as this is a combination of
eggs and milk it should be finished in a slow oven.

          1 onion sliced.
          1 green pepper cut in shreds.
          2 cups hot cream or milk.
          1/4 cup butter.
          2 tablespoons flour.
          Salt, cayenne and nutmeg.
          1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.

green pepper (discarding seeds and veins). Cook until rice is soft; rub
through a sieve. Melt butter in a saucepan, add flour, stir to a smooth
paste, add cream slowly, stirring constantly. Add seasonings and cook
over hot water ten minutes. Combine with rice mixture, continue cooking
five minutes. Turn into hot soup tureen and sprinkle over with parsley.


FLANK STEAK STUFFED AND BRAISED

Select a flank steak weighing about two and one-half pounds. Have the
butcher peel off the superfluous fat and tissue and score both sides
diagonally in opposite directions. Remove the steak from paper when it
comes from market and lay it flat on meat board, sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Spread over it a thin layer of stuffing, (see Page 154), roll
lengthwise, very compactly, sew the overlapping edge securely, also the
ends. Sprinkle roll with salt, pepper and dredge with flour. Place meat
in pan with enough Cottolene to brown it richly, turning roll until it
is richly browned all over. Then remove to Dutch oven or casserole;
rinse dripping pan with a little boiling water, pour over meat and
surround with two cups stewed and strained tomato pulp, one onion thinly
sliced, one green pepper shredded (after removing seeds and veins), two
sprays parsley, the half of a small bay leaf and two tablespoons
Worcestershire sauce. Cover closely, place in oven and cook meat very
slowly about three to four hours. Remove meat to serving platter. Dilute
four tablespoons flour with cold water to the consistency to pour, add
to sauce in pan, stir until well blended, season with salt and pepper;
let simmer ten minutes, then strain around meat. Garnish with sprays of
parsley or cress.


DANDELION GREENS

Remove the roots, carefully pick over (discarding all tough and wilted
leaves) and wash dandelion leaves in several waters; to the last water
add salt to free leaves from insects and vermin. It will require one
peck of leaves to serve a family of six. Cook leaves in plenty of
boiling salted water until tender; drain at once and chop fine. Dress
with butter and pepper; cut thin slices of bacon in shreds crosswise,
try it out and pour over dandelions. (There should be one-third cup
bacon fat.) The shreds of bacon are an attractive garnish; hard-cooked
eggs may also be used as a garnish. Cut them in eighths or rings.
Vinegar is sometimes added. Serve hot.

          2 tablespoons vinegar.
          Garlic.

PROCESS: Rub the mixing bowl with a bruised clove of garlic; add salt,
pepper, paprika and oil; beat until ingredients are thoroughly blended,
adding vinegar slowly meanwhile. A piece of ice put into bowl while
stirring will aid in chilling the mixture.


CURRANT PIE

          2-1/2 cups cleaned currants.
          2 cups sugar.
          1/8 teaspoon salt.
          2 eggs slightly beaten.
          2 tablespoons flour.

PROCESS: Mix the ingredients in the order given. Turn in a lined pie
pan, heaping currants in center; cover with top crust, press and flute
the edges. Bake as other berry pies. Serve hot. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar.


CHERRY PUNCH

Boil two cups sugar and one cup water until a rich syrup is formed. Add
one cup of lemon juice and two cups of Cherry juice, left over when
canning cherries. (This left-over juice may be brought to the boiling
point, skimmed and turned into sterilized fruit jars, sealed and stored
as canned fruit and may be used for punch or pudding sauce.) Add two
cups cold water. Fill a claret pitcher with cracked ice; add mixture.
When serving, place a thin slice of orange, three or four strawberries
and three pitted California cherries in each glass, fill three-fourths
full with mixture. Serve very cold.

add stock slowly, stirring constantly; add cream and continue stirring.
Bring to boiling point, remove from range and add egg yolk slightly
beaten. Add seasonings. Beat until smooth and glossy. Keep hot over hot
water. Do not allow sauce to boil after adding yolk of egg.


LETTUCE WITH CREAM DRESSING

Pick over, wash thoroughly young tender lettuce; cut off the roots and
drain. Beat one-half cup heavy cream until solid. Add two tablespoons
vinegar diluted with one tablespoon cold water. Add one tablespoon

(For recipe see Page 66.)


CROUTONS

Cut stale bread in one-third inch slices; remove crusts and cut in
one-third inch strips, cut strips in one-third inch cubes. Fry them a
golden brown in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle
lightly with salt.


ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB

Order a shoulder and fore-leg of lamb, boned. Wipe, stuff and truss in
shape. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and dredge with flour. Place on rack
in dripping pan, put in hot oven and baste with dripping melted in one
cup hot water, as soon as flour begins to brown; continue basting every
fifteen minutes until meat is done, which will require about two hours;
add one cup of stock to pan while meat is cooking. When richly browned
cover closely and finish cooking.

To carve a boned leg of lamb, cut in thin slices across the grain,
beginning at top of shoulder. When trussed in shape meat looks like a
goose without wings or legs.

STUFFING FOR LAMB

(See recipe Page 154 for stuffing, adding 3/4 teaspoon poultry
seasoning.)

MINT SAUCE

          1 bunch of mint finely chopped.
          1/3 cup vinegar.
          2 tablespoons cold water.
          2 tablespoons powdered sugar.

PROCESS: Dilute vinegar with cold water, add sugar and stir until sugar
is dissolved, pour over mint (there should be four tablespoons of mint),
place on back of range and infuse for one-half hour.


NEW POTATOES WITH NEW PEAS

Prepare potatoes as for New Potatoes with Chive Sauce (see recipe Page
78), omitting the Chives. Cook one cup of new peas until tender, in as
little boiling salted water as possible. Drain; add to potatoes. Reheat
potatoes and peas in Cream Sauce.


SWISS CHARD WITH BACON

Wash and pick over Swiss Chard. Cook in boiling salted water, using just
enough water to prevent Chard from burning. Drain and chop fine. Arrange
in a mound on a chop platter, surround (crown fashion) with
"hard-boiled" eggs cut in halves lengthwise, having cut side out. Cut a
slice off the large end of each egg so that they will stay in place. Cut
five slices of bacon in narrow strips crosswise. Try out one-third cup.
Add one-fourth cup vinegar, diluted with one-fourth cup hot water, pour
while hot over the Swiss Chard, scattering the scraps of bacon over top
of mound.


CHERRY DUFF

          4 cups pitted cherries.
          2 cups sugar.
          1 teaspoon lemon juice.
          1-1/2 tablespoons Cottolene.
          2 cups flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1 teaspoon salt.
          3/4 cup milk or thin cream.

PROCESS: Mix and sift flour, baking powder and salt; rub Cottolene in

CHICKEN CONSOMMÉ (COLD)

Place a four-pound fowl in stock pot and a small knuckle of veal; add
four quarts of cold water and heat slowly to boiling point. Skim, reduce
heat and let simmer five hours. Do not allow liquid to boil as it will
destroy its gelatinous properties, and the stock will be turbid. The
last hour of cooking add one-third cup each celery, carrot and turnip
cut in small dice, one-third cup sliced onion, one teaspoon peppercorns,
one tablespoon salt, three sprays thyme, one spray marjoram, two sprays
parsley, one-half bay leaf. Remove fowl and knuckle; strain soup through
double cheese cloth, cool quickly, and remove all fat; clear. Fill
Bouillon cups three-fourths full and chill. This should be a clear,
savory jelly.

TO CLEAR SOUP STOCK

After straining the stock through double cheese cloth, remove all fat
and put the stock into a four-quart stew-pan. Place on range and allow
the white and shell of one egg for each quart of stock. Beat the eggs
slightly and crush shells in small bits, add slowly to stock, stirring
constantly but slowly until the boiling point is reached; let boil two
minutes. Reduce the heat so that stock barely simmers twenty minutes,
skim and strain through double cheese cloth placed over fine soup
strainer. If stock to be cleared is not sufficiently seasoned, add more
seasoning before clearing.


VEAL LOAF

Wipe three pounds of lean veal, discarding all skin and tissue. Pass
meat through the meat-chopper twice, with one-half pound of salt pork;
add six crackers rolled, one-fourth cup cream, juice of one small lemon
(about two tablespoons), one tablespoon salt, one-half tablespoon black
pepper, onion juice to taste. Mix thoroughly and pack solidly in a
granite, brick-shaped bread pan, spread top evenly and brush with
slightly beaten white of egg. Bake in a moderate oven three hours,
basting often with one-fourth cup of pork fat or dripping diluted with
one-fourth cup boiling water. Prick surface with a fork that fat may
penetrate meat. Chill, remove to serving platter, surround by any good
vegetable salad. If served hot, surround with Tomato, Creole or
Espagnole Sauce. This may be prepared Saturday.


STRING BEAN SALAD

Marinate cold, cooked, stringless beans with French Dressing. There
should be enough beans to make a generous border around a cold veal
loaf. Sprinkle beans thickly with small onions thinly sliced and the
rings separated. Garnish edge of dish with sprays of parsley and
Nasturtium blossoms. The finely chopped seed-cells may also be sprinkled
over beans and is quite an addition.


SARATOGA CHIPS

Wash and pare the desired number of uniform-sized potatoes. Slice thinly
(using slaw cutter) into a bowl of cold water. Let stand several hours,
changing the water often or until it is quite clear. Drain and drop them
into a kettle of boiling water; allow them to boil just one minute.
Drain quickly and cover with cold water. Drain from cold water and dry
between towels. Fry a few at a time in deep hot Cottolene, keeping them
moving with the skimmer. Drain on soft brown paper and sprinkle with
salt.


BEETS IN DRAWN BUTTER

Wash the small new beets and cook in boiling salted water until tender.
Drain and cover with cold water. Rub off the skins and slice them or cut
them in cubes. Reheat them in

DRAWN BUTTER (SOUR SAUCE)

Melt two tablespoons butter in a sauce-pan; add three tablespoons flour,
stir to a smooth paste and add gradually, while stirring constantly, one
cup boiling water. Boil two minutes, then add four tablespoons hot cream
and four tablespoons vinegar (if vinegar is too acid use two tablespoons
each of vinegar and water), season with salt and pepper.


FIGS IN SHERRY JELLY

          1 tablespoon granulated gelatine.
          1/4 cup cold water.
          3/4 cup boiling water.
          1/2 cup best table Sherry wine.
          Juice of 1 small lemon.
          1/2 dozen washed figs.
          Whipped Cream.
          1/2 cup sugar.

PROCESS: Soak gelatine in cold water, then dissolve it in boiling water;
add sugar and stir occasionally until mixture begins to thicken, then
add wine and lemon juice. Chill a pint mold in ice water (a fancy mold
is attractive for this purpose). Separate the figs, slice them thinly
and dip some of them in the jelly and use them for decorating the mold;
then fill the mold with alternate layers of sliced figs and the mixture,
allowing the jelly to "set" each time before adding the slices of figs.
Chill thoroughly. Unmold jelly on serving dish and surround with whipped
cream sweetened and flavored as desired. Use pastry bag and rose tube
for this purpose.


NUT AND RAISIN CAKE

          1/3 cup Cottolene.
          1 cup fine sugar.
          3 eggs unbeaten.
          1 cup pecan nut meats.
          2/3 cup raisins.
          2 cups pastry flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          3/4 cup milk.
          Grated rind of half an orange.
          1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.
          1/4 teaspoon mace.
          1/4 teaspoon salt.

PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add
eggs, one at a time and beating each in thoroughly before adding
another. Pass nuts and raisins through meat chopper, then mix with flour
sifted with baking powder, salt and spices; add alternately to first
mixture with milk, beating constantly. Turn mixture into a well-greased
tube pan and bake thirty-five to forty minutes in a moderate oven.
Spread with

CARAMEL FROSTING WITH NUTS

          1-1/4 cups soft brown sugar.
          1/4 cup granulated sugar.
          1/2 cup boiling water.
          Whites 2 eggs.
          1/2 teaspoon almond extract.
          1/2 cup pecan nut meats broken in pieces.

PROCESS: Boil sugar and water together as for Boiled Frosting (see
recipe Page 56). Pour slowly onto beaten whites of eggs, beating
constantly, continue beating until frosting is nearly cool. Put pan
containing frosting in a larger vessel of boiling water, place on range
and cook until mixture granulates around sides of pan, stir constantly
while cooking. Remove from hot water and beat until frosting will keep
its shape when dropped from spoon. Add nut meats and flavoring. Spread
on cake, using wooden spoon to give surface a wave-like appearance.


ICED COFFEE

Follow directions for making Boiled Coffee, using four cups boiling
water. Chill and serve in tall glasses filled with cracked ice; add
cream and sugar.

NOVA SCOTIA CANAPÉS

Cut white bread in one-third inch slices; stamp out with heart-shaped
cutter; spread both sides thinly with butter, brown them delicately in
the oven. Mince Nova Scotia smoked salmon and moisten with Mayonnaise or
Boiled Salad Dressing. Spread each heart with mixture, dispose a dainty
border of finely chopped white of egg around each and tip it off with a
sprinkle of the yolk pressed through a sieve. Do not cover the salmon
entirely with the egg. Arrange canapés on small plates covered with a
lace paper doily; garnish each with a spray of parsley and serve as
first course.


PAN BROILED FILLETS OF BEEF

Have fillets of beef cut one and one-half inches thick; shape in
circular forms. Broil ten minutes in a hissing, well-buttered frying
pan, turning every ten seconds for the first two minutes, that the
surface may be seared thoroughly, thus preventing the loss of juices.
Turn occasionally afterward. When half done season with salt, pepper,
reduce heat and finish cooking. Arrange on hot serving platter and
spread generously with soft butter. Pour over Sultana Sauce. (For recipe
see Page 61.)

Wash and pare one dozen small, uniform-sized potatoes; soak one hour in
cold water to cover. Drain, put in stew-pan and cover with one quart of
boiling water. Add two tablespoons butter and two teaspoons salt. Cook
until soft (but not broken), then drain. Return to stew-pan. Add
one-third cup butter, one and one-half tablespoons lemon juice, and
one-eighth teaspoon paprika. Cook four or five minutes, shaking the pan
occasionally. Place in hot serving dish and sprinkle with one tablespoon
chopped parsley.


PEAS AND ONIONS--FRENCH STYLE

Cut one slice bacon in shreds crosswise, using the shears for this
purpose. Cook bacon with one-fourth cup butter about ten minutes,
without scorching bacon. Remove scraps of bacon, add two cups fresh
peas, one dozen small onions and a sprig of mint. Cook until peas and
onions are soft, adding one-fourth cup boiling water to prevent
scorching. Beat one egg yolk slightly, add one-third cup cream and one
head of lettuce cut in quarters (use lettuce hearts), season with salt
and pepper. Let boil up once and serve.


LETTUCE, PEPPERGRASS AND ONION SALAD

Separate the heart leaves of two solid heads of lettuce. Wash, drain and
chill; arrange them in a nest in salad bowl. Sprinkle between and over
leaves four tablespoons finely chopped peppergrass and small, thinly
sliced onions, separating the rings. Marinate with French Dressing;
chill and serve.


PEACH ICE CREAM No. 2

BROILED CHICKEN

Singe, wipe and with a sharp pointed knife (a boning knife) split the
broiler down the back the entire length, beginning at back of neck. Lay
open and remove entrails, etc., remove ribs and breast-bone, then cut
the tendons at joints. Rub bird over with soft butter, sprinkle with
salt and place on a well-greased broiler or in a well-greased wire
broiler. Cook twenty-five minutes under a gas flame or over glowing
coals, turning often. Baste bird over several times with melted butter
if it appears dry. When evenly browned, remove to well-greased dripping
pan, spread again with soft butter, cover closely, and bake until tender
at the joints. Serve with

SAUCE VIENNAISE

Reduce one small can of tomatoes by slow cooking to a thick pulp; when
strained there should be two tablespoons. To three-fourths cup
Mayonnaise Dressing add three-fourths tablespoon finely chopped capers,
one teaspoon finely chopped parsley, two teaspoons each finely chopped
gherkins and olives, one teaspoon finely chopped onion or chives. Add
tomato pulp, mix well and keep in a cool place until ready to serve.


MASHED POTATOES (FOR ROSES)

To three cups of hot riced potatoes add three tablespoons butter, one
teaspoon salt, the beaten yolks of three eggs and enough hot milk to
allow the mixture to pass readily through the pastry-bag with rose tube
attached. Shape as roses on a buttered tin sheet, brush over lightly
with egg slightly beaten and diluted with one tablespoon milk, and brown
delicately in oven.

TO SHAPE ROSES

Fill pastry bag with potato mixture. Hold the bag upright with tube
pointing downward. Guide tube with left hand and press out potato with
the right, making a circular motion. When roses are the desired size
press the tube gently into mixture and withdraw it quickly to stop the
flow and give the pyramid a pointed finish. Sweet potatoes may be
prepared in the same manner.

Drain well and dispose on shallow serving dish. Pour over one and
one-half cups Béchamel Sauce (see Page 85). Sprinkle with finely chopped
parsley.


DRESSED HEAD LETTUCE

Select a large, firm head of lettuce. Remove all wilted leaves. Separate
the heart leaves sufficiently to wash them thoroughly. Drain, arrange
leaves on shallow serving plate, keeping them in their original shape if
possible. Sprinkle over all finely shredded red and green prepared
peppers. (To prepare peppers, plunge them into boiling water, then
quickly rub off the glazed outer skin, drop peppers into cold water
until crisp. Cut a slice from the stem ends, remove seeds and veins,
then cut in thread like rings.) Serve with French Dressing, to which add
one tablespoon Roquefort cheese. Blend well before pouring over Salad.

          2 cups pastry flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          4 tablespoons Cottolene.
          Yolk 1 egg.
          White 1 egg slightly beaten.
          Granulated sugar.
          Ground cloves.

PROCESS: Cook blackberries in water and salt until berries are soft. Rub
through a sieve and add sugar to pulp; return to range and cook until
mixture thickens, stirring occasionally. Sift flour with baking powder
and salt, work in Cottolene with tips of fingers, and mix to a soft
dough with yolk of egg mixed with one-half cup of milk. Turn onto a
floured board, knead slightly and roll out in a rectangular sheet
one-fourth inch thick. Divide this into four pieces, longer than wide.
Spread each with the blackberry sauce and roll up like jelly roll; wet
the edges, press lightly to prevent unrolling. Lay on buttered sheet and
brush tops with white of egg, sprinkle with sugar and a few grains
cloves. Bake twenty-five minutes in a hot oven. Serve hot with remaining
sauce kept hot over hot water or with

          1/4 cup butter.
          2/3 cup powdered sugar.
          2 tablespoons milk.
          2 tablespoons Sherry wine.
          Few grains nutmeg.

PROCESS: Cream butter, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add
milk and wine very slowly, continue beating. Add a sprinkle of nutmeg.
To avoid having sauce curdle, milk and wine must be added drop by drop.

BOILED HALIBUT--COLD

Have a piece of Halibut cut weighing two and one-half pounds. Tie in a
square of cheese cloth (to prevent scum from settling on the flesh of
fish). Cover with boiling water to which add salt and vinegar or lemon
juice; the acid preserves the whiteness of the fish. Boil until the
flesh leaves the bones (about thirty-five minutes). Drain and remove
from cheese cloth. Pick out bones and remove skin. Place in a vessel
that will preserve the shape of fish, chill and dispose fish on a cold
serving platter on a bed of garden cress. Set a cucumber basket at
intervals (one for each guest), and serve with

VINAIGRETTE SAUCE

          1 teaspoon salt.
          1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
          Few grains cayenne.
          1 tablespoon Tarragon vinegar.
          2 tablespoons Malt vinegar.
          1/2 cup Olive oil.
          1 tablespoon chopped olives.
          1 tablespoon chopped pickle.
          1 tablespoon chopped green or red pepper.
          1 teaspoon chopped parsley.
          1-1/2 teaspoons chopped chives.

PROCESS: Put salt, pepper and cayenne in bowl, add oil slowly stirring
constantly, add remaining ingredients and blend thoroughly. Chill and
pour over Boiled Halibut.


CUCUMBER BASKETS

Select long cucumbers of uniform thickness (three cucumbers will make
six baskets), cut a slice from both the stem and blossom ends, pare and
cut in halves crosswise; cut from each piece a section so as to form a
handle crosswise of cucumber. Scoop out the soft pulp and seeds, brush
each basket over lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with finely chopped
garden cress or parsley. Fill the baskets with Mayonnaise Dressing or
Sauce Tartare (see recipe Page 84). Chill and serve in nests of
peppergrass or lettuce heart leaves.


FRENCH FRIED POTATOES

Wash and pare medium-sized potatoes, cut them lengthwise in eight pieces
of a uniform size. Soak them in cold water two hours, changing the water
several times. Drain from water and dry between towels. Then fry a few
at a time in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with
salt. This is an easy method of preparing potatoes in hot weather. The
potatoes may be prepared beforehand and the process of cooking is both
simply and quickly done. Be sure the Cottolene is not too hot as the
potatoes must be cooked through, as well as browned.


BOILED SWEET CORN

Have the water boiling. Remove the husks and silk from the corn and drop
them at once into the boiling water; bring water quickly to boiling
point and let boil rapidly five to ten minutes (depending somewhat on
age of corn). Drain from water and arrange in a napkin-covered platter;
serve at once.


FROZEN APRICOTS

Drain the apricots from the liquor in the can. Reserve liquor and cut
fruit in one-fourth inch cubes. To the syrup add sufficient water to
make four cups; add one cup orange juice; add one and one-half cups
sugar. Cook five minutes, strain and pour over apricots; chill and
freeze. Fresh apricots or peaches may be used when in season. The fresh
fruit should be cooked until clear, in a syrup made of four cups of
water and two cups sugar. When this mixture is frozen to a mush, two
cups of Whipped Cream may be added, if one desires a richer dessert.


SULTANA CAKE

          1/3 cup Cottolene.
          1 cup sugar.
          2 eggs.
          1 egg yolk.
          1 cup Sultana raisins.
          1/2 cup milk.
          2-1/4 cups pastry flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1/4 teaspoon salt.
          1/2 teaspoon mace.

PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly; add
well-beaten eggs and yolk. Mix and sift flour (except one tablespoon),
baking powder and salt and mace; add to first mixture alternately with
milk. Dredge raisins with tablespoon flour, add to mixture and beat
thoroughly. Turn mixture into a well-greased, brick-shaped bread pan and
bake forty minutes in a moderate oven. Frost if desired.

          1 small clove garlic.
          1 truffle cut in thin shreds.
          1 can small button mushrooms.
          1-1/2 cups thick, well-seasoned tomato pulp.
          1-1/4 cups Brown Stock.

browning; add flour and cook two minutes, stirring constantly. Add
truffle, tomato pulp and gradually Brown Stock; continue stirring until
ingredients are well blended. Heat mushrooms in their own liquor, drain,
and add mushrooms to sauce. Stick a tooth-pick through the clove of
garlic, drop it into sauce and let it simmer fifteen minutes. Remove
garlic before serving.


POTATO BALLS

Add to five hot mashed potatoes, one-fourth teaspoon celery salt, one
teaspoon finely chopped parsley or chives, salt, pepper and three
tablespoons butter, and enough hot milk to make of the consistency to
handle. Shape into smooth, round balls, roll in flour, egg and crumbs.

SPINACH WITH CREAM

Discard all wilted leaves, remove the roots and pick over and wash
one-half peck of spinach in several waters, to rid it from all sand. If
young and tender, put in a stew-pan and heat gradually; let boil
twenty-five minutes, or until soft, in its own juices and the water that
clung to the leaves. Old spinach should be cooked in boiling, salted
water (it will require about two quarts of water to one peck spinach).
Drain thoroughly, chop finely in a wooden bowl. Melt three tablespoons
butter in an omelet pan; add spinach and cook four minutes, stirring
constantly, sprinkle with one and one-half tablespoons flour, continue
stirring and pour on gradually three-fourths cup hot, thin cream; simmer
five minutes.

          1-1/4 tablespoons butter.
          1 tablespoon lemon juice.
          Grated rind 1/4 lemon.

PROCESS: Line a pie pan with Plain Paste. Wipe, pare, core and cut
apples in quarters, then in slices lengthwise. Pile them in lined pie
pan, heaping them well in center, leaving a half-inch space around edge
of pie. Mix sugar, nutmeg, salt, lemon juice, grated rind and turn over
apples. Dot over with bits of butter; wet edges and cover with top
crust; press and flute edges. Bake forty-five minutes in a moderate
oven.

(reserving one and one-half tablespoons), with tips of fingers. Add just
enough ice water to form a soft dough, mixing it in with a knife. Turn
on a floured board and roll out in a thin sheet, spread lightly with
remaining Cottolene. Roll like jelly roll and cut in two pieces, having
one piece a trifle larger than the other. Chill. Then stand rolls on
end, press down with the hand and roll in circular piece to fit pie pan.
The larger piece is for the top crust. This recipe makes the exact
quantity of pastry for one medium-sized pie with two crusts. If desired,
omit baking powder.

Put two quarts thick sour milk in a milk pan, place it on the back of
range where it will not boil or simmer; allow it to remain there until
the curd has separated from the whey. Lay a double square of cheese
cloth over a bowl, turn in the milk, lift the edges and corners of
cloth, draw them together, tie with a piece of twine and hang it up to
drain. When quite dry, turn into a bowl; season with salt and mix with a
silver fork, add sweet cream until of the desired consistency. Serve

FRIED CHICKEN

Dress, clean and disjoint two chickens. Rub chicken over with a half
lemon cut in half lengthwise, sprinkle with salt, pepper and dredge with
flour. Sauté in hot Cottolene until richly browned, turning often.
Reduce heat, cover and let cook slowly until tender. It may be necessary
to add a little moisture (about 1/4 cup of hot stock or water). Remove
to serving platter and surround with Corn Fritters. Pass Cream Gravy.

CREAM GRAVY

          1/4 cup butter.
          1 slice onion.
          1/4 cup flour.
          1-1/2 cups well-seasoned chicken stock.
          1/2 cup hot cream.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1/8 teaspoon pepper.

PROCESS: Cook butter in a sauce-pan with onion until onion is delicately
browned. Remove onion, add flour mixed with seasonings; stir to a smooth
paste and brown lightly. Add hot stock gradually, stirring constantly.
Add hot cream and beat until smooth and glossy. The color of this sauce
is that of Café au Lait.


CORN FRITTERS

          2 cups grated corn.
          1/4 cup milk.
          1-1/3 cup flour.
          2 teaspoons sugar.
          1/3 cup melted butter.
          1 teaspoon salt.
          1/8 teaspoon pepper.
          3 eggs well beaten.

PROCESS: Mix corn, milk, flour, sugar and salt, add eggs. Drop by
tablespoonfuls on a hot well-greased griddle and cook as griddle cakes
until browned on one side; then turn and brown the other side.


CAULIFLOWER SALAD

Marinate a prepared cauliflower (see recipe on Page 95) with French
Dressing, to which add one tablespoon finely chopped chives. Dispose in
a nest of peppergrass, water cress, endive or lettuce heart leaves.

PEACH CAKE WITH SWEETENED CREAM

          2 cups flour.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          3 tablespoons Cottolene.
          3/4 cup rich milk.
          5 peaches.
          Sultana raisins.
          Mace and sugar.

PROCESS: Mix and sift the first three ingredients. Rub in Cottolene with
tips of fingers, add milk, mixing it in with a knife. This dough must be
soft enough to spread in a shallow, well-buttered pan to the depth of
one inch. (Add more milk if necessary.) Pare ripe, juicy peaches; cut in
halves lengthwise, remove stones and press halves into dough (cut side
up) in parallel rows, leaving a little space between rows. Brush peaches
over with melted butter, sprinkle with raisins, granulated sugar and
lightly with mace. Serve hot with Hard Sauce, or with cream sweetened

SHRIMP COCKTAILS

Allow one-fourth cup shrimps broken in pieces for each Cocktail. Season
with two tablespoons each tomato catsup, Sherry wine, one tablespoon
lemon juice, a few drops Tobasco Sauce, one-fourth teaspoon finely
chopped chives and salt to taste. Serve thoroughly chilled in Cocktail
glasses.


POTATO SOUP

          4 cups potatoes.
          1 large purple-top turnip.
          3 cups boiling water.
          3-1/2 cups scalded milk.
          1 onion sliced.
          1/4 cup butter.
          1/3 cup flour.
          2 teaspoons salt.
          1/8 teaspoon pepper.
          1/2 cup hot cream.
          Parsley.

PROCESS: Wash, pare and cut potatoes in one-fourth inch slices. Wash,
pare and cut turnip the same. Cover with boiling water and cook ten
minutes; drain, add onion and three cups boiling water. Cook until
vegetables are tender; drain and reserve water. Rub vegetables through
strainer, add water, add milk. Reheat and bind with butter and flour
cooked together. Add hot cream and seasonings. Turn into hot tureen and
sprinkle with finely chopped parsley.


BOILED FRESH COD

Wash and wipe a four-pound cut of fresh cod. Tie it loosely in a piece
of cheese cloth just large enough to cover fish. Place on a trivet in a
kettle, cover with boiling water, and add three slices onion, three
slices carrot, one spray parsley, a bit of bay leaf, three cloves, a
tablespoon salt and one-half cup vinegar. Bring quickly to the boiling
point, then reduce heat and simmer gently from twenty to thirty minutes.
Hard boiling breaks up the flakes of fish and toughens the fibre. Drain
from liquor, place fish on serving platter, remove the skin and pour a
few spoonfuls of Egg Sauce over the fish and the remainder around it.
Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over all, and garnish with hard-cooked
eggs cut to resemble pond lilies.

EGG SAUCE

          4 tablespoons butter.
          3 tablespoons flour.
          1 cup boiling water.
          1/2 cup hot cream.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1/8 teaspoon pepper.
          4 hard-cooked eggs.
          Parsley finely chopped.

PROCESS: Melt one-half the butter in a sauce-pan, add flour mixed with
seasonings, pour on slowly hot water, stirring constantly. Boil five
minutes, then add remaining butter in small bits. Continue stirring. Add
hot cream and two eggs chopped moderately. Garnish with remaining eggs.
Pour sauce around fish and sprinkle with parsley.


BOILED POTATOES

Wash, scrub and pare one dozen medium-sized potatoes. If old, let them
stand in cold water for several hours before paring, to freshen them.
Cover with cold water, heat to boiling point, cover and boil fifteen
minutes, then add salt, replace cover and cook until potatoes are soft
(about fifteen minutes longer). Drain perfectly dry and shake the
potatoes in a current of cold air. Place sauce-pan in a warm place,
cover with a crash towel until ready to serve. Serve as soon as
possible, if you would have a mealy potato.


SCALLOPED TOMATOES

Season one quart of canned tomatoes with one and a fourth teaspoons
salt, one-eighth teaspoon pepper, two tablespoons sugar, one-half
tablespoon grated onion and a few grains cayenne. Moisten one and
one-half cups of soft bread crumbs with one-half cup melted butter.
Butter a deep baking dish, sprinkle with a thick layer of crumbs. Pour
in tomato mixture and cover with remaining crumbs. Bake in the oven
until cooked throughout and crumbs are browned.


PICKLED BEETS

Prepare beets as for Buttered Beets (see Page 143). Cut them in slices
and lay them in a stone or glass jar. Allow one slice of onion for each
beet, one tablespoon grated horseradish, eight cloves and vinegar enough
to cover. Let stand twenty-four hours and they will be ready for use.
Beets thus prepared will not keep longer than a week. If vinegar is too
strong, dilute with one-fourth part cold water.


STEAMED PEACH PUDDING

Fill a two-quart mold two-thirds full of pared, stoned and sliced
peaches. Butter the inside edge of mold, also the inside of cover. Cover
with a soft dough made by mixing and sifting two cups flour, one-half
teaspoon salt and four teaspoons baking powder. Rub one tablespoon
Cottolene into flour mixture with tips of fingers, add sufficient rich
milk to make a soft dough. Sprinkle peaches with one-half cup sugar,
one-fourth teaspoon salt and dot over with one tablespoon butter cut in
small bits. Spread soft dough over all, cover closely and steam one
hour. Serve at once with

VANILLA SAUCE

          1 tablespoon corn-starch.
          1 cup sugar.
          1/8 teaspoon salt.
          2 cups boiling water.
          1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla.
          2 tablespoons butter.

PROCESS: Mix corn-starch, sugar and salt, add water slowly, stirring
constantly. Boil gently eight minutes, remove from range, add vanilla,
and butter in small bits; stir until well blended.

VEAL POT PIE WITH BAKED DUMPLINGS

Cut two pounds of veal from the leg in one-inch cubes. Add a fourth-inch
thick slice of salt pork, cut in very small cubes. Cover with boiling
water. Add one small carrot sliced, one stalk celery broken in pieces,
and two slices onion. When half done add one-half tablespoon salt. Cook
until meat is tender. Remove the meat and strain the broth; thicken
broth with flour diluted with cold water. Put meat into a baking dish
and pour over enough of the thickened broth to barely cover the meat.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make a soft dough by mixing and sifting

ROLLED RIB ROAST OF BEEF

Have the ribs removed, meat rolled and skewered in shape, from a
five-pound rib roast of beef, at the market, (have ribs and trimmings
sent with roast). Wipe meat, sprinkle with salt, pepper, dredge with
flour and arrange on rack in dripping pan. Place in a hot oven and, when
slightly brown, reduce heat and baste every ten minutes for the first
half hour with fat in pan, afterwards every fifteen minutes during
cooking. (If cooked rare it will require one hour and fifteen minutes.)

BROWN GRAVY

Drain and strain fat in the pan--return three tablespoons to dripping
pan, add four and one-half tablespoons flour and brown richly (do not
burn flour), add slowly one and one-half cups of Brown Stock or boiling
water, stirring constantly. Season with salt, pepper, and one-half
teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet.


FRANCONIA POTATOES

Wash and pare six medium-sized potatoes; parboil five minutes. Drain
dry. Place on grate around roast beef. Baste with fat in pan when
basting roast. Bake from thirty to thirty-five minutes, turning often or
when basting roast. Sprinkle with salt and serve surrounding rolled
roast, alternating with Stuffed Tomatoes.


BAKED TOMATOES

Select six smooth, firm, ripe tomatoes. Wash, wipe and cut a slice from
the stem end; scoop out the seeds and soft pulp. Mix with the pulp an
equal amount of corn cut from the cob, one tablespoon finely chopped
green pepper, half tablespoon finely chopped onion. Season with salt and
pepper, add one and one-half tablespoons melted butter and a teaspoon
salt. Mix well and refill tomato cups; sprinkle tops with buttered
crumbs. Place tomatoes in a granite dripping pan and bake until tomatoes
are soft and crumbs are brown. Remove to serving dish with a broad knife
and serve.


SPICED CRAB APPLES

Pick over, wash and drain firm crab apples, do not remove the stems.
(Apples must not be too ripe). For eight pounds of fruit allow four
pounds of sugar, one quart vinegar, one-fourth cup whole cloves,
one-fourth cup stick cinnamon broken in pieces. Boil sugar, vinegar and
spices ten minutes. Strain and tie spices loosely in a piece of cheese
cloth. Put fruit in strained liquor, also bag of spices, and cook slowly
until fruit can be easily pierced with a small wooden skewer
(tooth-pick). Remove fruit and fill a sterilized stone jar. Simmer
liquor slowly until reduced to half the original quantity; pour over
fruit. Lay bag of spices on top; seal and store.


ESCAROLLE SALAD

Marinate the bleached leaves of two heads of escarolle with French
Dressing. Chill one hour before serving that it may be crisp. Sprinkle
thickly with finely chopped chives and a sweet, red, bell pepper chopped
very fine or cut in fine thread-like rings.

PROCESS: Sift flour, spices, salt and soda; add raisins, molasses, milk
and eggs, beat thoroughly, then add melted Cottolene. Turn into

OYSTER SOUP

(For recipe see Page 162.)


ROAST TURKEY

Select a plump, ten-pound young turkey; dress, clean, stuff and truss in
shape; place it on thin slices of fat pork laid in the bottom of
dripping pan; rub the entire surface with salt, sprinkle with pepper and
dredge with flour. Place in a hot oven and brown delicately. Turn and
brown back of turkey; then turn breast side up; continue browning and
basting every ten minutes until bird is evenly and richly browned. Add
two cups water to fat in pan; continue basting every fifteen minutes
until bird is tender, which may be determined by piercing leg with small
wooden skewer. It will require from three to three and one-half hours,
depending upon the age of the bird. If the turkey is browning too
rapidly, cover with a piece of heavy paper well-buttered, placed over
turkey buttered side down. Remove the skewer and strings before placing
it on serving platter.

GIBLET SAUCE

Drain the liquid from the pan in which the turkey was roasted. Take six
tablespoons of the fat, strain the latter through a fine sieve. Return
the strained fat to the dripping pan and place on the range. Add seven
tablespoons of flour, stir to a smooth paste and brown richly, being
careful not to burn the mixture. Then pour on slowly while stirring
constantly, three cups of stock (in which the neck, pinions and giblets
were cooked). Bring it to the boiling point, and season to taste. Chop
the giblets very fine, first removing the tough parts of the gizzard;
then reheat them in sauce, and serve.

GRANDMA'S BREAD STUFFING

Remove the crust from two small baker's loaves; slice and pick in small
bits; season with one-half teaspoon pepper, two and one-half teaspoons
salt, one-half teaspoon powdered sage, and one medium-sized onion finely
chopped; mix well, using two forks; melt two-thirds cup of butter in
three-fourths cup boiling water; add to first mixture; toss lightly with
forks; add two eggs slightly beaten, mix well, and fill well the body
and breast of turkey. If bread is very stale, more moisture may be
added. If a crumbly stuffing is desired, omit eggs.


CRANBERRY JELLY

Pick over and wash one quart cranberries. Seed two-thirds cup raisins;
add to cranberries; add one cup boiling water and boil twenty minutes.
Rub through a sieve, and add to pulp two cups sugar and two-thirds cups
scalded seeded raisins; cook five minutes, stirring constantly. Turn
into a mold previously wet with cold water. Chill and serve.


SWEET CORN NEW ENGLAND STYLE

Chop one can of corn or two cups of green corn fine. Add three eggs
slightly beaten, one-half tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon salt,
one-eighth teaspoon pepper, one tablespoon melted butter and two cups
scalded milk. Turn into a buttered baking dish or into individual
ramekins, and bake in a slow oven until solid or custard-like. Serve in
baking dish.


CREAMED ONIONS

Remove the skins from one dozen medium-sized onions, under water--to
prevent the odor from penetrating the fingers--or grease the fingers
before beginning to peel them. Drain, place them in a sauce-pan, and
cover with cold water; bring quickly to the boiling-point and boil five
minutes. Drain and cover with boiling salted water; let cook uncovered
until tender (about one hour), but not broken. Prepare a thin cream
sauce made as follows:

CREAM SAUCE

Melt three tablespoons butter in a sauce-pan; add three tablespoons
flour; stir to a smooth paste. Add one and one-half cups hot thin cream
or milk; season with salt and pepper. Reheat onions in sauce; turn in
hot serving-dish, and sprinkle with one-half teaspoon finely chopped
parsley.


HOT SLAW

Shave one-half head white cabbage as fine as possible, using a sharp
knife. Serve with a dressing made of yolks of two eggs slightly beaten;
add one-fourth cup each of hot water and hot vinegar, slowly beating
constantly, four tablespoons butter, a few drops onion juice, one-half
teaspoon salt, and sift in one-half teaspoon ground mustard and
one-eighth teaspoon pepper. Stir this mixture over hot water until it
thickens to the consistency of cream; add to cabbage; mix well; place on
range, stirring constantly until mixture is heated throughout. Two
tablespoons of sugar may be added.

SCOTCH POTATO SOUP

(For recipe see Page 38.)


PORK TENDERLOIN LYONNAISE

Wipe and split two large pork tenderloins in halves lengthwise; sprinkle
with salt, pepper and dredge with flour. Melt two tablespoons each of
Cottolene and butter in an iron frying pan, and brown tenderloin richly
on both sides in the hot fat. Remove to well-greased dripping pan and
add to fat three onions thinly sliced; cook until delicately browned,
stirring often. Sprinkle over onions two tablespoons flour, stir well.
Put two tablespoons vinegar into one-half cup hot water, add slowly to
onions, mix thoroughly. Lay tenderloins over onions, cover closely and
cook in the oven until meat is tender. Dispose tenderloin on hot serving
platter and pour over contents of frying pan. Vinegar may be omitted and
more water added.


BAKED APPLES

Wipe and core eight tart apples; arrange them in a granite dripping pan.
Fill cavities with sugar and drop one-fourth teaspoon butter on top of
each, sprinkle with cinnamon, sprinkle round one-half cup sugar and pour
on one cup cold water. Bake in a slow oven until soft, basting often
with syrup in pan. Dispose on serving dish and sprinkle with granulated
sugar.


SCALLOPED POTATOES

Wash, pare and slice six medium-sized potatoes. Butter a quart baking
dish, lay in a layer of potatoes, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dot
over with bits of butter, dredge with flour and sprinkle lightly with
chives. Repeat until potatoes are used and two tablespoons each of
butter, flour and chives. Pour over one and one-half cups milk. Cover
and bake one hour in the oven. Remove cover and brown top. Serve in
baking dish.


BERMUDA SALAD

Slice thinly three or four Bermuda onions. Sprinkle with one tablespoon
sugar, one teaspoon salt and cover with ice water. Let stand three
hours. Drain and serve with French Dressing.


APRICOT DUMPLINGS

          2 cups flour.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1 tablespoon Cottolene.
          1 cup thick cream.
          Apricots.

PROCESS: Mix and sift flour, salt and baking powder, rub in Cottolene
with tips of fingers, add cream, cutting it into flour mixture with a
knife. Mix well. Turn on a floured board, knead slightly and roll out to
one-half inch thickness. Shape with a large biscuit-cutter and place two
halves of peeled apricots (drained from the syrup in the can) on each
circle. Enclose them, pressing edges of dough together. Place them in a
well-buttered granite dripping pan, one and one-half inches apart;
sprinkle round them one cup granulated sugar, pour around two and
one-half cups cold water. Bake in a hot oven twenty minutes, basting
three times during cooking. Serve with

          Sherry wine, brandy or vanilla.
          1 cup powdered sugar.
          Nutmeg.

          1/2 cup capers

PROCESS: Melt butter in a sauce-pan, add flour mixed with seasonings.
Stir to a paste and pour on slowly broth in which mutton was boiled,
first removing fat. Beat until smooth and glossy, add capers and heat to
boiling point. Serve in sauce-boat.


SAVORY RICE

Cook one cup well-washed rice in three quarts of boiling water until
partially softened. Drain; add to rice two cups of well-seasoned White
Stock; turn into double boiler and steam until rice is soft and stock
absorbed. Stir in one-fourth cup butter, one tablespoon finely chopped
chives or parsley. Mix well with a fork and turn into hot serving dish.
Sprinkle with pepper.


STEAMED SQUASH

Cut a marrow squash in slices, remove the seeds and stringy portions,
pare and lay in a steamer. Cook over boiling water until tender. Drain
perfectly dry. Mash and season with butter, salt, pepper and a little
sugar. Serve hot with tiny dots of butter over top.


STUFFED EGG PLANT

leaving a shell one-eighth inch thick. Cut pulp in one-half inch cubes,
and cook in boiling salted water until tender; drain. Cook two
tablespoons butter with one onion finely chopped, until delicately
colored (not brown), add one tablespoon finely chopped parsley. Mix with
egg plant, season with salt and pepper, and refill shell. Cover with
one-half cup buttered crumbs and bake in the oven until heated
throughout and crumbs are brown. Serve in shell.


LIMA BEAN SALAD

          2 cups or
          1 can lima beans.
          French dressing.
          Cream Dressing.
          2 hard-cooked eggs.
          1 tablespoon finely chopped chives.

PROCESS: Cook beans in boiling salted water until tender; drain. If
canned French lima beans are used, drain from liquor in can and rinse in
cold water. Cover beans with French Dressing, let stand one hour. Drain
and sprinkle with chives (onion juice may be used). Mix with Cream
Dressing and arrange in nests of lettuce heart leaves. Garnish with eggs
cut in quarters lengthwise; dip sharp edge in French Dressing, then in
finely chopped chives or parsley.


GRAHAM BREAD SANDWICHES

Rub one cream cheese to a paste, add six olives finely chopped and
one-half cup finely chopped pecans. Spread thin slices of graham bread
with chive butter. Spread an equal number slices of bread with cheese
mixture. Lay one of each together, press edges, trim off crusts and cut
diagonally across in triangles.

GRAHAM BREAD

          4 cups boiling water.
          2 tablespoons sugar.
          1 tablespoon salt.
          2 tablespoons Cottolene.

          1/2 cup lukewarm water.
          8 cups Graham flour.
          6 cups white flour.

PROCESS: Put sugar, salt and Cottolene in large mixing bowl. Pour on
boiling water; when lukewarm add dissolved yeast cake. Sift together
Graham and white flour, reserving one cup white flour for kneading. Add
flour gradually to water mixture, stirring constantly; beat as mixture
becomes stiff. Turn on a well-floured board and knead until dough is
smooth and elastic. Return dough to bowl, cover and set to rise in a
warm place. When dough has doubled its bulk, cut it down with a knife
without removing from bowl; cover and set to rise again. When double in
bulk, knead slightly, weigh dough and divide into one-pound loaves.
Shape loaves, place two loaves in each well-greased, brick-shaped bread
pan, brush between loaves with melted Cottolene. (There will be six
loaves.) Cover and set to rise; when light, bake one hour in a "bread
oven."

          1 tablespoon vinegar.
          2 tablespoons lemon juice.
          1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce.
          3 tablespoons tomato catsup.
          1 teaspoon salt.
          Few drops Tobasco Sauce.

PROCESS: Mix ingredients in the order given. Chill thoroughly and pour
over oyster cocktails. Place six small oysters in each cocktail glass,
add sauce and serve very cold. This sauce is sufficient for six
cocktails. Oyster Cocktails may be served very attractively in tomato
cups.


CREAM OF ALMOND SOUP

          2 quarts chicken or white stock.
          1-1/2 tablespoons butter.
          3/4 cup blanched almonds.
          2 tablespoons cornstarch.
          1 cup hot cream.
          Salt, pepper.
          Few grains nutmeg.

PROCESS: Cook the butter and flour together in a sauce-pan; add
gradually hot stock until of the consistency to pour; then add
remaining stock, let cook gently twenty minutes. Chop almonds fine,
then pound them to a paste, add to first mixture and beat until
thoroughly blended. Add hot cream and seasoning. Serve en tasse;
sprinkle each portion with finely chopped parsley.


ROAST BRACE OF DUCKS

Dress and clean a brace (two) young domestic or wild ducks. Truss same
as goose. If domestic ducks are used they may be stuffed. In the wild
ducks place in each a head of celery; this is thought to improve their
flavor. Domestic ducks should always be cooked "well done" and twice as
long as wild ducks. Place the ducks on rack in dripping pan, sprinkle
with salt and pepper, cover breast and legs with very thin slices of fat
salt pork. Place in a hot oven and roast one and one-quarter hours,
basting every five minutes (with fat in pan) for the first half hour,
afterwards every ten minutes. Domestic ducks require a hotter oven than
wild ducks or fowl. When tender, remove string and skewers. Place on hot
serving platter, surround with Thorn Apples and serve with Olive sauce.

STUFFING

          2 cups cracker crumbs.
          1 cup English walnut meats broken in small bits.
          1 cup thick cream.
          1/2 cup butter.
          1 onion finely chopped.
          1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.
          1/2 teaspoon celery salt.
          1/4 teaspoon salt.
          1/8 teaspoon black pepper.

PROCESS: Crush crackers with the hands, not too fine. Add nut meats,
butter melted, cream, onion and parsley; mix well with a fork; add
seasonings. If stuffing appears too dry add more cream (a cup of chopped
apple or celery may be added). This is sufficient stuffing for one duck.

OLIVE SAUCE

          4 tablespoons butter.
          1 slice onion.
          5-1/2 tablespoons flour.
          2 cups Brown Stock.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1/4 teaspoon pepper.
          1 dozen olives.

PROCESS: Melt butter in sauce-pan, add onion and cook until delicately
browned; remove onion and stir butter until well browned; add flour
sifted with seasonings, stir to a smooth paste and continue browning.
Add stock gradually, beating constantly. Pare the meat from olive pits,
leaving it in one continuous curl. Cover with boiling water and cook six
or seven minutes. Drain and add to Sauce.


GLAZED SWEET POTATOES

Wash and pare six medium-sized sweet potatoes. Parboil ten minutes in
boiling salted water; drain and cut lengthwise in halves. Arrange them
in a well-buttered granite dripping pan. Make a syrup by boiling one cup
sugar with one-half cup water and two tablespoons butter three or four
minutes. Dip each piece of potato into syrup and arrange in dripping
pan. Bake until potatoes are tender (about forty minutes) basting two or
three times with remaining syrup. Oven should not be too hot as these
potatoes will scorch easily.


"THORN" APPLES

Prepare a syrup by boiling two cups sugar and one and three-fourths cups
water ten minutes. Wash, wipe, core and pare the desired number of
apples (about eight for this quantity of syrup). Drop apples into syrup
when pared, to prevent discoloration. Cook until tender, skimming syrup
when necessary. Use a deep sauce-pan for this purpose, as apples cook
better when covered with syrup. Better cook four apples at a time. Drain
from syrup and fill the cavities with quince jelly and stick apples
thickly with blanched and shredded almonds slightly toasted. Cut the
almonds lengthwise in three pieces, then divide, making six "thorns." It
is best to toast them in the oven until they are a golden brown.


HAWAIIAN SALAD

Arrange slices of canned Hawaiian pineapple, drained from the liquor in
the can, in nests of crisp lettuce heart leaves. Pile on these Malaga
grapes peeled, cut in halves lengthwise and seeds removed, mixed with an
equal quantity of English walnut meats broken in pieces. Sprinkle
thickly with candied cherries, cut in fine shreds or chopped. Moisten
with French Dressing No. 2.

FRENCH DRESSING NO. 2

          1/4 teaspoon salt.
          1/4 teaspoon paprika.
          Few grains cayenne.
          6 tablespoons olive oil.
          2 tablespoons lemon juice or
          1 tablespoon Tarragon vinegar and
          1 of lemon juice.

PROCESS: Put dry ingredients in bowl, add oil, mix well, then add lemon
juice slowly while stirring constantly. Chill thoroughly and use on
Fruit Salad.


PLUM PUDDING

          1/2 lb. stale bread crumbs.
          1 cup scalded milk.
          1/3 cup soft brown sugar.

          1/4 cup brandy.
          1/2 grated nutmeg.
          1 teaspoon cinnamon.
          1/2 teaspoon mace.
          1/2 teaspoon cloves.
          1-1/2 teaspoons salt.

PROCESS: Add crumbs to milk and let soak one or more hours. Add sugar,
yolks of eggs beaten very light, fruits mixed with nut meats and citron.
Cream Cottolene and add to first mixture, then brandy and spices sifted
together. Fold in whites of eggs beaten stiff; mix thoroughly and turn
into a well-greased tube mold and steam five to six hours. Remove from

add sugar gradually, beating constantly; add Cottolene and continue
beating. Mix and sift flour, nutmeg, salt, and soda, add alternately to
first mixture with sour cream. Chill dough, then toss on a slightly
floured board, roll to one-half inch thickness; shape with cutter and
fry in deep, hot Cottolene. Drain on soft brown paper. When cool,
sprinkle with powdered sugar.


CRULLERS

          4 tablespoons Cottolene.
          1-1/4 cup sugar.
          2 eggs.
          4 cups flour.
          1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.
          4 teaspoons baking powder.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          3/4 cup milk.
          1/4 cup Sherry wine.
          Cinnamon and powdered sugar.

PROCESS: Cream the Cottolene, add sugar gradually, beating constantly.
Add yolks beaten thick and light, and whites beaten stiff and dry. Mix
and sift flour, salt, nutmeg and baking powder, add to first mixture
alternately with milk; add Sherry wine. Turn onto a well-floured board
and pat and roll to one-eighth inch thickness. Cut in pieces three
inches long by two and one-half inches wide, make four parallel gashes
lengthwise of each cruller, at equal distances apart; lift each by
running fingers through gashes and drop carefully into hot Cottolene;
turn when they rise to top of fat. When cooked, drain on brown paper and
sprinkle with powdered sugar mixed with a little cinnamon.


FRIED OYSTERS (IN CRACKER MEAL)

Wash the desired number of New York Counts, using one cup cold water to
a quart of oysters. Drain and dry them between crash towels. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper, dredge with flour and dip them, one at a time, in
egg, diluted with two tablespoons cold water to each egg. Then dip in
fine cracker meal. It is very important that each oyster is well covered
with crumbs. Fry in deep hot Cottolene to a golden brown. Drain on brown
paper, garnish with stuffed olives and sprays of parsley.


FRIED OYSTERS (IN BATTER)

Follow directions in the foregoing recipe, and dip oysters in batter
(see next page). Fry in deep hot Cottolene, turn occasionally. Drain and
serve on folded napkin, garnished with curled celery and slices of lemon
rind dipped in finely chopped parsley.

BATTER

          1 cup bread flour.
          1/2 teaspoon salt.
          1/2 teaspoon celery salt.
          1/8 teaspoon pepper.
          2 eggs.
          3/4 cup milk.

PROCESS: Mix and sift dry ingredients; add milk slowly, beating
constantly until batter is smooth. Beat eggs thick and light, cut and
fold them into batter. Beat thoroughly and dip the drained and dried
oysters into batter, one by one, and fry in deep, hot Cottolene.


COD FISH BALLS

          1 cup "picked up" codfish.
          2-2/3 cups potatoes.
          1 egg well beaten.
          1 tablespoon butter.
          Few grains pepper.

PROCESS: Wash fish and cover with cold water; let stand several hours,
"pick up" in small pieces. Wash, pare and cut potatoes in small cubes,
measure them, soak in cold water for an hour; cook with fish in boiling
water until potatoes are soft. Drain through a sieve until quite dry;
return to sauce-pan in which they were cooked, mash thoroughly that
there may be no lumps left in potatoes. Add butter, egg and pepper. Beat
with a slotted wooden spoon until very light. Season with salt if
necessary. Take up by rounded tablespoons, place in croquette basket and
fry one minute in deep hot Cottolene (frying six fish balls at a time);
drain on brown paper. Allow fat to reheat between fryings.


MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL BUTTER

PROCESS: Cream four tablespoons butter with a wooden spoon; add one-half
teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon pepper and a few grains cayenne, in
the order given; also one-half tablespoon finely chopped parsley, and
three-fourths tablespoon lemon juice, drop by drop, beating constantly.
This is used as a dressing for certain kinds of fish.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
