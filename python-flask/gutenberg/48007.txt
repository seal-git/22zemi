                             CHARACTERS.

         SANTUZZA, a village girl            _Soprano_.
         LOLA, wife of Alfio           _Mezzo Soprano_.
         TURIDDU, a young soldier              _Tenor_.
         ALFIO, a teamster                  _Baritone_.
         LUCIA, mother of Turiddu          _Contralto_.

  CHORUS OF PEASANTS AND VILLAGERS.--CHORUS BEHIND THE SCENES.


PLOT OF THE OPERA.

TURIDDU, a young villager, is the son of LUCIA, and the lover of LOLA,
(who is the wife of ALFIO; having married the latter during TURIDDU'S
prolonged absence in military service). TURIDDU wins the affections
of SANTUZZA, whom he wrongs; while, in the meantime, he is intimate
with LOLA. On Easter morning, (the opening of the opera), ALFIO is
incidentally informed, by SANTUZZA, of his wife's unfaithful actions. He
challenges TURIDDU (biting the ear, as was the rustic Sicilian custom).
TURIDDU, though regretting his past evil course, accepts the challenge
and is killed by ALFIO

  TURIDDU. (Behind the scenes.)
    O Lo-la, fair as flow'rs in beau-ty smil-ing, ...
    Love from thy soul-lit eyes
    Soft-ly is glow-ing; ...
    He who would kiss thy lips, red and be-guil-ing ...
    Bliss-ful and fa-vor'd were he,
    Such heav-en know-ing!...
    Tho' thy thresh-old blood, crim-son, is stain-ing, ...
    Car-ing for naught, I seek thee, scorning to hide me; ...
    What tho' I for-feit life, thy pres-ence gain-ing?
    What were the joy of heav'n, wert thou de-nied me!
    What tho' I for-feit life, thy pres-ence gain-ing,
    What were the joy of heav'n wert thou de-nied me.
    Ah! ... Ah! ... Ah! ... Ah! ...

    O Lo-la, bian-ca co-me fior di spi-no, ...
        quan-do t'af-fac-ci te s'affac-(cia il) so-le; ...
    Chi t'ha ba-cia-(to il) lab-bro por-po-ri-no ...
    Gra-zia più bel-la a Di-o chie-der non vô-le....

    Ma di re-star-(ci a) me non me n'in-por-ta; ...
    Se per te mo-(jo e) va-(do in) pa-ra-di-so,

SCENE I.

A public place or square in a Sicilian village. At right, in background,
a church. At left, the inn and dwelling of Mamma Lucia.

Time, Easter morning.

(Peasants, countrymen, country-women, and children, cross the stage.)

(The church doors open and the throng enters.)

(The movement continues until the following:)

INTRODUCTORY CHORUS.

 _Chorus of women._

              (Behind scenes.)

         Ah! Ah!

 _Chorus of men._

              (Behind scenes.)

         Ah! Ah!

 _Chorus of women._

              (Behind scenes.)

 Sweet is the air with the blossoms of oranges;
   Sings now the lark from the myrtles in flow'r;
 Murmurs of tender song tell of a joyful world,
   And of thankful hearts. Ah! gladsome hour!

              (The women enter.)

 _Chorus of men._

              (Behind scenes.)

 Your spinning wheels now busily are humming,
 O'er fields of golden corn the sound is coming;
 We linger where the leafy shade is restful;
 Of you we think, and every heart is zestful.
 Oh lovely women! Allured by you and enraptured,
 Like the bird by the lure held, now are we captured!

              (The men enter.)

_Women._
       Work in the field now is ended;--
       The Holy Mother mild
       In ecstasy fondles the Child.

 _All._

              (Withdrawing from stage.)

 Murmurs of tender song tell of a joyful world,
 And of thankful hearts.
 Ah! gladsome hour!

          (Enter, Santuzza, approaching Lucia's dwelling.)


SCENA I.

La scena rappresenta una piazza in un paese della Sicilia. Nel fondo, a
destra, Chiesa con porta practicabile. A sinistra l'osteria e la casa di
Mamma Lucia.

E il giorno Pasqua.

CORO D'INTRODUZIONE.

(Campane interne dalla Chiesa. Si alza la tela. La scena sul principio è
vuota. Albeggia. Paesani, contadini, contadine e ragazzi traversano la
scena. Si apre la chiesa e la folla vi entra. Il movimento del popolo
continua fino al Coro punto in cui rimane la scena vuota.)

 _Coro._

              (Donne di dentro.)

         Ah!

              (Uomini di dentro.)

         Ah!

              (Donne di dentro.)

 Gli aranci olezzano sui verdi margini,
 Cantan le allodole tra i mirti in fior;
 Tempo è si mormori da ognuno il tenero canto che i palpiti--
 Raddoppia al cor.

           (Le donne entrano in iscena.)

              (Uomini di dentro.)

 _Coro_.
      In mezzo al campo tra le spiche d'oro
      Giunge il rumore delle vostre spole,
      Noi stanchi riposando dal lavoro
      A voi pensiamo, o belle occhidisole.
      O belle occhidisole, a voi corriamo,
       Come vola l'augelo--al suo richiamo.

             (Gli uomini entrano in iscena.)

 _Donne._ Cessin le rustiche opre:
             La Virgine serena allietasi del Salvator;
             Tempo è si mormori da ognuno il
                     tenero canto che i palpiti--
             Raddoppia al cor.

 _Uomini._

              (Allontanandosi.)

         In mezzo al campo, etc.

 _Donne._

              (Allontanandosi.)

         Gli aranci olezzano, etc.


SCENE II.

              (Santuzza, Lucia, Alfio, and chorus.)

 _Santuzza._ Tell me, mother Lucia--

 _Lucia._

                   (Coming from house.)

     It is thou? What wilt thou?

 _Sant._ Where is Turiddu?

 _Lucia._ For him you ask? For him, my son Turiddu!

 _Sant._ Only for him I ask you. Pardon, but answer!
              Where is Turiddu?

 _Lucia._ Ask me not! I know not; I want no trouble.

 _Sant._ Mamma Lucia, with weeping do I pray you!
            Even as spake the Saviour to the Magdalen,
            Say, in pity say, where is Turiddu!

 _Lucia._ He's gone to bring some wine from Francofonte.

 _Sant._ No! Last night some within the village saw him.

 _Lucia._ What says't thou? Who told it?
             Nay, he hath not yet returned.
             Enter!

 _Sant._  I may not step across your threshold,
             I cannot pass it, I, most unhappy outcast!
             Excommunicated!

 _Lucia._ What of my son? What hast thou to tell me?

 _Sant._ Ah! the torture, the heart-pain.

  (Cracking of whips and jingling of bells behind scenes.)

            (Chorus enters, followed soon by Alfio.)


SCENA II.

Sortita di Alfio.

 _Santuzza._

          (Entra e si dirige alla casa di Lucia.)

               Dite, Mamma Lucia--

 _Lucia._

                    (Sortendo.)

            Sei tu? che vuoi?

 _Santuzza._ Turiddu ov'è?

 _Lucia._ Fin qui vieni a cercare il figlio mio?

 _Santuzza._ Voglio saper soltanto,
                 Perdonatemi voi, dove trovarlo.

 _Lucia._ Non lo so, non lo so, non voglio brighe!

 _Santuzza._ Mamma Lucia, vi supplico piangendo,
                  Fate come il Signore a Maddalena,
                  Ditemi per pietà, dov'è Turiddu.

 _Lucia._ E andato per il vino a Francofonte.

 _Santuzza._ No! l'han visto in paese ad alta notte.

 _Lucia._ Che dici? che dici? se non è tornato a casa!
               Entra!

 _Santuzza._ Non posso entrare in casa vostra.
                  Sono scomunicata!

 _Lucia._ E che ne sai del mio figliuolo?

 _Santuzza._ Quale spina ho in core!

(Dall'interno schiocchi di frusta e tintinnio di sonagli.
Entrano in iscena i coristi indi Alfio.)

SCENE AND PRAYER.

 _Lucia._ Blest are you, friendly Alfio!
               So favored, ever thus to be gay!

 _Alfio._ Mamma Lucia, have you that rare old wine,
               The same as ever?

 _Lucia._ Not now; Turiddu has gone to buy a plenty.

 _Alfio._ No; he is here! I saw him here this morning;
                He lingered near my cottage.

 _Lucia._

               (Surprised.)

              What now!

 _Santuzza._

           (Rapidly, to Lucia.)

       Mamma Lucia,
 N'avete ancora di quel vecchio vino?


 _Lucia._ Non so; Turiddu è andato a prov vederne.

 _Alfio._ Se è sempre qui!
               L'ho visto stamattina vicino a casa mia.

 _Lucia._

                    (Sorpresa.)

           Come?

SCENE IV.

ROMANZA.

 _Lucia._

                (To Santuzza.)

          And why with signals would you gain my silence?

 _Santuzza._ Now shall you know, kind mother:
                 Ere he went forth as a soldier,
                 Turiddu pledged his love to Lola,
                     All his faithfulness renewing
                 But; ah! homeward returning,
                 Married he found his Lola!
                 And, her falsity shaming--
                     All the old love subduing--
                       Loved _me_!
                 And I  loved _him_!
                 With jealousy, hatefully, and with madness,
                 Scorning wifely duty, envious of my gladness,
                 Lola, in malice shameful, regains Turiddu!
                 Fate disgraceful o'ertakes me,
                 My own Turiddu forsakes me!
                 Lola and he in joy remain,
                 Having each other's love again!
                 Ah me! alone I weep, I weep!

 _Lucia._ Grief is upon us!
              Such dire and woeful tidings to hear this holy morning.

 _Santuzza._ I am accursed! I am accursed!
                 Good mother, go pray for me unto the Saviour!
                 Thou'lt beseech Him for me!
                 I'll seek Turiddu, and pray to him
                 That he again may love me!

 _Lucia._ Holy Mary be with thee--the blessed Mary!

      (Lucia enters the church)


SCENA IV.

 _Lucia._ Perchè m'hai fatto segno di tacere?

 _Santuzza._ Voi lo sapete, o mamma, prima d'andar soldato
                 Turiddu aveva a Lola eterna fè giurato.
                 Tornò, la seppe sposa; e con un nuovo amore
                 Volle spegner la fiamma che gli bruciava il core
                 M'amò, l'amai, l'amai, ah!
                 Quell' invida d'ogni delizia mia,
                 Del suo sposo dimentica, arse di gelosia.
                 Me l'ha rapito. Priva dell' onor mio,
                 Dell' onor mio rimango:
                 Lola e Turiddu s'amano, io piango!

 _Lucia._ Miseri noi, che cosa vieni a dirmi
              In questo santo giorno?

 _Santuzza._ Io son dannata.
                 Andate, o mamma, ad implorare Iddio,
                 E pregate per me. Verrà Turiddu,
                 Vo' supplicarlo un' altra voltra ancora!

 _Lucia._ Ajutatela voi, Santa Maria!

       (Lucia entra in chiesa.)


SCENE V.

DUET. SANTUZZA AND TURIDDU.

 _Turiddu._

        (Entering.)

 Thou here, Santuzza!

 _Santuzza._ Here I await thee.

 _Turiddu._ Attending not the service of Easter?

 _Santuzza._ Not now! Thee would I speak with.

 _Turiddu._ I seek my mother.

 _Santuzza._ Thee would I speak with!

 _Turiddu._ Not here, not here!

 _Santuzza._ From whence dost thou come?

 _Turiddu._ Why dost thou ask me?--
                     From Francofonte.

 _Santuzza._ Ah, that is false!

 _Turiddu._ Santuzza, believe me!

 _Santuzza._ No! thou art lying!
                 Over yon path I beheld thee approach:
                 And thou wert seen to-day returning homeward
                 From the dwelling of Lola!

 _Turiddu._  Ah! thou wert spying!

 _Santuzza._ No, I do swear it!
                 Her husband, Alfio, saw thee
                 Here within the town, and told it me!

 _Turiddu._ So thou rewardest the love I gave thee,
                What though he slay me!

 _Santuzza._ Ah! Tell me not of murder!

 _Turiddu._ Leave me, I tell thee! leave me!
                The rage within me burning--
                My righteous wrath, thou canst not assuage!

 _Santuzza._ Then, thou oost love her!
                 More fair than I is Lola!
                 False friend! Oh, curses on her!

 _Turiddu._ Santuzza!

 _Santuzza._ She--vilest woman, steals the love that should be mine!

 _Turiddu._ Heed thou!
                I am no slave to thy envy
                Scornfully showing, jealously showing.

 _Santuzza._ Insult and punishment I am unheeding!
                 Yet do I love thee,
                 Even though anguish my heart is rending,
                 E'en though in sorrow my life is ending.


SCENA V.

 _Turiddu._

          (Entrando.)

   Tu qui Santuzza?

 _Santuzza._ Qui t'aspettavo.

 _Turiddu._ È Pasqua in chiesa non vai?

 _Santuzza._ Non vo. Debbo parlarti.

 _Turiddu._ Mamma cercavo.

 _Santuzza._ Debbo parlarti.

 _Turiddu._ Qui no! qui no!

 _Santuzza._

          (Parlato.)

      Dove sei stato?

 _Turiddu._

          (Parlato.)

 Che vuoi tu dire? A Francofonte.

 _Santuzza._ No, non è ver.

 _Turiddu._ Santuzza credimi.

 _Santuzza._ No, non mentire
                 Ti vidi volgere giù dal sentir.
                 E stamattina all' alba t'hanno
                 Scorto presso l'uscio di Lola.

 _Turiddu._ Ah! mi hai spiato!

 _Santuzza._ No! te lo giuro, a noi l'ha raccontato
                 Campar Alfio il marito poco fa.

 _Turiddu._ Così ricambi l'amor che ti porto?
                Vuoi che m'uccida?

 _Santuzza._ Oh! questo non lo dire.

 _Turiddu._ Lasciami dunque, lasciami invantenti sopire
                Il giusto sdegno colla tua pietà.
 _Santuzza._ Tu l'ami dunque?

 _Turiddu._  No!

 _Santuzza._ Assai più bella è Lola!

 _Turiddu._  Taci, non l'amo.

 _Santuzza._ L'ami, l'ami, Oh! maledetto!

 _Turiddu._  Santuzza!

 _Santuzza._ Quella cattiva femmina ti tolse a me!

 _Turiddu._  Bada, Santuzza, schiavo non sono
                 Di questa vana tua gelosia.

 _Santuzza._

              (Con angoscia.)

          Battimi, insultami, t'amo e perdono
          Ma è troppo forte l'angoscia mia.

         (Troncando nel sentire avvicinarsi Lola.)


SCENE VI.

LOLA'S DITTY.

 _Lola._

         (Behind scenes.)

       Bright flower, so radiant!
       Angelic thousands stand arrayed in heaven,
       Yet none so fair as thou hath yet been given!

         (Enters. Pauses suddenly.)

       Oh! Turiddu, hast thou seen Alfio?

 _Turiddu._ I came but this moment: I have not.

 _Lola._ Then at the forge perchance he awaiteth.
             Here I must not linger.
                      And thou?
             Is't here in public thou art praying?

 _Turiddu._

          (Confusedly.)

             Santuzza here was telling--

 _Santuzza._
             I was saying this is Easter!

                       (Meaningly.)

             And the Lord all things beholdeth!

 _Lola._

          (To Santuzza.)

             Thou wilt not go to the service?

 _Santuzza._
            No, no! None shall attend but those
            Who know they are not guilty!

 _Lola._

                (Vehemently.)

        In the grace of the Saviour
        I bow before thee!

 _Santuzza._

                (Bitterly.)

         O, well thou speakest!--
         Lola!

 _Turiddu._

                (Embarrassed.)
                  (To Lola.)

          Away then! Come, Lola;
          Here there is naught to hold us.

 _Lola._

                 (Ironically.)

         Oh, stay thou with _her_!

 _Santuzza._

                (To Turiddu.)

         Yes, stay thou!

                   (Firmly.)

         I have something yet to tell thee:

 _Lola._

                (Mockingly.)

         May the Saviour assist thee!

                  (Going.)

         So, I will leave thee.

               (Enters the church.)


SCENA VI.

 _Lola._

           (Dentra alla scena.)

          Fior di giaggiolo
            Gli angeli belli stano
          A mille in cielo
            Ma belli come lui
              Ce n'è uno solo.

       (Entra in iscena e s'interrompe.)

     Oh! Turiddu, e passato Alfio?

 _Turiddu._ Son giunto ora in piazza non so.

 _Lola._ Forse è rimasto dal maniscalco ma non può tardare!
             E voi sentite le funzioni in piazza?

 _Turiddu._

              (Confuso affret.)

           Santuzza mi narrava--

 _Santuzza._ Gli dicevo che oggi è Pasqua
                 E il Signor vede ogni cosa.

 _Lola._ Non venite alla messa?

 _Santuzza._

                 (Subito.)

          Io no, ci deve andar chi sa

              (Con intenzione.)

          Di non aver peccato!

 _Lola._

                 (Con forza.)

       Io ringrazio il Signore, e bacio in terra!

 _Santuzza._

                 (Esprimendosi.)

          Oh! fate bene, fate bene,

                 (Con amarezza.)

              Lola!

 _Turiddu._

                 (A Lola.)
               (Impacciato.)

          Andiamo, andiamo, Oni non abbiani che fare.

 _Lola._

                 (A Turiddu.)

             Oh!

                 (Con ironia.)

             Rimanete.

 _Santuzza._

                  (A Turiddu con fermezza.)

           Sì, resta, resta,
             Ho da parlarti ancora.

 _Lola._

                 (Sempre ironica.)

          E v'assista il Signore,

                 (Con caricatura.)

          Io me ne vado.

                (Entra in chiesa.)


SCENE VII.

CONTINUATION OF THE DUET.

 _Turiddu._

                (To Sant.)

         Ah! how foolish! naught availing!

 _Santuzza._

                (Coldly.)

      I have spoken; 'tis well--'tis the truth.

 _Turiddu._

                (Threateningly.)

         Ah! by heaven!

 _Santuzza._ My heart is breaking!

 _Turiddu._

                (Approaching her.)

            No!

 _Santuzza._

                (Warding him away.)

          Turiddu, ah! hear me!

 _Turiddu._

            Go!

                (Turns from her.)

 _Santuzza._

          (Threateningly.)

      False! False!

 _Turiddu._

        (With increased rage.)

      Thus I reward thee in my anger.

   (Throws her down, and hastens into the church.)

 _Santuzza._

          (In the height of fury.)

       Accurs'd! accurs'd at Easter, thou false one.

          (Falls, despairingly.)


SCENA VII.

 _Turiddu._

                (Con ironia.)

         Ah! lo vedi, che hai tu detto?

 _Santuzza._

                  (Fredda.)

         L'hai voluto e ben ti sta!


 _Turiddu._

                (S'avventa.)

            Ah! Per Dio!

 _Santuzza._ Squarciami il petto.

 _Turiddu._

                (S'avvia.)

            No!

 _Santuzza._

                (Trattenendolo.)

            Turiddu, ascolta!

 _Turiddu._ Va!

 _Santuzza._

            (Minacciosa.)

          Bada!

 _Turiddu._

        (Con moltissima forza.)

      Dell'ira tua non mi curo!

  (La getta a terra e fugge in chiesa.)

 _Santuzza._

          (Nel colmo dell'ira.)

      A te la mala Pasqua, spergiuro!

      (Cade affranta ed angosciata.)


  SANTUZZA.
    No, no. Tu-rid-du, re-main with me yet, and for-ev-er!
    Love me a-gain!
    How canst thou for-sake me!
    No, no, Tu-rid-du! In-to thine arms ... lov-ing a-gain,
    Say thou wilt take ... me!
    No, no, Tu-rid-du! Re-main with me yet and for ev-er!
    No Tu-rid-du, Tu-rid-du re-main with me ev-er!




  TURIDDU.
    Why dost thou fol-low me?
    Why dost thou watch me?
    Why dost thou spy e-ven at the church-door?
    Why dost thou fol-low, Why watch me ev-er?

  SANTUZZA.
    Lo! here thy San-tuz-za now doth im-plore ... thee; ...
    Ah! canst thou leave me weep-ing be-fore thee!
    Love thy San-tuz-za! No, Tu-rid-du! Stay, I im-plore thee!
    Oh! Tu-rid-du! No, Tu-rid-du, re-main, re-main!
    No! Tu-rid-du! Ah! ... No, Tu-rid-du,

    Now doth im-plore thee, Ah! canst thou leave me,
        thus weep-ing be-fore thee!
    Lo! thy San-tuz-za now doth im-plore thee!
    Ah! canst thou leave me? Ah! canst thou leave me?

    Ah! No! Tu-rid-du! Re-main with me yet and for-ev-er!
    I im-plore thee, do not for-sake me, Tu-rid-du!

  TURIDDU.

    Go! ... Go! Vain were re-pent-ance for thine of-fend-ing!
    Once more do I tell thee, go! And, for-ev-er!

SCENE VIII.

DUET, SANTUZZA AND ALFIO.

           (Enter, Alfio.)

 _Santuzza._

         (Calming herself.)

      Oh! doth the Saviour send thee, neighbor Alfio?

 _Alfio._  At what point is the service?

 _Santuzza._ 'T is now at closing.
                 But I tell thee Lola has gone with Turiddu!

_Alfio._

         (Surprised.)

       What are you saying?

 _Santuzza._ While thou dost labor to earn an honest living,
                  Lola unfaithfully her love is giving.

 _Alfio._ Ah! in the name of heaven, Santuzza, what sayest thou?

 _Santuzza._ The truth!
                  Turiddu forsakes me--and he hath betrayed me!
                  'T was your wife who enticed him away from me!

 _Alfio._

          (Threateningly.)

       And if thou art lying
       I'll have thy heart's blood!

 _Santuzza._ Lies, as yet, my lips have never uttered.
                  Prone to be truthful am I.

 _Alfio._

          (After a pause.)

        Santuzza, I am thankful that you have spoken.

 _Santuzza._ But ah! what shame!
                  And I have told it thee!

_Alfio._

           (Suddenly, in fury.)

       T'is they who are shameful!
       Revenge I'll have upon them!
       This day and hour my wrath
       Shall fall upon them!


SCENA VIII.

        (Sorte Alfio e s'incontra con Santuzza.)

 _Santuzza._

          (Ad Alfio rianimandosi.)
          Oh! Il Signore vi manda, compar Alfio.

 _Alfio._

          (Tranquillo.)

      A che punto è la messa?

 _Santuzza._

                È tardi ormai, ma per voi
                     (Con intenzione.)
                Lola è andata con Turiddu!

 _Alfio._

                (Sorpreso.)

      Che avete detto?

 _Santuzza._ Che mentre correte
                 All'acqua e al vento a guadagnarvi il pane,
                 Lola v'adorna il tetto in malo modo!

 _Alfio._  Ah! nel nome di Dio, Santa che dite?

 _Santuzza._ Il ver. Turiddu mi tolse, mi tolse l'onore,
                E vostra moglie lui rapiva a me!

 _Alfio._

                (Minaccioso.)

      Se voi mentite, vo' schiantarvi il core.

 _Santuzza._ Uso a mentire il labbro mio, il labbro mio non è!
                 Per la vergogna mia, pel mio dolore
                 La trista verità--vi dissi, ahimè!

 _Alfio._

               (Dopo un poco di pausa.)

      Comare Santa, allor grato vi sono.

 _Santuzza._ Infame io son che vi partai così!

 _Alfio._ Infami loro, ad essi non perdono
               Vendetta avrò pria che tramonti il dì!
               Io sangue voglio, all'ira m'abbandono,
               In odio tutto l'amor mio finì!

                       (Escono.)

 _Turiddu._ My pretty Lola! Have you not a greeting,
                 When honest people we are meeting?

 _Lola._ I must leave thee.
              I must go and welcome Alfio!

 _Turiddu._ Here he will seek thee.
                 Do not hasten!
                      (To the people.)
           Meanwhile, good friends, come hither.
                      (All come forward.)

  TURIDDU.

    Like a smile from hap-py love

           [Lola e Turiddu escono dalla chiesa.]

 _Turiddu._ Comare Lola, ve ne andante via
                 Senza nemmeno salutare?

 _Lola._ Vado a casa; Non ho visto compar Alfio!

 _Turiddu._ Non ci pensate, verrà in piazza.

           (Rivolgendosi al Coro che s'avvia.)

                 Intanto, amici, qua,
                 Beviamone un bicchiere.

FINALE.

 _Alfio._ Unto all of you, greeting!

 _Chorus._ Neighbor Alfio, greeting!

 _Turiddu._

                   (To Alfio.)

           Hearty welcome!
           Now join with us in revel.

                 (Fills a glass for him.)

           Look you! drink you this measure!

 _Alfio._ Thank you! but I must refuse the offer!
               A cup of deadly poison perhaps you proffer!

 _Turiddu._ Then suit your pleasure!

                  (Throws away the wine.)

 _Lola._ Ah me! what now befalls!

(Some of the women consult together, and then approach Lola, saying:)

              Neighbor Lola, come, haste away from here!

          (Exit, all the women, with LOLA.)

 _Turiddu._

                    (To Alfio.)

           Perhaps you have something to tell me!

 _Alfio._ I? nothing!

 _Turiddu._ Then hear me!
                 You will find me at your service!

 _Alfio._ This moment?

 _Turiddu._ This moment!

     (They embrace, Turiddu bites Alfio's ear, viciously.)

 _Alfio._ Neighbor Turiddu, you give a ready challenge!
               And I accept it! you understand me!

 _Turiddu._ Neighbor Alfio!
                I own thou shouldst have vengeance,
                And I admit, in the name that is holy,
                That I should be dealt with as a dog, by thee!
                But, shouldst thou kill me--if I perish
                By thine arm--yes, if I perish,--
                Unhappy Santa, she whom I have cherished--
                Lone, unhappy Santa, my dagger
                Will embed within thy heart!

 _Alfio._ Good neighbor, act upon it as may suit you!
                  You will find me yonder in the orchard.

                         (Exit.)

 _Turiddu._

                        (Calling.)

             My mother!

                     (Enter LUCIA.)

             Mother! the wine-cup too freely passes!
             Exciting, crazing!
             Too many cups I have been drinking!
             ----I must leave you, good mother!

             But first let me ask for a kindly blessing,
             As on that day when I became a soldier.
             And, mother, hear me--and heed it:
             If I return not, thou unto my Santa
             Must be a kindly mother!
             Santa, whom I promised I would lead to the altar!
             --If I return--

 _Lucia._ Why say you this to me?
               What is it? tell me!

 _Turiddu._ Ha--nothing!
                'Tis wine--that I have drunk so freely.
            --For me oh! pray to heaven,
              That I may be forgiven!
            One kiss, one kiss, my mother!
            And yet--and yet another!
              Farewell!

                    (Rushes off, desperately.)

 _Lucia._ Turiddu! Ah!

               (Retires to back of stage, crying.)
                     (Enter, Santuzza.)

            Santuzza!

 _Santuzza._ Ah! good mother!

        (Throws her arms around Lucia's neck.)

            (People crowd upon the stage.)

              (Excitement and agitation.)

(Enter a woman in the distance crying, "Neighbor Turiddu is murdered.")

  (Several women hastily enter, terrified. One of them shrieks--)

           "Neighbor Turiddu is murdered."

               (All rush upon the stage.)

 _All._ Ah!

(Santuzza falls; swooning. Lucia faints,
and is supported by some of the women.)

       THE CURTAIN FALLS RAPIDLY.


FINALE.

               (Entra Alfio.)

 _Alfio._ A voi tutti salute.

 _Coro._ Compar Alfio, salute.

 _Turiddu._ Benvenuto! con noi dovete bere,

                   (Empie un bicchiere.)

                Ecco pieno è il bicchiere.

                       (Troncando.)

 _Alfio._ Grazie, ma il vostro vino io non l'accetto,
               Diverrebbe veleno entro il mio petto!

 _Turiddu._

                      (Parlato.)

            A piacer vostro.

                    (Getto il vino.)

 _Lola._ Ahimè che mai sarà?

(Alcune donne nel Coro si consigliano fra loro poi si av
vicinano a Lola dicendole sotto voce.)

 _Coro._ Comare Lola, andiamo via di qua.

           (Tutte le donne escono conducendo Lola.)

 _Turiddu._ Avete altro a dirmi?

 _Alfio._ Io nulla.

 _Turiddu._ Allota sono agli ordini vostri--

 _Alfio._ Or ora?

 _Turiddu._ Or ora!

    (Si abbracciano. Turiddu morde l'orecchio destro di Alfio.)

 _Alfio._ Compar Turiddu, a vete morso, a buono!

                (Con intenzione.)

              Cintenderemo bene a quel che pare!

 _Turiddu._ Compar Alfio.
                Lo so che il torto è mio;
                E ve lo giuro nel nome di Dio
                Che al par d'un cane mi farei sgozzar--
                    Ma s'io non vivo,

                     (Dolorosamente.)


                Resta abbandonata povera Santa!
                Lei che mi s'è data!

                     (Con impeto.)

                Vi saprò in core il ferro mio piantar!

 _Alfio._

                  (Freddamente.)

          Compare fate come più vi piace,
          Io v'aspetto qui fuori dietro l'orto.

                       (Esce.)

 _Turiddu._

                     (Chiamando.)

                Mamma--

                    (Entra Lucia.)

                Mamma--quel vino è generoso,
                E certo oggi troppi bicchier
                Ne ho traccannati--
                Vado fuori all' aperto--
                Ma prima voglio che mi benedite--
                Come quel giorno che partii soldato:
                E poi mamma,
                Sentite, s'io non tornassi--
                Voi dovrete fare da madre a Santa,
                Ch'io le avea giurato di condurla all' altare.

 _Lucia._   Perchè parli cosi, figliolo mio?

 _Turiddu._

                   (Con disinvoltura.)

                Oh! nulla, è il vino che m'ha suggerito!
                M'ha suggerito il vino--
                Per me pregate Iddio,
                Un bacio mamma! un altro bacio
                Addio!

                  (Fugge disperatamente.)

 _Lucia._ Turiddu! che vuoi dire!

     (Va in fondo alla scena a disperatamente chiama.)

              Turiddu! Turiddu! ah!

                    (Entra Santuzza.)

                  Santuzza.

 _Santuzza._ Oh! madre mia!

(Le getta le braccia al colla. La scena si popolo. L'agitazione si
scorge sul volto di tutti. Che scambievolmente s'interrogano con
terrore. Si ode un mormorio confuso da lontano. Una donna sola,
assai lontano, gridando.)

                  Hanno ammazzato compare Turiddu!

(Si sentono delle voci confuse più vicine. Alcune donne entrano
atterrite correndo, ed una di esse grida disperatamente.)

            Hanno ammazzato compare Turiddu!

         (Tutti si precipitano sulla scena.)

 _Santuzza, Lucia e Coro._

                   (Gridando.)

            Ah!

(Santuzza cade priva di sensi, Lucia sviene ed è sorretta
dalle donne del Coro. Tutti restano atterriti.)

This notable collection of twenty-seven choruses, one hundred and
twenty-eight music pages, contains sixteen secular numbers and eleven
sacred. The names of the distinguished editors are a guarantee of the
high quality of the book. Care has been taken to avoid music of more
than average difficulty, or of extreme vocal range.

Every number was chosen because of its intrinsic beauty as well as
singableness. The interesting _Foreword_ by the managing editor records
the development of _a cappella_ music in this country.

Unparalleled in both quality and price.

_Each number is also issued separately_




THE JUNIOR A CAPPELLA CHORUS BOOK

_Edited by_ OLAF C. CHRISTIANSEN AND CAROL M. PITTS

FOR MIXED VOICES _Price, in Boards_, $1.00

Contains one hundred and twenty-eight pages of music, an elaborate and
helpful Foreword, and _Hints for the Singers_ by Dr. Hollis Dann.

Of the fifty-one musical numbers, forty-two are secular and nine are
sacred. More than half are made available in _a cappella_ form for the
first time.

As the best possible preparation for acquiring independent movement
of voices accustomed only to part-songs that move solidly together,
the book opens with fifteen canons, rounds, and catches by Byrd,
Hayes, Haydn, Hilton, Purcell, and others. These are followed by two
canzonets of Morley (two-part) and three-part (S. A. B.) choruses by
Shield and Ford and arrangements of folksongs. The body of the book
consists of four-part madrigals, folksongs, two Negro spirituals, and
other choruses. Several five-part songs are included. Morley, Weelkes,
Pilkington, Bennet, Gevaert, Lully, Praetorius, Mozart, Bortniansky,
Archangelsky, Sibelius, and others are represented.

While the musical standard of the editors is high, pains have been taken
to selectmusic that not only is suitable in range and text for junior
choruses, but is hearty, joyous, and singable.

This truly significant volume will fill a great need, and be the
happiest possible introduction to the art of unaccompanied chorus
singing.

NEW CHORAL WORKS

WRITTEN FOR SCHOOLS


=BIZET, GEORGES=

 =Choral Fantasia from Carmen= (Arranged by N. Clifford Page)       .50

No opera has more numbers that are known and loved for their piquant
rhythms and exquisite melodies than Bizet's masterpiece. It teems with
color and life. The editor has introduced all the best of these and in
the logical order in which they appear in the score. Solos, trios and
choruses are all present in an easy choral arrangement, which closes
brilliantly with the famous Toreador March.


=GOUNOD, CHARLES=

 =Choral Fantasia from Faust= (Arranged by N. Clifford Page)        .50

The arranger has cleverly contrived that all the best known solos,
concerted numbers and chorus are included in this fantasia, in the
order in which they appear in the opera. All are treated chorally, and
difficulties are so treated that high schools and popular choruses may
perform the work.


=COERNE, LOUIS ADOLPHE=

 =Skipper Ireson's Ride= (Cantata for Mixed Voices)                 .30

To Whittier's stirring ballad, based on a quaint incident in an old New
England past, the composer has made attractive and ingenious music,
especially adapted for performance by schools and amateur societies.


=HOSMER, E. S.=

 =Columbus= (Cantata for Mixed Voices)
                (Also issued for Men's Voices)                     .40

A short and easy work, the music melodious though not without dramatic
touches. It calls for a solo baritone. The part writing makes large use
of unisons, and awkward progressions have been avoided.

(Also issued for men's voices)

The Clippinger Class-Method of Voice Culture

_by_ D. A. CLIPPINGER

An altogether sane, balanced and practical text book by one of America's
eminent authorities on the voice. It contains 132 pages of instructive
text, technical exercises, melodic studies, and carefully chosen songs
and duets.

The author's deep study of the voice together with his long experience
in solving difficult vocal problems in the studio has enabled him to
rid the subject of vagary, mystery, and uncertainty, and state the
principles of voice-training so clearly and simply that they may be
understood by anyone.


A FEW BASIC PRINCIPLES

A tone is _something to hear_. Therefore, to be right it must satisfy
the trained ear.

A good tone is _easily produced_. It is the bad tone that is difficult.

A considerable part of voice-training must be devoted to _getting rid of
resistance_, that is, effort at the wrong point.

Good voice-production is based on the _right idea_ of tone and right
conditions of the instrument.

The study of singing should be _an invigorating and inspiring form_ of
exercise.

To sing _well_ is an accomplishment _well_ worth the time and effort
involved.


AIM OF THE BOOK

An adequate treatment of breath-control, vowel-formation, vowel-color,
tone-quality, resonance, consonants, phonetic spelling, diction, the
head voice.

Ample exercises for flexibility.

An illuminating discussion of interpretation, and how to study a song.

An outline of the principles of interpretation as a basis of criticism.

Purchase of outside material unnecessary.

The book is COMPLETE in itself, with ample text, nearly 150 exercises
and studies, 25 songs and 7 duets.

 PRICE, $1.25


For Additional Teaching Material

_Art Songs for School and Studio_ (FIRST YEAR)

EDITED BY MABELLE GLENN and ALFRED SPOUSE

 Issued in Two Editions--Medium High--Medium Low--$1.00 each


_Art Songs for School and Studio_ (SECOND YEAR)

_Edited by_ MABELLE GLENN and ALFRED SPOUSE

 Issued in two editions--Medium High--Medium Low--$1.00 _each_

Because of the success of the _First Year_ book and the demand for a
second book, a step in advance, this collection has been issued. It
contains twenty-three second-year songs, including two duets, from the
works of Brahms, Densmore, Franz, Fisher, Grieg, Henschel, Jensen,
Manney, Schubert, Schumann, Sinding, Strickland, Tchaikovsky and Watts.

The editors have added helpful notes to each of the songs and the volume
includes hints on Teaching Procedure, Diction, and the Principles of
Singing.

What Educators have said regarding Professor Hamilton's

MUSIC APPRECIATION

=Sumner Salter=, _Director of Music_, Williams College:

"I am convinced of the skill and thoroughness of treatment and of the
far reaching practical value of the work."

=Walter H. Aiken=, _Director of Music_, Cincinnati, Ohio:

"One of the best, in my opinion, of anything thus far in print leading
to music appreciation through music analysis: telling the pupil what to
study and how."

=Arthur Foote=, Boston, Mass.

"The scheme is a new one and seems to me of much practical value. The
analyses are lucid and just the thing to teach the pupil how to think
and work out such matters for himself."

=H. D. Sleeper=, _Professor of Music_, Smith College:

"Capitally planned and carried out to meet a very definite need--the
awakening of intelligence regarding good music in the minds of young
people of high school and college age."

=Joseph N. Ashton=, _Director of Music_, Abbott Academy, Andover, Mass.,
formerly Professor of Music, Brown University:

"An admirable book. The music selected as a basis of study is such as
the student would be expected to be acquainted with. The scheme avoids
on the one side mechanical dryness and on the other vague and valueless
rhapsody. With this book sterile study is well-nigh impossible."

=Mrs. Frank A. Seiberling=, _President_ National Federation of Music
Clubs:

"The book will be invaluable to use in music clubs as a means of getting
a fundamental understanding of the history of music and the various
forms of compositions. When our next pamphlet goes out to the clubs of
our national federation I shall list the book for use as a reference
manual for the entire season for club study."

=Dr. Percy Goetschius=, Institute of Musical Art, New York City:

"I am _thoroughly delighted_ with the book. It is an original, very
sensible and practical method of approaching this important subject;
it is admirably planned and its comprehensive contents admirably
systematized; and it is written with a delightful mixture of simplicity
and erudition that makes it both easy to use and appealing to the
student."

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
