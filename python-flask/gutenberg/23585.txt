佛說四十二章經

後漢摩騰、竺法蘭共譯

世尊成道已，作是思惟：離欲寂靜，是最為勝。住大禪定，降諸魔道。於鹿野苑中，
轉四諦法輪，度憍陳如等五人而證道果。復有比丘所說諸疑，求佛進止。世尊教敕，
一一開悟。合掌敬諾，而順尊敕。

佛言：辭親出家，識心達本，解無為法，名曰沙門。常行二百五十戒，進止清淨，為
四真道行，成阿羅漢。阿羅漢者，能飛行變化，曠劫壽命，住動天地。次為阿那含。
阿那含者，壽終靈神上十九天。證阿羅漢。次為斯陀含。斯陀含者，一上一還，即得
阿羅漢。次為須陀洹。須陀洹者，七死七生，便證阿羅漢。愛欲斷者，如四肢斷，不
復用之。

佛言：出家沙門者，斷欲去愛，識自心源，達佛深理，悟無為法。內無所得，外無所
求。心不繫道，亦不結業。無念無作，非修非證。不歷諸位，而自崇最。名之為道。

佛言：剃除鬚髮而為沙門，受道法者，去世資財，乞求取足。日中一食，樹下一宿，
慎勿再矣！使人愚蔽者，愛與欲也。

佛言：眾生以十事為善，亦以十事為惡。何等為十？身三、口四、意三。身三者，殺
盜婬。口四者，兩舌、惡口、妄言、綺語。意三者，嫉恚癡。如是十事，不順聖道，
名十惡行。是惡若止，名十善行耳。

佛言：人有眾過，而不自悔、頓息其心，罪來赴身；如水歸海，漸成深廣。若人有過
，自解知非，改惡行善，罪自消滅；如病得汗，漸有痊損耳。

佛言：惡人聞善，故來擾亂者，汝自禁息，當無瞋責，彼來惡者而自惡之。

佛言：有人聞吾守道，行大仁慈，故致罵佛。佛默不對。罵止，問曰：子以禮從人，
其人不納，禮歸子乎？對曰：歸矣！佛言：今子罵我，我今不納，子自持禍歸子身矣
！猶響應聲，影之隨形，終無免離，慎勿為惡。

佛言：惡人害賢者，猶仰天而唾，唾不至天，還從已墮；逆風揚塵，塵不至彼，還坌
己身。賢不可毀，禍必滅己。

佛言：博聞愛道，道必難會；守志奉道，其道甚大。

佛言：睹人施道，助之歡喜，得福甚大。沙門問曰：此福盡乎？佛言：譬如一炬之火
，數千百人各以炬來分取，熟食除冥，此炬如故；福亦如之。

佛言：飯惡人百，不如飯一善人；飯善人千，不如飯一持五戒者；飯五戒者萬，不如
飯一須陀洹；飯百萬須陀洹，不如飯一斯陀含；飯千萬斯陀含，不如飯一阿那含；飯
一億阿那含，不如飯一阿羅漢；飯十億阿羅漢，不如飯一辟支佛；飯百億辟支佛，不
如飯一三世諸佛；飯千億三世諸佛，不如飯一無念無住無修無證之者。

佛言：人有二十難。貧窮布施難，豪貴學道難，棄命必死難，得睹佛經難，生值佛世
難，忍色忍欲難，見好不求難，被辱不瞋難，有勢不臨難，觸事無心難，廣學博究難
，除滅我慢難，不輕未學難，心行平等難，不說是非難，會善知識難，見性學道難，
隨化度人難，睹境不動難，善解方便難。

沙門問佛：以何因緣，得知宿命，會其至道？佛言：淨心守志，可會至道。譬如磨鏡
，垢去明存；斷欲無求，當得宿命。

沙門問佛：何者為善？何者最大？佛言：行道守真者善，志與道合者大。

沙門問佛：何者多力？何者最明？佛言：忍辱多力，不懷惡故，兼加安健。忍者無惡
，必為人尊。心垢滅盡，淨無瑕穢，是為最明。未有天地，逮於今日；十方所有，無
有不見，無有不知，無有不聞，得一切智，可謂明矣！

佛言：人懷愛欲，不見道者，譬如澄水，致手攪之，眾人共臨，無有睹其影者。人以
愛欲交錯，心中濁興，故不見道。汝等沙門，當捨愛欲。愛欲垢盡，道可見矣！

佛言：夫見道者，譬如持炬，入冥室中，其冥即滅，而明獨存；學道見諦，無明即滅
，而明常存矣！

佛言：吾法念無念念、行無行行、言無言言、修無修修，會者近爾，迷者遠乎！言語
道斷，非物所拘，差之毫釐，失之須臾。

佛言：觀天地，念非常。觀世界，念非常。觀靈覺，即菩提。如是知識，得道疾矣！

佛言：當念身中四大，各有自名，都無我者。我既都無，其如幻耳！

佛言：人隨情欲，求於聲名；聲名顯著，身已故矣！貪世常名而不學道，枉功勞形。
譬如燒香，雖人聞香，香之燼矣！危身之火，而在其後。

佛言：財色於人，人之不捨。譬如刀刃有蜜，不足一餐之美；小兒舐之，則有割舌之
患。

佛言：人繫於妻子舍宅，甚於牢獄。牢獄有散釋之期，妻子無遠離之念。情愛於色，
豈憚驅馳！雖有虎口之患，心存甘伏，投泥自溺，故曰凡夫。透得此門，出塵羅漢。

佛言：愛欲莫甚於色。色之為欲，其大無外，賴有一矣。若使二同，普天之人，無能
為道者矣。

佛言：愛欲於人，猶如執炬逆風而行，必有燒手之患。

天神獻玉女於佛，欲壞佛意。佛言：革囊眾穢，爾來何為？去！吾不用。天神愈敬，
因問道意。佛為解說，即得須陀洹果。

佛言：夫為道者，猶木在水，尋流而行。不觸兩岸，不為人取，不為鬼神所遮，不為
洄流所住，亦不腐敗，吾保此木決定入海。學道之人，不為情欲所惑，不為眾邪所嬈
，精進無為，吾保此人必得道矣。

佛言：甚勿信汝意，汝意不可信。慎勿與色會，色會即禍生。得阿羅漢已，乃可信汝
意。

佛言：慎勿視女色，亦莫共言語。若與語者，正心思念：我為沙門，處於濁世，當如
蓮華，不為泥汙。想其老者為母，長者如姊，少者如妹，稚者如子。生度脫心，息滅
惡念。

佛言：夫為道者，如被乾草，火來須避。道人見欲，必當遠之。

佛言：有人患婬不止，欲自斷陰。佛謂之曰：若斷其陰，不如斷心。心如功曹，功曹
若止，從者都息。邪心不止，斷陰何益？佛為說偈：欲生於汝意，意以思想生，二心
各寂靜，非色亦非行。佛言：此偈是迦葉佛說。

佛言：人從愛欲生憂，從憂生怖。若離於愛，何憂何怖？

佛言：夫為道者，譬如一人與萬人戰。挂鎧出門，意或怯弱，或半路而退，或格鬥而
死，或得勝而還。沙門學道，應當堅持其心，精進勇銳，不畏前境，破滅眾魔，而得
道果。

沙門夜誦迦葉佛遺教經，其聲悲緊，思悔欲退。佛問之曰：汝昔在家，曾為何業？對
曰：愛彈琴。佛言：弦緩如何？對曰：不鳴矣！弦急如何？對曰：聲絕矣！急緩得中
如何？對曰：諸音普矣！佛言：沙門學道亦然，心若調適，道可得矣。於道若暴，暴
即身疲。其身若疲，意即生惱。意若生惱，行即退矣。其行既退，罪必加矣。但清淨
安樂，道不失矣。

佛言：如人鍛鐵，去滓成器，器即精好。學道之人，去心垢染，行即清淨矣。

佛言：人離惡道，得為人難。既得為人，去女即男難。既得為男，六根完具難。六根
既具，生中國難。既生中國，值佛世難。既值佛世，遇道者難。既得遇道，興信心難
。既興信心，發菩提心難。既發菩提心，無修無證難。

佛言：佛子離吾數千里，憶念吾戒，必得道果。在吾左右，雖常見吾，不順吾戒，終
不得道。

佛問沙門：人命在幾間？對曰：數日間。佛言：子未知道。復問一沙門：人命在幾間
？對曰：飯食間。佛言：子未知道。復問一沙門：人命在幾間？對曰：呼吸間。佛言
：善哉，子知道矣！

佛言：學佛道者，佛所言說，皆應信順。譬如食蜜，中邊皆甜；吾經亦爾。

佛言：沙門行道，無如磨牛；身雖行道，心道不行。心道若行，何用行道。

佛言：夫為道者，如牛負重。行深泥中，疲極不敢左右顧視；出離淤泥，乃可蘇息。
沙門當觀情欲，甚於淤泥。直心念道，可免苦矣。

佛言：吾視王侯之位，如過隙塵。視金玉之寶，如瓦礫。視籸素之服，如敝帕。視大
千界，如一訶子。視阿耨池水，如塗足油。視方便門，如化寶聚。視無上乘，如夢金
帕。視佛道，如眼前華。視禪定，如須彌柱。視涅槃，如晝夕寤。視倒正，如六龍舞
。視平等，如一真地。視興化，如四時木。



佛言：人隨情欲，求於聲名；聲名顯著，身已故矣！貪世常名而不學道，枉功勞形。譬如燒香，雖人聞香，香之燼矣！危身之火，而在其後。

佛言：財色於人，人之不捨。譬如刀刃有蜜，不足一餐之美；小兒舐之，則有割舌之患。

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
