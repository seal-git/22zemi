The systematic status of the populations of lizards assignable to
_Cnemidophorus sacki_ in western México (Sonora southward to Jalisco)
has been reviewed in detail by Zweifel (1959, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
Hist, 117 (2):57-116), who stated that the use of the specific name
_sacki_ for the western populations rests upon a reasonable, but as
yet unproved, assumption that intergradation occurs. Although Zweifel
examined specimens of the nominal subspecies from the upper Balsas
Basin, he did not study specimens from the intervening area--the
Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacán.

Field studies and the examination of large series of preserved
specimens of _Cnemidophorus_ from the Tepalcatepec Valley show the
presence of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the region between the ranges of
_C. sacki sacki_ in the upper Balsas Basin and _C. sacki occidentalis_
in Jalisco and southern Nayarit. Furthermore, the populations of
_sacki_ inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley have characters of
scutellation and coloration that distinguish them from other described
subspecies of _sacki_. In recognition of the important contributions
to the systematics of the genus _Cnemidophorus_ made by Dr. Richard G.
Zweifel, I propose that the subspecies of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the
Tepalcatepec Valley be named as follows:


             +Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli+ new subspecies

_Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 119542, from
Capirio, Michoacán, México (185 meters), an adult male, one of a
series collected on June 13, 1958, by William E. Duellman, Jerome B.
Tulecke, and John Wellman. Original number WED 12310.

_Paratopotypes._--UMMZ Nos. 119536-119541 and 119543-119550.

_Diagnosis._--A race of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ characterized by large
size (more than 130 mm. snout-vent length in males), approximately 106
dorsal granules around the midbody, about 41 femoral pores, and a
dorsal color-pattern in adult males consisting of lateral and
dorsolateral rows of spots, paravertebral rows fused with middorsal
light green area at least anteriorly, and pink throat having a median
light blue spot or transverse band.

_Description of Holotype._--Snout-vent length, 128 mm.; tail length,
252 mm.; tail/body ratio, 1.97; scutellation typical of _sacki_--four
supraoculars, enlarged postantebrachials, and enlarged mesoptychials;
107 granules around midbody (excluding enlarged ventrals); 45 femoral
pores; three enlarged preanal scales; supraorbital semicircle-series
extending anteriorly to posterior edge of frontal (Fig. 1).


    [Illustration: Top View Head - Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli]

~Fig. 1.~ Top view of the head of the holotype of _Cnemidophorus sacki
    zweifeli_ (UMMZ 119542) showing scutellation. ×5.


Top of head and nape dusty brown; tip of rostral and lateral edges of
superciliaries dark cream-color; upper labials and sides of head
anterior to eyes cream-color, mottled with blue; lower labials and
postocular region pale blue; mental, postmental, and sublabials
cream-color. Upper surfaces of forelimbs dull bluish gray, spotted
with pale greenish yellow; dorsal surfaces of proximal one-fourth of
tail light brownish gray turning to pale orange-brown posteriorly;
lateral surfaces of tail bluish gray anteriorly and creamy brown
posteriorly. Nuchal region light bluish gray; flanks dark gray; dorsal
ground-color dark brown, somewhat paler posteriorly. Body having a row
of cream-colored spots in place of a lateral stripe, and another row
in place of dorsolateral stripe; dorsally, large diffuse tan or light
green spots partially fused and tending to form irregular transverse
markings. Chin to posterior end of sublabials pale pink, bordered
posteriorly by bluish white area, and then pink. Mesoptychials, under
surfaces of hind limbs, and belly cream-colored; anterior edges of
belly scales dark blue; lateral two rows of ventrals on posterior
two-thirds of body dark blue having light blue or cream-colored spots.
Under surfaces of forelimbs bluish cream; ventral surface of tail
cream-colored.

_Variation in Size and Scutellation._--The largest male has a
snout-vent length of 132 mm., the largest female, 114 mm., and the
smallest juvenile, 34 mm. The number of dorsal granules at the midbody
varies from 91 to 117 (106.2 ± 0.43); the ratio of the number of
granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules
around the body (PV/GAB) varies from 0.064 to 0.157 (0.097 ±0.007);
the number of femoral pores varies from 32 to 49 (41.1 ± 0.20).
Usually there are only three enlarged preanals, but 18 specimens have
a somewhat enlarged scale anterior to the normal complement of three.
In 15 specimens the supraorbital semicircle-series terminate short of
the posterior edge of the frontal; in the others the series reach the
frontal.

_Variation in Coloration._--The coloration of juveniles and subadults
varies little; large adults vary considerably especially in the amount
of diffusion of the light green middorsal area. In some individuals
the vertebral pale area does not include the paravertebral spots; in
other individuals the pale area includes not only the paravertebral
rows, but, at least anteriorly, the dorsolateral rows. In large males
of about equal size (and collected at the same time) there is
considerable variation in the amount of blue on the belly. In a few of
the males the belly is white with only the anterior edge of each scale
blue; in some only the lateral rows of ventrals on the posterior
two-thirds of the body are blue; in others all of the posterior
two-thirds of the belly is blue.

_Ontogenetic Change in Color Pattern._--The metamorphosis of color
pattern in _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ results in the dorsal
ground-color becoming paler with age, the replacement of the stripes
by spots, and finally in large males the suffusion of these spots.

A single hatchling (UMMZ 114732) is available; this specimen has a
prominent umbilical scar and a snout-vent length of 34 mm. The top of
the head is olive brown; the dorsal surfaces of the limbs are dark
brown with cream mottling; the dorsal ground-color is brownish black;
this is paler on the lower flanks. The lateral and dorsolateral
stripes are cream-colored; the paravertebral stripes are white. There
is a faint, diffuse vertebral stripe anteriorly (Fig. 2 A). The throat
and undersides of the limbs and tail are cream-colored; the belly is
bluish white. In life the stripes were pale yellowish green, and the
tip of the tail was pink.

In larger individuals the dorsal ground-color is dark brown; the
lower flanks are grayish tan. Light brown diffuse spots are present
in the lateral and dorsolateral dark fields. The tan vertebral stripe
is diffuse and nearly fills the paravertebral dark fields; the
paravertebral stripes are faint posteriorly; throughout their length
they are scalloped--the beginning of their fragmentation into spots
(Fig. 2 B).

In subadults (± 80 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral stripes
are fragmented into spots posteriorly. Also, the dorsolateral stripes
in some individuals are fragmented posteriorly. The dorsolateral dark
fields are somewhat paler than the lateral dark fields. Cream-colored
spots are present on the flanks. The mottling on the thighs tends
towards the formation of light spots (Fig. 2 C).

In small adults (± 100 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral
stripes are entirely fragmented into spots. The lateral and
dorsolateral stripes are broken into spots posteriorly. The middorsal
pale area (formed by the suffusion of the vertebral stripe) and
paravertebral and dorsolateral rows of spots are pale green. The
cream-colored spots on the flanks are expanded to form vertical bars
(Fig. 2 D).

Large adult males (± 120 mm. snout-vent length) have all of the
stripes fragmented into spots. The diffuse middorsal area is expanded
and encloses the paravertebral rows of spots. The pale spots present
in the dark fields in smaller individuals are either absent or fused
with spots resulting from the fragmentation of the stripes (Fig. 2 E).

_Sexual dimorphism._--Males attain a larger size (known maximum
snout-vent length of 132 mm., as compared with 114 mm. in females).
Males have larger but not more numerous, femoral pores, blue bellies,
and pink and blue throats, whereas females are unicolor creamy white
ventrally. The more nearly complete metamorphosis of color pattern
exhibited by adult males probably is correlated with their large adult
size. Large females retain complete lateral and dorsolateral stripes.
The jowls of breeding males are swollen.

    C--subadult male, 80 mm. snout-vent length; D--small adult male,
    100 mm. snout-vent length; E--large adult male, 120 mm. snout-vent
    length.


_Geographic variation._--No noticeable geographic variation in this
subspecies is evident in the series from the Tepalcatepec Valley.
However, lizards from eastern Michoacán (Chinapa, 6 km. N of Tafetan,
6 km. S of Tzitzio, and 19 km. S of Tzitzio) differ slightly from
those from the Tepalcatepec Valley; the eastern specimens have fewer
dorsal granules and femoral pores, and a higher ratio of dorsal
granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules
around the body (see Tables 1-3). No large adult males are present in
the eastern series; the subadults and small adult males have color
patterns like lizards of similar size from the Tepalcatepec Valley.
The largest male from the east has a snout-vent length of 110 mm.,
rows of pale spots, and no trace of brown and tan cross-bars.
Specimens of _Cnemidophorus sacki sacki_ of equal size from Guerrero,
Morelos, and Puebla in the upper Balsas Basin have a tan dorsum with
dark brown cross-bars. The localities in eastern Michoacán are
intermediate geographically between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the
known range of the nominal subspecies in the upper Balsas Basin. In
characters of scutellation specimens from the east are intermediate
between _C. sacki sacki_ and _C. sacki zweifeli_ in the Tepalcatepec
Valley. However, in coloration the lizards from the east are like
those from the Tepalcatepec Valley, but differ distinctly from the
nominal subspecies. Therefore, the eastern series is referred to the
subspecies _C. sacki zweifeli_.

_Comparisons._--Four other species of _Cnemidophorus_ occur in the
Tepalcatepec Valley with _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_. Of these, _C.
calidipes_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 79 mm., 66 to 86 dorsal
granules, and a light brown dorsum with pale blue spots and vertical
bars; _C. communis communis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 135
mm., 105 to 144 dorsal granules, and a greenish tan dorsum with yellow
spots; _C. deppei infernalis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 84
mm., 91 to 120 dorsal granules, and a striped pattern throughout life;
and _C. lineatissimus exoristus_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 98
mm., 108 to 135 dorsal granules, and a middorsal yellow stripe and
vertical bars on the flanks. Both _calidipes_ and _communis_ are like
_sacki_ in possessing four enlarged supraoculars and enlarged
postantebrachials, whereas _deppei_ and _lineatissimus_ have three
enlarged supraoculars and granular postantebrachials. Juveniles of
_calidipes_ and _sacki_ are alike in coloration but different in the
extent of the supraorbital semicircle-series. In _calidipes_ the
supraorbital semicircle-series usually are complete, whereas in
_sacki_ the series never extended anterior to the posterior edge of
the frontal.

From the geographically adjacent populations of _sacki_ (_sacki_ and
_occidentalis_), _zweifeli_ differs in coloration and scutellation
(see Tables I-III). _Cnemidophorus sacki sacki_ has a dorsal pattern
in adult males of dark brown cross-bars on a tan ground-color. Both
_occidentalis_ and _zweifeli_ have variable, diffuse color patterns
in large adults, but _zweifeli_ differs from _occidentalis_ in having
a blue spot on the pink throat.

_Ecology._--In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley _Cnemidophorus sacki
zweifeli_ lives at elevations of 160 to 1300 meters. In the lower
parts of the valley the lizards live primarily in open scrub forests,
characterized by deciduous trees offering only partial shade from the
sun, especially during the prolonged dry season. Common trees in
this scrub forest are _Acacia cymbispina_, _Cercidium
plurifoliolatum_, _Mimosa distachya_, and _Prosopis juliflora_.

During the dry season (November through May) adult males apparently
aestivate; several large series collected in the winter include only
subadults and females. This absence of males is corroborated by
personal observations in the Tepalcatepec Valley in April and May. In
the summer rainy season the lizards are active in the morning and
again in the late afternoon; only _Cnemidophorus calidipes_ is active
during the heat of the midday. In some areas of the scrub forest
_Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ is found in association with
_Cnemidophorus communis communis_. Throughout the scrub forest _C.
sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. deppei infernalis_. In some of the
more dense scrub forest, where _C. sacki zweifeli_ is not so abundant
as in the more open forest, it has been taken with _C. lineatissimus
exoristus_. In the open _Acacia-Cercidium_ associations on the valley
floor _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. calidipes_.

This subspecies is not restricted to the scrub forest. On the lower
slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacán _C. sacki zweifeli_
has been collected in open pine-oak forest near Zirimicuaro and
Ziracuaretiro.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
