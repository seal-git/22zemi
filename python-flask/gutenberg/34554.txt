Preparation of a handbook of reptiles and amphibians by the junior
author has led to a survey of the collections of these animals at Kansas
State Teachers College in Emporia. Numerous locality records of interest
and importance have been accumulated there through the efforts of the
senior author and a number of his students, particularly Mr. Allen
Downs. The more important records, including the first record for Kansas
of _Rana sylvatica_, are reported here. We have not mentioned specimens
that are from counties from which the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History already has specimens.

Specimens examined by Smith are indicated by an asterisk *; those
identified by the late Dr. F. N. Blanchard are indicated by an encircled
period ¤ (none of these specimens are now available). All other
specimens here recorded have been examined either by the senior author
or by Mr. Allen Downs, or by both. Specimen numbers, unless otherwise
indicated, are those of the Kansas State Teachers College collection.

#Triturus viridescens louisianensis# (Wolterstorff), Newt.--_Cherokee
Co._: 1 mile north and 4 miles east of Crestline (No. 164).* This is a
terrestrial adult, and provides the second known locality for the
species in the state.

#Ambystoma texanum# (Matthes), Narrow-mouthed Salamander.--_Lyon Co._:
Emporia.

west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 592).

#Bufo americanus americanus# (Holbrook), American Toad.--_Chase Co._: 10
miles southwest of Saffordville. _Cherokee Co._: 4 miles southeast of
Columbus. _Lyon Co._: 6 miles south of Plymouth (No. 290)*; Emporia
(Nos. 442, 443).* The records from Chase and Lyon counties represent the
westernmost localities for the species in Kansas.

#Bufo cognatus# Say, Great Plains Toad.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and
1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 594).

#Bufo woodhousii woodhousii# (Girard), Rocky Mountain Toad.--_Clark
Co._: 11 miles south of Bucklin (No. 401).* _Decatur Co._: Sappa Creek
near Oberlin (2 spec.).* _Ford. Co._: 5 miles southwest of Dodge City (1
spec.).* _Lyon Co._: Emporia (No. 352).* _Ness Co._: Ness City (Nos.
502-504, 595, 596)*; 4 miles west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No.
593).* _Sheridan Co._: Sheridan County State Park (Nos. 565-568).

#Acris crepitans# Baird, Northern Cricket Frog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles
west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 506, 507, 597-606).*

#Pseudacris nigrita triseriata# (Wied), Striped Chorus Frog.--_Lyon
Co._: 10 miles south of Plymouth; 3 miles north of Emporia (No. 300); 7
miles west of Olpe; 2 miles northeast of Emporia (Nos. 434-441).*
_Neosho Co._: 3 miles west of Erie.

#Hyla versicolor versicolor# (Le Conte), Common Tree Toad.--_Chautauqua
Co._: Elk City (No. 621).

#Rana catesbeiana# Shaw, Bullfrog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5
miles north of Ness City (No. 607).* _Wallace Co._: 3 miles east of
Sharon Springs (1 spec.).*

#Rana pipiens brachycephala# Cope, Leopard Frog.--_Clark Co._: 11 miles
south of Bucklin (Nos. 398-400).* _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles
north of Ness City (Nos. 505, 508, 509, 608).*

#Rana sylvatica cantabrigensis# Baird, Wood Frog.--_Lyon Co._: extreme
southwestern corner, 3 miles east of Chase County line, between the
Verdigris River and the corner of the county (1 specimen, now Mus. Nat.
Hist., Univ. Kans., No. 23149).* This specimen provides for the first
time a basis for inclusion of the species in the fauna of Kansas. It
measures 50 mm. snout to vent; hind leg from vent 80 mm.; tibia 23 mm.
The ratio of hind leg to snout-vent measurement is 0.625, and that of
the tibia to snout-vent measurement is 2.17. Both figures are too high
for _Rana s. sylvatica_, in which the former ratio varies between 0.53
and 0.62, the latter ratio between 1.6 and 1.88. The ratios agree well
with those of _R. s. cantabrigensis_, in which the former ratio varies
from 0.62 to 0.75, the latter from 1.93 to 2.3. Direct comparison of the
specimen with typical examples of both subspecies substantiates its
allocation to _R. s. cantabrigensis_.

In the vicinity of Kansas, specimens of this species are known from
Missouri (St. Louis and Stone Counties only) and northwestern Arkansas
(Washington County: Winslow and Prairie Grove, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.
Kans., Nos. 16526, 18820, 18823). Reëxamination of these specimens
confirms their identity as _Rana sylvatica sylvatica_ to which the
Missouri specimens from Stone County undoubtedly also belong.
Accordingly this race is still to be anticipated in extreme southeastern
Kansas.

Reference of the specimen from Lyon County to _Rana s. cantabrigensis_
presents a problem in distribution, for the race is not known from
nearer Kansas than North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and southern
Illinois, except for a record given by Cope (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No.
34:437, 1889) from "western Missouri." Hurter (Trans. St. Louis Acad.
Sci., 20:123, 1911) restricts this record to Cooper County, and
presumably verifies Cope's identification. Hurter, too, recognized the
other form, _R. sylvatica_, in Missouri (Marble Cave, Stone County).
Cope distinguished between the two races (as they are now recognized)
and recorded typical _R. sylvatica_ from St. Louis. Accordingly the
specimen from Cooper County may be considered properly identified
racially. It apparently is from the locality nearest to Kansas at which
the race has been taken.

It seems highly probable that the Kansas occurrence, and possibly those
in Arkansas and Missouri also, is a relict one. It is highly improbable
that the species has a continuous distribution in either state. A wider
or more southern distribution in the past seems evident. The group to
which it belongs certainly has had a more southern range, as indicated
by Taylor's discovery in Meade County, Kansas (Univ. Kans. Sci. Bull.,
28:217, 1942), of a fossil species of _Rana_ (_parvissima_), from the
Upper Pliocene, presumably related to _sylvatica_. It may or may not
have been a direct ancestor of the living species.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
