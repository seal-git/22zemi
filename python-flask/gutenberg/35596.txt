Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the needle with which to bind

the needle and thread through the center of the book, leaving an end
extend outside, then through to the outside, about 2 inches from the
center; then from the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally again through the
center, and tie the two ends in a knot, one each side of the cord on the

                          HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

                   *       *       *       *       *

This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT
MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives
of the Great Composers for Children," "Music Talks with Children,"
"First Studies in Music Biography," and others.

The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the
child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place
throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as
will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to
cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the
corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around
each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.

After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the
book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the
great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous
pages.

The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the
cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's
own book.

This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting
task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to
the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth
while.

                     The Story of the Boy Who Made
                           Pictures in Music.


When Robert Schumann was a boy he used to amuse his friends by playing
their pictures on the piano. He could make the music imitate the person.

One day he said to them: This is the way the farmer walks when he comes
home singing from his work.

                          [Illustration: No. 2
                           THE HAPPY FARMER.]

Some day you will be able to play a lot of pieces by Schumann that
picture the pleasantest things so clearly that you can see them very
plainly indeed. In one of his books there is a music picture of a boy
riding a rocking horse.

Another of a little girl falling asleep.

_A March for Little Soldiers._ (That is, make-believes.)

And then there are _Sitting by the Fireside_, _What they Sing in
Church_, and a piece the first four notes of which spell the name of a
composer who was a good friend of Schumann's.

This composer came from Denmark.

                          [Illustration: No. 3
                              NIELS GADE.]

This is a picture of the house in Zwickau, Germany, where Robert
Schumann was born.

                          [Illustration: No. 4
                        SCHUMANN'S BIRTHPLACE.]

Schumann was a strong healthy youth who had many friends and loved life.

                          [Illustration: No. 5
                          SCHUMANN AS A YOUTH.]

What do you think the Father and Mother of Robert Schumann wanted him to
be when he was grown up?

A lawyer!

Robert was the youngest of five children, full of fun and up to all
kinds of games. He went to school and became especially fond of reading
plays.

He also loved to write little plays and to act them out on the stage
that his Father had built for him in his room. So he and his companions
could give their plays in their own theatre.

All the while Robert was taking piano lessons.

Just before he entered the High School he heard a pianist who played so
beautifully that he made up his mind that he would become a musician.

The pianist whose playing gave him this thought is one whose name you
will know better and better as you get older.

                          [Illustration: No. 6
                           IGNACE MOSCHELES.]

There was lots of music making in the Schumann home, for Robert and all
his companions played and sang. And besides that, he composed music for
them.

It must have been a pleasant picture to see all these German boys coming
together to make music. If we could gather together some American boys
who were alive at that same time, here are some we could have found:

Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote for children, _Tanglewood Tales_ and the
_Wonder Book_.

                          [Illustration: No. 7
                              HAWTHORNE.]

Then there was Longfellow, who was born in Portland, Maine. How many of
his poems do you know besides _Hiawatha_?

                          [Illustration: No. 8
                              LONGFELLOW.]

And then we must not forget Whittier, who wrote many lovely poems. One
was about a little girl who spelled the word that her companion missed
in school and so she went above him in the class.

                          [Illustration: No. 9
                               WHITTIER.]

And still there was another little boy only a year older than Robert
Schumann. He was born in a cabin.

                         [Illustration: No. 10
                         LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE.]

This boy's name, as you can guess, was Abraham Lincoln.

                         [Illustration: No. 11
                           ABRAHAM LINCOLN.]

So when you think of Robert Schumann, let us also think of Hawthorne,
Longfellow, Whittier, and Lincoln.

They were all doing their best, even as boys, to be useful.

Well, after all, Robert Schumann did not become a lawyer. He studied
music very hard. His teacher was Frederick Wieck. His teacher's
daughter, Clara Wieck, played the piano very beautifully.

                         [Illustration: No. 12
                             CLARA WIECK.]

Papa Wieck, as he was called, was not very kind to Robert Schumann when
the young man confessed that he and Clara loved one another and wished
to marry.

                         [Illustration: No. 13
                           FRIEDRICH WIECK.]

But after a while it all turned out happily and they were married. So
Clara Wieck became Clara Schumann.

Here is a picture of them seated together.

                         [Illustration: No. 14
                      ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN.]

In the sixteen years that Robert Schumann lived after he and Clara Wieck
were married he composed lots of music for the piano, besides songs,
symphonies, and other kinds of compositions.

He was a teacher in the Leipzig Conservatory. Among his friends were
Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, and many others.

Schumann is best known as a composer of music, although he was also a
teacher, a conductor, and a writer upon musical subjects. For many years
he was the head of a musical newspaper, which is remembered to this day
because of the great work he did in helping people to understand new
music and find out new composers. When he was a very young man Schumann
wanted to become a pianist, but he unfortunately used a machine that he
thought was going to help him play better. It hurt his hand so that he
was never able to play well again. Poor Schumann went out of his mind in
his last years, and died insane, July 29, 1856.

                         [Illustration: No. 15
                            CLARA SCHUMANN.]

Clara Schumann lived forty years after Robert Schumann died. She was the
teacher of many students, some of whom traveled from America to study
with her. She, too, was a composer and a concert pianist who played in
public from the time she was ten years of age.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
