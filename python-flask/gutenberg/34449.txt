         A New Extinct Emydid Turtle from the Lower Pliocene
                             of Oklahoma

In the summer of 1946 a party from the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History visited exposures of the Laverne formation in Beaver
County, Oklahoma, at the invitation of Dr. Stuart Schoff of the United
States Geological Survey. When examining the marl beds an Emydid turtle
was discovered which appears to be an unnamed species of the genus
_Chrysemys_. A description of the new species follows.


                   Chrysemys limnodytes, new species

  _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No.
  7676, vertebrate paleontological collection, a turtle consisting of
  a fragmental anterior portion of a carapace, left part of the
  plastron, and several marginals collected by the 1946
  paleontological field party of the University of Kansas Museum of
  Natural History.

  _Geological Age and locality._--Marl beds of the Laverne formation,
  early Pliocene age, in SW 1/4 Sec. 15, T. 4 N., R. 25 ECM, Beaver
  County, Oklahoma. The specimen was removed from the marl
  immediately below the fossil leaf zone (see Chaney and Elias, 1936;
  Frye and Hibbard, 1940).

  _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements) and differing from
  other species of _Chrysemys_ in having: The anterior end of the
  carapace broadly concave, the posterolateral marginals not greatly
  flared, the posterior end of the plastron broadly indented, the
  carapace more sculptured and relatively wider.

_Description of type._--The specimen had been badly damaged before
preservation, and had suffered further damage from exposure before
discovery. The anterior and posterior lobes of the plastron had been
folded over the bridge, forming a three-ply thickness of bone. Of the
carapace, only the following parts are known: Fragment of the nuchal;
right 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals, left 1st, 2d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and
11th marginals; costals 1-5 on the right side; costals 1-4 on the left
side; and 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th neurals. The left half of the plastron is
relatively complete, lacking only the epiplastron and entoplastron. The
left 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are joined to the plastron at the
inguinal buttress, and the right 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are
attached to the fifth costal. The carapace has smooth contours with no
keel present, but on the lower half of the costals there are seven or
eight ridges, and the remaining surface of the costals and neurals are
rugose. The marginals lack ridges, and the posterolateral marginals are
not serrated. The anterior end of the carapace has a broad shallow
notch. The first neural is rounded, and the 2d, 3d, and 4th are
hexagonal, with the broad ends forward. Anterior margins of the 2d and
3d neurals are concave, and the anterior margin of the 4th neural is
straight.

The sulci bounding the scutes are moderately impressed. The width of the
first vertebral scute, anteriorly and posteriorly, is less than the
width of the second vertebral scute. The costal scutes join the marginal
scutes on the marginal plates.

The plastron, broadly indented at the posterior end, does not have the
posterior lobe flared laterally as it is in Recent species of
_Chrysemys_, and lacks any pronounced notch at the femoro-anal suture.
The humero-pectoral sulcus crosses the plastron behind the entoplastron
in a straight line, and reaches the border anterior to the axillary
notch. The pectoro-abdominal suture is anteriorly convex at the sides
and concave at the midline.

A comparison of this carapace and plastron with a series of specimens of
Recent _Chrysemys picta_ and _Pseudemys scripta_ of approximately the
same size reveals characters indicated in the following chart:

Hay attached considerable taxonomic importance to the characters of the
nuchal and I find its characters to be fairly constant in the specimens
of Emydidae examined. Although the nuchal of _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is
incomplete, it can be distinguished from the nuchals described by Hay as
types of his several fossil Emydids. Differences in the nuchal, together
with those in the carapace and plastron, serve to distinguish the
species from other genera of the Emydidae.

When the specimen is compared with _Chrysemys timida_ Hay, of the
Nebraska Pleistocene, many similarities, mostly of generic rank, are
seen. _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is broader in relation to length than is
either _C. timida_ or any Recent specimen examined of the same size. The
greatest allowance possible in estimating the length of _C. limnodytes_
fails to bring the ratio of its breadth to length within the range of
Recent specimens of similar size. Data from 96 specimens of Recent
_Chrysemys picta_ show that the ratio of length to width is not affected
by sex, but that the ratio does vary with the age of the specimen. In
young animals the length and width are approximately equal, but with
further growth the length becomes relatively greater. Specimens in the
length group of 135 to 144 mm. have the widths ranging from 71 to 81 per
cent of the lengths. In all specimens larger than this, the ratio is in
the low seventies, and the largest specimen, 177 mm. in length, has the
width of the carapace amounting to only 74 per cent of the length. The
fossil species, _C. timida_, with a length of 160 mm., has the width
amounting to 75 per cent of the length, and _C. limnodytes_, with an
estimated length of 180 mm., has the width amounting to 80.5 per cent of
the length. _C. timida_ is widest anteriorly, whereas _C. limnodytes_
and the other species of the genus are widest posteriorly. Less obvious
differences between the two fossils are the narrower anterior margin of
the nuchal, the concave anterior end of the carapace, the sculptured
surface of the carapace, and the relatively wider neurals and longer
vertebrals of _C. limnodytes_.

_Remarks._--Noteworthy is the intermediate nature of _C. limnodytes_
when compared with species of the genera _Chrysemys_ and _Pseudemys_.
However, any resemblance to _Pseudemys_ is not to be considered as
evidence that _C. limnodytes_ is in any way ancestral to the genus
_Pseudemys_. The fossil specimens of _Pseudemys_ from the Pliocene are
too poorly known to allow the student certainly to place them in their
correct systematic positions. The fossil Emydids from Western Europe,
listed as species of _Chrysemys_, differ very much from this species, or
belong to other genera of the family.

Only a few turtles are known from the Laverne formation. Hesse (Chaney
and Elias, 1936) reported a small _Testudo_ from the Laverne of Beaver
County, Oklahoma, but neglected to state whether it was among the
material borrowed by him from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural
History. The Museum has an incomplete carapace and plastron (No. 3101)
of a small _Testudo_ from that locality and formation. In Harper County,
Oklahoma, the field party from the University recovered a large number
of fragments of a large _Testudo_. Although this specimen is as yet
unprepared, enough fragments have been pieced together to reveal that
the tibia is 127 mm. long. This dimension and those of some of the
fragments indicate that the animal may have been four to five feet long.

Mrs. Bernita Mansfield of the Geology Department, University of Kansas,
prepared the plate.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
