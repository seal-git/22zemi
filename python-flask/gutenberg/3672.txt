AFGHANISTAN

@Afghanistan:Introduction

Background: Afghanistan was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union
in 1979. The USSR was forced to withdraw 10 years later by
anti-communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the US, Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued among
the various mujahidin factions, but the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban
movement has been able to seize most of the country. In addition to
the continuing civil strife, the country suffers from enormous
poverty, a crumbling infrastructure, and widespread live mines.

@Afghanistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989).
During that conflict one-third of the population fled the country,
with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6
million refugees. In early 1999, 1.2 million Afghan refugees remained
in Pakistan and about 1.4 million in Iran. Gross domestic product has
fallen substantially over the past 20 years because of the loss of
labor and capital and the disruption of trade and transport. The
majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food,
clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation remains a serious
problem throughout the country. International aid can deal with only a
fraction of the humanitarian problem, let alone promote economic
development. The economic situation did not improve in 1998-99, as
internal civil strife continued, hampering both domestic economic
policies and international aid efforts. Numerical data are likely to
be either unavailable or unreliable. Afghanistan was by far the
largest producer of opium poppies in 1999, and narcotics trafficking
is a major source of revenue.

@Albania:Economy

Economy - overview: An extremely poor country by European standards,
Albania is making the difficult transition to a more open-market
economy. The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression
accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in
1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain
stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to
renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997
- which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's
population - triggered severe social unrest which led to more than
1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an 8% drop in
GDP. The new government, installed in July 1997, has taken strong
measures to restore public order and to revive economic activity and
trade. The economy continues to be bolstered by remittances of some
20% of the labor force that works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy.
These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign
trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992,
substantially improving peasant incomes. In 1998, Albania recovered
the 8% drop in GDP of 1997 and pushed ahead by 7% in 1999.
International aid has helped defray the high costs of receiving and
returning refugees from the Kosovo conflict.

ALGERIA

@Algeria:Introduction

Background: After a century of rule by France, Algeria became
independent in 1962. The surprising first round success of the
fundamentalist FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) party in December 1991
balloting caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and
postpone the subsequent elections. The FIS response has resulted in a
continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state apparatus,
which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring pro-government and
moderate religious-based parties. FIS's armed wing, the Islamic
Salvation Army, dissolved itself in January 2000 and many armed
insurgents surrendered under an amnesty program designed to promote
national reconciliation. Nevertheless, some residual fighting
continues. Other concerns include large-scale unemployment and the
need to diversify the petroleum-based economy.

@Algeria:Economy

Economy - overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of GDP,
and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
stalled in 1992 as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.
Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year
signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended 30 April
1998. Some progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings
in 1995 and 1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a
recovery in growth since 1995. Still, the economy remains heavily
dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has
continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and
domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little
success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.

AMERICAN SAMOA

@American Samoa:Introduction

Background: Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was "discovered" by
European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the
latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in
which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US
formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands
with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

@American Samoa:Economy

Economy - overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the
great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the
primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to
develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote
location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.
Tourism, a developing sector, may be held back by the current
financial difficulties in East Asia.

well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9
million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free
status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France
and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods
and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status,
also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production
is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU
member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU
member for agricultural products.

ANGOLA

@Angola:Introduction

Background: Civil war has been the norm in Angola since independence
from Portugal in 1975. A 1994 peace accord between the government and
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the
government and armed forces. A national unity government was installed
in April of 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering
hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may
have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century.

@Angola:Economy

Economy - overview: Angola is an economy in disarray because of a
quarter century of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant
natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the
population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to
the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.
Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994,
violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers
are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
resources - gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, and
large oil deposits - Angola will need to implement the peace agreement
and reform government policies. Despite the increase in the pace of
civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in
1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999,
including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens
prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside
of the petroleum sector.

ANGUILLA

@Anguilla:Introduction

Background: Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th
century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was
incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts
and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years
after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this
arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a
separate British dependency.

@Anguilla:Economy

Economy - overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the
economy depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster
fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects
of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996. Increased
activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the growth of the
construction sector, contributed to economic growth in 1997-98.
Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing the
offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial
services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term,
prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and,
therefore, on continuing income growth in the industrialized nations
as well as favorable weather conditions.

ANTARCTICA

@Antarctica:Geography

Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references: Antarctic Region

Area:
total: 14 million sq km
land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
ice-covered) (est.)
note: fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North America,
and South America, but larger than Australia and the subcontinent of
Europe

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries: 0 km
note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline: 17,968 km

Maritime claims: none, but see the Disputes - international entry

Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
the coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
ranges up to 5,140 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of
southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and
parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along
about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11%
of the area of the continent

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Southern Ocean 0 m
highest point: Vinson Massif 5,140 m

Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

Land use:
arable land: 0%
permanent crops: 0%
permanent pastures: 0%
forests and woodland: 0%
other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

Irrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)

Natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along
the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak

Environment - current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed that
the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of icefish,
an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was
shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants

Geography - note: the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and
driest continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the
surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable

@Antarctica:People

Population: no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally
staffed research stations

the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the population of persons
doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands
south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered by the
Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000

Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic Treaty,
signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,
establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
Administration is carried out through consultative member meetings -
the 23rd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Peru in May
1999. At the end of 1999, there were 44 treaty member nations: 27
consultative and 17 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include
the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national
territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant nations. The US and
some other nations that have made no claims have reserved the right to
do so. The US does not recognize the claims of others. The year in
parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted to full
consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country was
an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina,
Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant
consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), Bulgaria (1998)
China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India
(1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990),
Peru (1989), Poland (1977), Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden
(1988), Uruguay (1985), and the US. Acceding (nonvoting) members, with
year of accession in parentheses, are - Austria (1987), Canada (1988),
Colombia (1988), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),
Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987),
Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland
(1990), Turkey (1995), Ukraine (1992), and Venezuela (1999). Article 1
- area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such
as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and
equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful
purpose; Article 2 - freedom of scientific investigation and
cooperation shall continue; Article 3 - free exchange of information
and personnel in cooperation with the UN and other international
agencies; Article 4 - does not recognize, dispute, or establish
territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the
treaty is in force; Article 5 - prohibits nuclear explosions or
disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6 - includes under the treaty
all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south; Article
7 - treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8 - allows
for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
Article 9 - frequent consultative meetings take place among member
nations; Article 10 - treaty states will discourage activities by any
country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; Article 11 -
disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or,
ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14 - deal with upholding,
interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations. Other
agreements - some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative
meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources
agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently rejected; the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this
agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora,
environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected
areas; it prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources
except scientific research.

Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: the
taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

@Antarctica:Economy

Economy - overview: No economic activity is conducted at present,
except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based
abroad. Antarctic fisheries in 1998-99 (1 July-30 June) reported
landing 119,898 metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six
times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing
in antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and
Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. A total of 10,013 tourists
visited in the 1998-99 summer, up from the 9,604 who visited the
previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 16 commercial
(nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that made 116 trips during
the summer. Most tourist trips lasted approximately two weeks.

@Antigua and Barbuda:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism continues to be the dominant activity in
the economy accounting directly or indirectly for more than half of
GDP. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt
by financial sanctions imposed by the US and UK as a result of the
loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made
efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the
sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is
mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by
the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of
higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises
enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding,
handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth
in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the
industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about
one-third of all tourist arrivals.

GDP: purchasing power parity - $524 million (1999 est.)

ARCTIC OCEAN

@Arctic Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Arctic
Ocean remains the smallest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Southern Ocean).

@Arctic Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 N, 0 00 E

Map references: Arctic Region

Area:
total: 14.056 million sq km
note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 45,389 km

Climate: polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak
cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack
that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges
may be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New Siberian
Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin
interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen
Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Fram Basin -4,665 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
and whales)

Natural hazards: ice islands occasionally break away from northern
Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland
and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually ice
locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing
from October to May

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include
walruses and whales; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to
recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack

Geography - note: major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea
(northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait);
strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine
link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating
research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in
March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow
cover lasts about 10 months

@Arctic Ocean:Government

Data code: none; the US Government has not approved a standard for
hydrographic codes - see the Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data
Codes appendix

@Arctic Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic activity is limited to the exploitation
of natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and
seals.

@Arctic Ocean:Transportation

Ports and harbors: Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay
(US)

Transportation - note: sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land
routes; the Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route
(Eurasia) are important seasonal waterways

@Arctic Ocean:Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: some maritime disputes (see littoral
states); Svalbard is the focus of a maritime boundary dispute between
Norway and Russia

@Argentina:Economy

Economy - overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a
highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. However, when President Carlos
MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge external
debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was
plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked on
a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. In
1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the peso to
the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by law to
the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent years. In
1995, the Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the loss of
banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived, recession; a
series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking system followed.
Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching 8% in 1997. In 1998,
international financial turmoil caused by Russia's problems and
increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced the highest domestic
interest rates in more than three years, halving the growth rate of
the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP falling by 3%.
President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in December 1999,
sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, which
had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. The new government also arranged
a new $7.4 billion stand-by facility with the IMF for contingency
purposes - almost three times the size of the previous arrangement.
Key challenges facing the new government include reforming the
country's rigid labor code and addressing the precarious financial
situation of several highly indebted provinces.

ARMENIA

@Armenia:Introduction

Background: An Orthodox Christian country, Armenia was incorporated
into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated exclave, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began
fighting over the exclave in 1988; the struggle escalated after both
countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May
1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not only
Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper.
The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make
substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.

@Armenia:Economy

Economy - overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR
in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away
from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and
updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower
pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current
administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits
(gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over
the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the
breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet
Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By
1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth
rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to
privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy
shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by
the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector
especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic
restructuring, and foreign direct investment.

@Aruba:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has
further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than 1%
unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job
vacancies, despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

ATLANTIC OCEAN

@Atlantic Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Atlantic
Ocean remains the second-largest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and
Arctic Ocean).

@Atlantic Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, Europe, the Southern Ocean,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 25 00 W

Map references: World

Area:
total: 76.762 million sq km
note: includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait,
Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico,
Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia
Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 111,866 km

Climate: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of
Africa near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea;
hurricanes can occur from May to December, but are most frequent from
August to November

Terrain: surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark
Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm-water gyre
(broad, circular system of currents) in the northern Atlantic,
counterclockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic; the ocean
floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south
centerline for the entire Atlantic basin

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench -8,605 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and
whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic
nodules, precious stones

Natural hazards: icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and
the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been
spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; ships subject
to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from October to
May; persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September;
hurricanes (May to December)

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales; drift net fishing is
hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international
disputes; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil,
and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico,
Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and
municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean
Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include the Dardanelles, Strait of
Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits
include the Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The
Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; the Equator divides the
Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean

AUSTRALIA

@Australia:Introduction

Background: Australia became a commonwealth of the British Empire in
1901. It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to
rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to
make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and
II. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of
the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas,
especially the Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's
status, from a commonwealth headed by the British monarch to an
independent republic, was defeated in 1999.

@Australia:Economy

Economy - overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style
capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the four
dominant West European economies. Rich in natural resources, Australia
is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and
fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value of total
exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a big
impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased exports
of manufactured goods, but competition in international markets
continues to be severe. While Australia has suffered from the low
growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
early 1990s and during the recent financial problems in East Asia, the
economy has expanded at a solid 4% annual growth pace in the last five
years. Canberra's emphasis on reforms is a key factor behind the
economy's resilience to the regional crisis and its stronger than
expected growth rate. Growth in 2000 will depend on key international
commodity prices, the extent of recovery in nearby Asian economies,
and the strength of US and European markets.

AUSTRIA

@Austria:Introduction

Background: Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and
subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies, Austria's 1955 State
Treaty declared the country "permanently neutral" as a condition of
Soviet military withdrawal. Neutrality, once ingrained as part of the
Austrian cultural identity, has been called into question since the
Soviet collapse and Austria's increasingly prominent role in European
affairs. A prosperous country, Austria joined the European Union in
1995 and the euro monetary system in 1999.

@Austria:Economy

Economy - overview: Austria with its well-developed market economy and
high standard of living is closely tied to other EU economies,
especially Germany's. Membership in the EU has drawn an influx of
foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European
market. Through privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget
consolidation programs, and austerity measures, Austria has brought
its total public sector deficit down to 2.1% of GDP in 1999 and public
debt - at 63.1% of GDP in 1998 - more or less in line with the 60% of
GDP required by the EMU's Maastricht criteria. Cuts mainly have
affected the civil service and Austria's generous social benefit
system, the two major causes of the government's deficit. To meet
increased competition from both EU and Central European countries,
Austria will need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy
and deregulate the service sector. Growth, which slowed to 2.0% in
1999, probably will rebound to 2.8% in both 2000 and 2001.

AZERBAIJAN

@Azerbaijan:Introduction

Background: Azerbaijan - a nation of Turkic Muslims - has been an
independent republic since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Despite a cease-fire, in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to
resolve its conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave (largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has
lost almost 20% of its territory and must support some 750,000
refugees as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous and the
promise of wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum resources
remains largely unfulfilled.

@Azerbaijan:Economy

Economy - overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
either Armenia or Georgia, the other Caucasian states. It resembles
the Central Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high
structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
most prominent products are oil, cotton, and natural gas. Production
from the Caspian oil field declined through 1997 but registered an
increase in 1998-99. Negotiation of 19 production-sharing arrangements
(PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion
to oil field development, should generate the funds needed to spur
future industrial development. Oil production under the first of these
PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in
November 1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the
former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a
market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on
economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being
replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up
foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet
republics is declining in importance while trade is building up with
Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the nations of Europe. Growth in 2000 should
match growth in 1999. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil
prices and the location of new pipelines in the region.

serviceable; satellite service between Baku and Turkey provides access
to 200 countries; additional satellite providers supply services
between Baku and specific countries; Azerbaijan is a signator of the
Trans-Asia-Europe Fiber-Optic Line (TAE); their lines are not laid but
a Turkish satellite and a microwave link between Azerbaijan and Iran
could provide Azerbaijan worldwide access

BAHRAIN

@Bahrain:Introduction

Background: Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian
Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign
affairs among its larger neighbors. Possessing minimal oil reserves,
Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining, and has
transformed itself into an international banking center. The new amir
is pushing economic and political reforms, and has worked to improve
relations with the Shi'a community.

@Bahrain:Economy

Economy - overview: In Bahrain, petroleum production and processing
account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues,
and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing
fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf
crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and
transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms
with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of
petroleum products made from imported crude. Construction proceeds on
several major industrial projects. Unemployment, especially among the
young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources
are major long-term economic problems.

@Bangladesh:Economy

Economy - overview: Despite sustained domestic and international
efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh
remains one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least
developed nations. The economy is largely agricultural, with the
cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
resources (natural gas), inadequate power supplies, and slow
implementation of economic reforms. Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA
Wajed's Awami League government has made some headway improving the
climate for foreign investors and liberalizing the capital markets;
for example, it has negotiated with foreign firms for oil and gas
exploration, better countrywide distribution of cooking gas, and the
construction of natural gas pipelines and power plants. Progress on
other economic reforms has been halting because of opposition from the
bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups.
The especially severe floods of 1998 increased the country's reliance
on large-scale international aid. So far the East Asian financial
crisis has not had major impact on the economy.

Economy - overview: Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but
production in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and
tourism. The start of the Port Charles Marina project in Speightstown
helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996-99. Offshore
finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and
there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues
its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate,
encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining
state-owned enterprises.

Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer
political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former
Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state
union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic
integration but, to date, neither side has actively sought to
implement the accord.

@Belarus:Economy

Economy - overview: Belarus has seen little structural reform since
1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
"market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO re-imposed
administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
enterprise. In addition to the burdens imposed by high inflation,
businesses have been subject to pressure on the part of central and
local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous
rigorous inspections, and retroactive application of new business
regulations prohibiting practices that had been legal. Further
economic problems are two consecutive bad harvests, 1998-99, and
persistent trade deficits. Close relations with Russia, possibly
leading to reunion, color the pattern of economic developments. For
the time being, Belarus remains self-isolated from the West and its
open-market economies.

@Belgium:Economy

Economy - overview: This modern private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed
transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north, although the government is encouraging investment in the
southern region of Wallonia. With few natural resources, Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large
volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the
state of world markets. About three-quarters of its trade is with
other EU countries. Belgium's public debt fell from 127% of GDP in
1996 to 122% of GDP in 1998 and the government is trying to control
its expenditures to bring the figure more into line with other
industrialized countries. Belgium became a charter member of the
European Monetary Union (EMU) in January 1999. The dioxin crisis -
beginning in June 1999 with the discovery of a cancer-causing
substance in animal feed - constituted a serious blow to the
food-processing industry, both domestically and internationally. This
crisis slowed down GDP growth with recovery expected in the year 2000.

@Belize:Economy

Economy - overview: The small, essentially private enterprise economy
is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of
exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest employer.
The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted in an
economic slowdown that continued in 1998. The trade deficit has been
growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar and
bananas. The new government faces important challenges to economic
stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised,
but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange
rate under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened
in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at
4%.

@Benin:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1990-95 and 5%
in 1996-99. Rapid population growth has offset much of this growth in
output. Inflation has subsided over the past three years. Commercial
and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt
situation in recent years. The government, still burdened with
money-losing state enterprises and a bloated civil service, has been
gradually implementing a structural adjustment program since 1991.

@Bermuda:Economy

Economy - overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
incomes in the world, having successfully exploited its location by
providing financial services for international firms and luxury
tourist facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist
industry, which accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84% of
its business from North America. The industrial sector is small, and
agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80%
of food needs are imported. International business contributes over
60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed independence vote in late
1995 can be partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away
foreign firms. Government economic priorities are the further
strengthening of the tourist and international financial sectors.

@Bhutan:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and least
developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the
main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about 40% of
GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal
husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building
of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy
is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary
links. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most
production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key
resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.
Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed
controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing,
trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

BOLIVIA

@Bolivia:Introduction

Background: Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history
has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and counter-coups.
Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s,
but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty,
social unrest, and drug production. Current goals include attracting
foreign investment, strengthening the educational system, continuing
the privatization program, and waging an anti-corruption campaign.

@Bolivia:Economy

Economy - overview: Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries, has made considerable progress
toward the development of a market-oriented economy. Successes under
President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) included the signing of a free
trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,
telephone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil company.
His successor, Hugo BANZER Suarez has tried to further improve the
country's investment climate with an anticorruption campaign. Growth
slowed in 1999, in part due to tight government budget policies, which
limited needed appropriations for anti-poverty programs, and the
fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Growth should rebound to
perhaps 4% in 2000 given reasonably favorable world commodity prices.

and Colombia) with an estimated 21,800 hectares under cultivation in
1999, a 45% decrease in overall cultivation of coca from 1998 levels;
intermediate coca products and cocaine exported to or through
Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile to the US and other
international drug markets; alternative crop program aims to reduce
illicit coca cultivation

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Introduction

Background: Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in
October of 1991, was followed by a referendum for independence from
the former Yugoslavia in February of 1992. The Bosnian Serbs -
supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance
aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining
Serb-held areas to form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's
Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three
to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton,
Ohio, the warring parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a
halt the three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement
was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement divides
Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska. In
1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000
troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects
of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed
hostilities. SFOR remains in place, with troop levels to be reduced to
about 19,000 by spring 2000.

Government - note: The Dayton Agreement, signed in Paris on 14
December 1995, retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint
multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government -
based on proportional representation similar to that which existed in
the former socialist regime - is charged with conducting foreign,
economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized a
second tier of government, comprised of two entities - a joint
Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian
Serb Republika Srpska (RS) - each presiding over roughly one-half the
territory. The Federation and RS governments are charged with
overseeing internal functions. The Dayton Agreement established the
Office of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the implementation
of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and
450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Economy

Economy - overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been
greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the socialist economic
structure of Yugoslavia. TITO had pushed the development of military
industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic warfare
in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995,
unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an uneasy
peace in place, output recovered in 1996-98 at high percentage rates
on a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999, and GDP
remains far below the 1990 level. Economic data are of limited use
because, although both entities issue figures, national-level
statistics are not available. Moreover, official data do not capture
the large share of activity that occurs on the black market. In 1999,
the convertible mark - the national currency introduced in 1998 -
gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina dramatically increased its reserve holdings.
Implementation of privatization, however, faltered in both areas.
Banking reform is also lagging. The country receives substantial
amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the
international community but will have to prepare for an era of
declining assistance.

@Botswana:Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture still provides a livelihood for more
than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs
and accounts for only 3% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle
raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and
poor soils. Diamond mining and tourism also are important to the
economy. Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the
mining sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 38% in 1998.
Unemployment officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it
closer to 40%. The Orapa 2000 project, which will double the capacity
of the country's main diamond mine, will be finished in early 2000.
This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion.

BRAZIL

@Brazil:Introduction

Background: Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal,
Brazil became an independent nation in 1822. By far the largest and
most populous country in South America, Brazil has overcome more than
half a century of military intervention in the governance of the
country to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development
of the interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor
pool, Brazil became Latin America's leading economic power by the
1970s. Highly unequal income distribution remains a pressing problem.

@Brazil:Economy

Economy - overview: Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its
presence in world markets. In the late eighties and early nineties,
high inflation hindered economic activity and investment. The Real
Plan, instituted in the spring of 1994, sought to break inflationary
expectations by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was
brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to
avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the
transition phase of the Real Plan. This appreciation meant that
Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other
countries, which contributed to large current account deficits.
However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the
financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as
inflation rates stabilized and the debt crisis of the eighties faded
from memory. The maintenance of large current account deficits via
capital account surpluses became problematic as investors became more
risk averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian
financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998.
After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on
structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led
international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the
Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be
pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn
in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about
over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt to GDP ratio of 48% for 1999
beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will
maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating
currency. The economy is expected to push growth up to 3% in 2000.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the
Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an
estimated 45% of the national income. An estimated 350,000 tourists,
mainly from the US, visited the islands in 1997. In the mid-1980s, the
government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing
to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate
substantial revenues. An estimated 250,000 companies were on the
offshore registry by yearend 1997. The adoption of a comprehensive
insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of
confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of
criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands even
more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is the
most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands'
ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally
close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has
used the dollar as its currency since 1959.

@Brunei:Economy

Economy - overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and
welfare measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally
supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from
the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP
is far above most other Third World countries, and substantial income
from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production.
The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food
and housing. The government has shown progress in its basic policy of
diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy
will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to
become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000
APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 is
estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.

Background: Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars,
Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a
People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1991 with the
dissolution of the USSR, and Bulgaria began the contentious process of
moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating
inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. Today, reforms and
democratization keep Bulgaria on a path toward eventual integration
into the EU and NATO.

@Bulgaria:Economy

Economy - overview: In April 1997, the current ruling Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) government won pre-term parliamentary
elections and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded
in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and
1997 has given way to an official consumer price increase of 6.2% in
1999. Following declines in GDP in both 1996 and 1997, the economy
grew an officially estimated 3.5% in 1998 and 2.5% in 1999. In
September 1998, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility,
which provides credits worth approximately $900 million, designed to
support Bulgaria's reform efforts. In 1999, an unfavorable
international environment - primarily caused by the Kosovo conflict -
and structural reforms slowed economic growth, but forecasters are
predicting accelerated growth over the next several years. The
government's structural reform program includes: (a) privatization
and, where appropriate, liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs);
(b) liberalization of agricultural policies, including creating
conditions for the development of a land market; (c) reform of the
country's social insurance programs; and (d) reforms to strengthen
contract enforcement and fight crime and corruption.

Economy - overview: One of the poorest countries in the world,
landlocked Burkina Faso has a high population density, few natural
resources, and a fragile soil. About 90% of the population is engaged
in (mainly subsistence) agriculture which is highly vulnerable to
variations in rainfall. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable
government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc
currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its
development program in conjunction with international agencies, and
exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its
macroeconomic progress in 2000-2001 depends on continued low
inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to
encourage private investment.

@Burma:Economy

Economy - overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the last 11 years,
1989-99, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three decades of
tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased;
foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success.
State enterprises remain highly inefficient and privatization efforts
have stalled. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly
understated because of the volume of black-market trade. A major
ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability. Burma remains a poor Asian country and living standards for
the majority have not improved over the past decade. The short-term
outlook is for continued sluggish growth because of poor government
planning, internal unrest, minimal foreign investment, and the large
trade deficit.

38% due to drought; cultivation in 1999 - 89,500 hectares, a 31%
decline from 1998); surrender of drug warlord KHUN SA's Mong Tai Army
in January 1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major counternarcotics
success, but lack of government will and ability to take on major
narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money
laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; becoming a
major source of methamphetamines for regional consumption

BURUNDI

@Burundi:Introduction

Background: Between 1993 and 1999, ethnic violence between Hutu and
Tutsi factions in Burundi created hundreds of thousands of refugees
and left at least 250,000 dead. Although many refugees have returned
from neighboring countries, continued ethnic strife has forced others
to flee. Burundian troops, seeking to secure their borders, have
intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

@Burundi:Economy

Economy - overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country
with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is
predominantely agricultural with roughly 90% of the population
dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on
the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings.
The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries
of the climate and the international coffee market. Since October 1993
the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has
resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 persons and the displacement
of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in
short supply.

@Cambodia:Introduction

Background: Following a five-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge
forces captured Phnom Penh in 1975 and ordered the evacuation of all
cities and towns; over 1 million displaced people died from execution
or enforced hardships. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer
Rouge into the countryside and touched off 13 years of fighting.
UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of
normalcy, as did the rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the
mid-1990s. A coalition government, formed after national elections in
1998, brought renewed political stability and the surrender of
remaining Khmer Rouge forces.

@Cambodia:Economy

Economy - overview: After four years of solid macroeconomic
performance, Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98 due to
the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political
infighting. Foreign investment and tourism fell off. Also, in 1998 the
main harvest was hit by drought. But in 1999, the first full year of
peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and growth
resumed at 4%. The long-term development of the economy after decades
of war remains a daunting challenge. The population lacks education
and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside,
which suffers from an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.
Recurring political instability and corruption within government
discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid. On the brighter
side, the government is addressing these issues with assistance from
bilateral and multilateral donors. So long as political stability
lasts, the Cambodian economy is likely to grow at a respectable pace.

@Cameroon:Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a
top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on
various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business
investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and
recapitalize the nation's banks. The government, however, has failed
to press forward vigorously with these programs. The latest enhanced
structural adjustment agreement was signed in October 1997; the
parties hope this will prove more successful, yet government
mismanagement and corruption remain problems. Inflation has been
brought back under control. Progress toward privatization of remaining
state industry should support continued economic growth in 2000.

unfortified border. Its paramount political problem continues to be
the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its French-speaking
residents and unique culture, to the remainder of the country.

@Canada:Economy

Economy - overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World
War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and
service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Real rates of growth
have averaged nearly 3.0% since 1993. Unemployment is falling and
government budget surpluses are being partially devoted to reducing
the large public sector debt. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which
included Mexico) have touched off a dramatic increase in trade and
economic integration with the US. With its great natural resources,
skilled labor force, and modern capital plant Canada enjoys solid
economic prospects. Two shadows loom, the first being the continuing
constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking areas,
which has been raising the possibility of a split in the federation.
Another long-term concern is the flow south to the US of professional
persons lured by higher pay, lower taxes, and the immense high-tech
infrastructure.

@Cape Verde:Economy

Economy - overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, including serious water shortages exacerbated
by cycles of long-term drought. The economy is service-oriented, with
commerce, transport, and public services accounting for almost 70% of
GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the
share of agriculture in GDP in 1998 was only 13%, of which fishing
accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by foreign aid and
remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute a supplement to GDP
of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic
government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and
attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for
2000 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and
the momentum of the government's development program.

@Central African Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted
for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled
work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The
50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,
timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions
and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction
of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living
conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses
in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government. The IMF
approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998. The
government has set targets of annual 5% growth and 2.5% inflation for
2000-2001.

CHAD

@Chad:Introduction

Background: Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960,
endured three decades of ethnic warfare as well as invasions by Libya
before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. A
transitional government eventually suppressed or came to terms with
most political-military groups, settled a territorial dispute with
Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a democratic constitution,
and held multiparty presidential and National Assembly elections in
1996 and 1997 respectively. In 1998 a new rebellion broke out in
northern Chad, which continued to escalate throughout 1999. Despite
movement toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a
northern ethnic oligarchy.

@Chad:Economy

Economy - overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers
from it's geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and
political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on agriculture,
including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's Francophone countries,
Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in
January 1994. Financial aid from the World Bank, the African
Development Fund, and other sources is directed largely at the
improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production. Due to
lack of financing, the development of the Doba Basin oil fields,
originally due to finish in 2000, has been substantially delayed.

@Chile:Introduction

Background: A three-year-old Marxist government was overthrown in 1973
by a dictatorial military regime led by Augusto PINOCHET, which ruled
until a freely elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic
policies, first implemented by the PINOCHET dictatorship, led to
unprecedented growth in 1991-97 and have helped secure the country's
commitment to democratic and representative government. Growth slowed
in 1998-99, but will likely recover in 2000.

@Chile:Economy

Economy - overview: Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized
by a high level of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's
reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when
the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from
the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the
military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during the period
1991-1997, but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight
monetary policies implemented to keep the current account deficit in
check and lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in 1999,
reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic growth for the
first time in more than 15 years. Despite the effects of the
recession, Chile maintained its reputation for strong financial
institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest
sovereign bond rating in South America. By the end of 1999, exports
and economic activity had begun to recover, and a return to strong
growth in 2000 is likely. The inauguration of Ricardo LAGOS in March
2000, succeeding Eduardo FREI, will keep the presidency in the hands
of the center-left Concertacion coalition that has held office since
the return of civilian rule in 1990.

@China:Introduction

Background: For centuries China has stood as a leading civilization,
outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences. But in the
first half of the 20th century, China was beset by major famines,
civil unrest, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World
War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship
that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over
everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After
1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping decentralized economic decision
making. Output quadrupled in the next 20 years and China now has the
world's second largest GDP. Political controls remain tight even while
economic controls continue to weaken.

@China:Economy

Economy - overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has
been moving the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned
economy to a more market-oriented economy but still within a rigid
political framework of Communist Party control. To this end the
authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in
agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In
1999, with its 1.25 billion people but a GDP of just $3,800 per
capita, China became the second largest economy in the world after the
US. Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also posted
major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic
and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often
experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains
and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. In late 1993 China's
leadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still
more play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the
center's control over the financial system; state enterprises would
continue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed "a
socialist market economy". In 1995-99 inflation dropped sharply,
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control
food prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect
revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce
corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large
state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the
vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which had been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 50 to 100 million
surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities,
many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,
changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to
maintaining growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to
continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the
environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose
arable land because of erosion and economic development. The next few
years will witness increasing tensions between a highly centralized
political system and an increasingly decentralized economic system.

@Christmas Island:Economy

Economy - overview: Phosphate mining had been the only significant
economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian Government
closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened by union workers. With
the support of the government, Australian-based Casinos Austria
International Ltd. built a $34 million casino on Christmas Island,
which opened in 1993. As of yearend 1999, gaming facilities at the
casino were temporarily closed but were expected to reopen in early
2000. Another economic prospect is the possible location of a
space-launching site on the island.

COLOMBIA

@Colombia:Introduction

Background: Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and
Venezuela). A 40-year insurgent campaign to overthrow the Colombian
Government escalated during the 1990s, undergirded in part by funds
from the drug trade. Although the violence is deadly and large swaths
of the countryside are under guerrilla influence, the movement lacks
the military strength or popular support necessary to overthrow the
government. While Bogota continues to try to negotiate a settlement,
neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their
borders.

@Colombia:Economy

Economy - overview: Colombia is poised for moderate growth in the next
several years, marking an end to the severe 1999 recession when GDP
fell by about 5%. President PASTRANA's well-respected economic team is
taking steps to keep the recovery on track, such as lowering interest
rates and shoring up the financial system. In its loan agreement with
the IMF, the administration has pledged to take additional steps to
restore growth, reduce inflation, and improve the public sector's
fiscal health. Many challenges to sustainable growth remain, however.
Unemployment reached a record 20% in 1999 and may remain high,
contributing to the extreme inequality in income distribution.
Colombia's leading exports, oil and coffee, face an uncertain future:
new exploration is needed to offset a pending decline in oil
production, and the coffee harvest has dropped off because of aging
plantations and natural disasters. The lack of public security is a
key concern for investors, making progress in the government's peace
negotiations with insurgent groups an important driver of economic
performance. Colombia is looking for international financial
assistance to boost economic recovery and peace prospects.

Njazidja, Nzwani, and Mayotte (a territorial collectivity of France,
but claimed by Comoros); the design, the most recent of several, is
described in the constitution approved by referendum on 7 June 1992

@Comoros:Economy

Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a
young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a
subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the
economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force,
and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient
in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of
imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and
technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to
promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP
growth is to be met.

@Cook Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations, the
Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic
devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure.
Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of
copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made
up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. Efforts to exploit tourism potential,
encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing
industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment
and growth.

@Costa Rica:Economy

Economy - overview: Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends on
tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social
safety net has been put into place. Economic growth has rebounded from
-0.9% in 1996 to 4% in 1997, 6% in 1998, and 7% in 1999. Inflation
rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, 12% in 1998, and 11%
in 1999. Large government deficits - fueled by interest payments on
the massive internal debt - have undermined efforts to maintain the
quality of social services. Curbing inflation, reducing the deficit,
and improving public sector efficiency remain key challenges to the
government. Political resistance to privatization has stalled
liberalization efforts.

CROATIA

@Croatia:Introduction

Background: In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom
known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia
became an independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal
TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in
1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting
before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands.
Under UN supervision the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia
was returned to Croatia in 1998.

@Croatia:Economy

Economy - overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from:
the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage
during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines,
buildings, and houses; the large refugee and displaced population,
both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties.
Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
industries, would help restore the economy. The government has been
successful in some reform efforts - partially macroeconomic
stabilization policies - and it has normalized relations with its
creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large
state enterprises and with bank reform. The recession that began at
the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999, and GDP growth for the
year was flat. Inflation remained in check and the kuna was stable.
The death of President TUDJMAN in December 1999, and the defeat of his
ruling Coatian Democratic Union or HDZ party in parliamentary and
presidential elections in January 2000 has ushered in a new government
committed to economic reform but faced with the challenge of halting
the economic decline.

@Cuba:Introduction

Background: Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron
will has held the country together since. Cuba's communist revolution,
with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The country is now slowly recovering
from a severe economic recession following the withdrawal of former
Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually, in 1990.
Havana blames its difficulties on the US embargo in place since 1962.

@Cuba:Economy

Economy - overview: The state under the durable dictatorship of Fidel
CASTRO plays the primary role in the domestic economy and controls
practically all foreign trade. The government has undertaken several
reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity, increase labor
incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods,
and services. The liberalized agricultural markets introduced in
October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota
production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to
lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money
supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to
the dollar by yearend 1999. New taxes introduced in 1996 have helped
drive down the number of self-employed workers from 208,000 in January
1996. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during
1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies.
The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7%
growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth
slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. Growth
recovered again in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP, due to the
continued growth of tourism. Central control is complicated by the
existence of the informal economy, much of which is denominated in
dollars. Living standards for the average (dollarless) Cuban remain at
a depressed level compared with 1990. The continuation of gradual
economic reforms and increase in tourism suggest growth of 4% to 5% in
2000.

CYPRUS

@Cyprus:Introduction

Background: Independence from the UK was approved in 1960 with
constitutional guarantees by the Greek Cypriot majority to the Turkish
Cypriot minority. In 1974 a Greek-sponsored attempt to seize the
government was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon
controlled almost 40% of the island. In 1983 the Turkish-held area
declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but it is
recognized only by Turkey. Cyprus talks resumed in December 1999 to
prepare the ground for a comprehensive settlement.

@Cyprus:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic affairs are dominated by the division of
the country into the southern (Greek) area controlled by the Cyprus
Government and the northern Turkish Cypriot-administered area. The
Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly susceptible to external
shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's
vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political
instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in
Western Europe. Economic policy in the south is focused on meeting the
criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish sector, water
shortage is a growing problem, and several desalination plants are
planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has about one-fifth the
population and one-third the per capita GDP of the south. Because it
is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging
foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there.
The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture and government
service, which together employ about half of the work force. Moreover,
the small, vulnerable economy has suffered because the Turkish lira is
legal tender. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey
provides direct and indirect aid to tourism, education, industry, etc.

CZECH REPUBLIC

@Czech Republic:Introduction

Background: After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet
sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize party rule and
create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the
following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the
collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its
freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the
country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components,
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Now a member of NATO, the Czech
Republic has moved toward integration in world markets, a development
that poses both opportunities and risks.

@Czech Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered
the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of
post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure
to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in
Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May.
The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors
worried that the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of
GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in
vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The
growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand
and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity.
The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth
dropped to 0.3% in 1997, -2.3% in 1998, and -0.5% in 1999. The basic
transition problem continues to be too much direct and indirect
government influence on the privatized economy. The government
established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a
revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign
companies. Key priorities include accelerating legislative convergence
with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatizing banks and
utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and
investment, is expected to recover in 2000.

@Denmark:Economy

Economy - overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry,
extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards,
and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of
food. The center-left coalition government is concentrating on
reducing the unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as
following the previous government's policies of maintaining low
inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also vows to
maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered marginal income
tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial
competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms; increased
research and development funds; and improved welfare services for the
neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Denmark chose not to join
the 11 other EU members who launched the euro on 1 January 1999.

@Djibouti:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on service activities
connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free
trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in
the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty
rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most
food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit
port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support
its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An
unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major problem.
Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the
franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated
35% over the last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a
high population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Also,
renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal
external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic
difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term
external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
foreign aid donors.

DOMINICA

@Dominica:Introduction

Background: Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which
made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after
independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and
tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia
CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who
remained in office for 15 years.

@Dominica:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture and is highly
vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 21% of GDP and employs
40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped out
one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The economy's recovery
continued in 1998, fueled by increases in construction, soap
production, and tourist arrivals. The government is attempting to
develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
island's production base.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: In December 1996, incoming President FERNANDEZ
presented a bold reform package for this Caribbean economy - including
the devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales
taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices - in an
attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete
internationally. Even though most reforms are stalled in the
legislature - including the intellectual property rights bill, social
security reform, and a new electricity law first submitted in 1993 -
the economy has grown vigorously under FERNANDEZ's administration.
Construction, tourism and telecommunications are leading the advance.
The government is working to increase electric generating capacity, a
key to continued economic growth; the state electricity company was
finally privatized following numerous delays. The continuation of this
vigorous growth in 2000 will depend on the policies adopted by the new
administration.

ECUADOR

@Ecuador:Introduction

Background: The "Republic of the Equator" was one of three countries
that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others
being Colombia and Venezuela). Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost
territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war
with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999.

@Ecuador:Economy

Economy - overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments. In recent years, growth has been uneven due to
ill-conceived fiscal stabilization measures. The aftermath of El Nino
and depressed oil market of 1997-98 drove Ecuador's economy into a
free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999 saw the banking sector
collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented default on
external loans later that year. Continued economic instability drove a
70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which eventually
forced a desperate government to dollarize the currency regime in
2000. The move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the
ouster of the government. The new president, Gustavo NOBOA has yet to
complete negotiations for a long sought IMF accord. He will find it
difficult to push through the reforms necessary to make dollarization
work in the long-run.

EGYPT

@Egypt:Introduction

Background: Nominally independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of the Aswan
High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the
time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of
Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world)
will continue to stress Egyptian society and overtax resources as the
country enters the new millennium.

@Egypt:Economy

Economy - overview: A series of IMF arrangements - coupled with
massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in
the Gulf war coalition - helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic
performance during the 1990s. Through sound fiscal and monetary
policies, Cairo tamed inflation, slashed budget deficits, and built up
foreign reserves. Although the pace of structural reforms - such as
privatization and new business legislation - has been slower than the
IMF envisioned, Egypt's steps toward a more market-oriented economy
have prompted increased foreign investment. Lower combined hard
currency inflows - from tourism, worker remittances, oil revenues, and
Suez Canal tolls - in 1998 and the first half of 1999 resulted in
pressure on the Egyptian pound and sporadic dollar shortages, but
external payments were not in crisis. Despite ample reserves, the
Central Bank did not provide sufficient hard currency to commercial
banks and Cairo restricted imports for a short period; these
developments confirmed to some investors and currency traders that
government financial operations lack sufficient coordination and
openness. Monetary pressures have since eased, however, with the
continued oil price recovery starting in mid-1999 and a moderate
rebound in tourism. Increased gas exports are a major plus factor in
future growth.

@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

Economy - overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil
reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years.
Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP.
Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial
Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the
deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid
programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
since 1993 because of the government's gross corruption and
mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government
officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources
include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. The
country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994. Boosts in production, along with high world oil prices,
should further stimulate growth in 2000-2001.

ERITREA

@Eritrea:Introduction

Background: Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A border war with
Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 remains unresolved.

@Eritrea:Economy

Economy - overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
Eritrea faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor
country. The economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture, with
80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The small
industrial sector consists mainly of light industries with outmoded
technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is substantially augmented by
worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come from custom
duties and taxes on income and sales. Road construction is a top
domestic priority. In the long term, Eritrea may benefit from the
development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Eritrea's
economic future depends on its ability to master fundamental social
and economic problems, e.g., by reducing illiteracy, promoting job
creation, expanding technical training, attracting foreign investment,
and streamlining the bureaucracy. The most immediate threat to the
economy, however, is the possible expansion of the border conflict
with Ethiopia, which broke out in May 1998. The hostilities have
drained away substantial resources vital to Eritrea's economic
development.

economically since it regained independence in 1991 largely because of
the impact of the August 1998 Russian financial crisis. Estonia joined

continued its EU accession talks. GDP is forecast to grow 4% in 2000.
Privatization of energy, telecommunications, railways, and other
state-owned companies will continue in 2000. Estonia expects to
complete its preparations for EU membership by the end of 2002.

ETHIOPIA

@Ethiopia:Introduction

Background: Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule, one exception
being the Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974 a military junta, the
Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SALASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and
established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings,
wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was
finally toppled by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A constitution was
adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in
1995. A border war with Eritrea that erupted in May 1998 has
strengthened the ruling coalition, but has hurt the nation's economy.

Flag description: three equal horizontal bands of green (top), yellow,
and red with a yellow pentagram and single yellow rays emanating from
the angles between the points on a light blue disk centered on the
three bands; Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, and
the colors of her flag were so often adopted by other African
countries upon independence that they became known as the pan-African
colors

@Ethiopia:Economy

Economy - overview: Ethiopia's economy is based on agriculture, which
accounts for half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment.
The agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought and
poor cultivation practices, and as many as 4.6 million people need
food assistance annually. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy,
and Ethiopia earned $267 million in 1999 by exporting 105,000 metric
tons. According to current estimates, coffee contributes 10% of
Ethiopia's GDP. More than 15 million people (25% of the population)
derive their livelihood from the coffee sector. Other exports include
live animals, hides, gold, and qat. In December 1999, Ethiopia signed
a $1.4 billion joint venture deal to develop a huge natural gas field
in the Somali Regional State. The war with Eritrea has forced the
government to spend scarce resources on the military and forced the
government to scale back ambitious development plans. Foreign
investment has declined significantly. Government taxes imposed in
late 1999 to raise money for the war will depress an already weak
economy. The war has forced the government to improve roads and other
parts of the previously neglected infrastructure, but only certain
regions of the nation have benefited.

@Faroe Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: After the severe economic troubles of the early
1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch, the Faroe Islands
have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in
mid-1998. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing means
the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden
their economic base by building new fish-processing plants. Oil finds
close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the immediate
area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity. The
Faroese are supported by a substantial annual subsidy from Denmark.

FIJI

@Fiji:Introduction

Background: Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as
a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military
coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as
dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers
brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). A 1990
constitution favored native Melanesian control of Fiji, but led to
heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic
difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority.
Amendments enacted in 1997 made the constitution more equitable. Free
and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an
Indo-Fijian. Fiji has been a major contributor to UN peacekeeping
missions in various parts of the world.

@Fiji:Economy

Economy - overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports
and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign
exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity.
Roughly 300,000 tourists visit each year, including thousands of
Americans following the start of regularly scheduled non-stop air
service from Los Angeles. Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because the
sugar industry suffered from low world prices and rent disputes
between farmers and landowners. Drought in 1998 further damaged the
sugar industry, but its recovery in 1999 contributed to robust GDP
growth. Long-term problems include low investment and uncertain
property rights.

@Finland:Introduction

Background: Ruled by Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries and by
Russia from 1809, Finland finally won its independence in 1917. During
World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and fend
off invasions by the Soviet Union and Germany. In the subsequent half
century, the Finns have made a remarkable transformation from a
farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per
capita income is now on par with Western Europe. As a member of the
European Union, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro
system at its initiation in January 1999.

@Finland:Economy

Economy - overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing -
principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and
electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equaling more
than one-third of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products.
Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation
for the rural population. The economy has come back from the recession
of 1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed
foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between
Finland and the former Soviet Union. Rapidly increasing integration
with Western Europe - Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the
euro monetary system (EMU) on 1 January 1999 - will dominate the
economic picture over the next several years. Growth in 2000 will
probably be at the same level as in 1999, enough to continue the
decline in unemployment from its current high level.

@France:Introduction

Background: Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II,
France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and
rank as a dominant nation-state. Since 1958, it has constructed a
presidential democracy resistant to the instabilities experienced in
earlier parliamentary democracies. In recent years, its reconciliation
and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic
integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro in January
1999. Today, France is at the forefront of European states seeking to
exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a
more unified and capable European defense and security apparatus.

@France:Economy

Economy - overview: France's economy combines modern capitalistic
methods with extensive, but declining, government intervention. The
government retains considerable influence over key segments of each
sector, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, and
telecommunication firms. It has been gradually relaxing its control
over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly
selling off holdings in France Telecom, in Air France, and in the
insurance, banking, and defense industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of
fertile land, the application of modern technology, and subsidies have
combined to make France the leading agricultural producer in Western
Europe. Persistently high unemployment will continue to pose a major
problem for the government; a 35-hour work week is being introduced.
France has shied away from cutting exceptionally generous social
welfare benefits or the enormous state bureaucracy, preferring to pare
defense spending and raise taxes to keep the deficit down. France
joined 10 other EU members to launch the euro on 1 January 1999.

@French Guiana:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully
exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn
logs for export. Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area,
where the population is largely concentrated; rice and manioc are the
major crops. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports of food and
energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly among younger
workers.

@French Polynesia:Economy

Economy - overview: Since 1962, when France stationed military
personnel in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a
subsistence economy to one in which a high proportion of the work
force is either employed by the military or supports the tourist
industry. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a
primary source of hard currency earnings. The small manufacturing
sector primarily processes agricultural products. The territory
benefited from a five-year (1994-98) development agreement with France
aimed principally at creating new jobs.

@Gabon:Economy

Economy - overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that
of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp
decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a
large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to
face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium
exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, the economy is
hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened
to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral
debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with
official and private creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone
currency by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary
surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a
one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced
Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning in late
1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January
1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF
mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on
off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on
its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound
of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered
Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. With support from higher
oil prices, growth will move up in 2000-01.

GAZA STRIP

@Gaza Strip:Introduction

Background: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and
responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the
West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim
Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning
Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River
Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The
DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
transitional period for external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Permanent status
is to be determined through direct negotiations, which resumed in
September 1999 after a three-year hiatus.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - under the
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo Agreement
of May 1994 - have deteriorated since the early 1990s. Real per capita
GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36% between 1992
and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and
robust population growth. The downturn in economic activity was
largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of
generalized border closures in response to security incidents in
Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity
market relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious
negative social effect of this downturn has been the emergence of
chronic unemployment; average unemployment rates in the WBGS during
the 1980s were generally under 5%; by the mid-1990s this level had
risen to over 20%. Since 1997 Israel's use of comprehensive closures
has decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce
the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement
of Palestinian goods and labor. In October 1999, Israel permitted the
opening of a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in
accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement. These changes to the
conduct of economic activity have fueled a moderate economic recovery
in 1998-99.

@Georgia:Economy

Economy - overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved
around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and
grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small
industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and
textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including
natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy
resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has
suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and
World Bank, made substantial economic gains since 1995, increasing GDP
growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy continues to
experience large budget deficits due to a failure to collect tax
revenues. Georgia also still suffers from energy shortages; it
privatized the distribution network in 1998, and deliveries are
steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its hopes for long-term
recovery on the development of an international transportation
corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The
growing trade deficit, continuing problems with tax evasion and
corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the short-term economic
picture. However, revived investment could spur higher economic growth
in 2000, perhaps up to 6%.

GERMANY

@Germany:Introduction

Background: As Western Europe's richest and most populous nation,
Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political,
and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed the
country in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th
century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers
of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent
of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western
Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic
Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western
economic and security organizations, the EC and NATO, while the
communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The
decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German
unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable
funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards.
In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries formed a common
European currency, the euro.

@Germany:Economy

Economy - overview: Germany possesses the world's third most
technologically powerful economy after the US and Japan, but its basic
capitalistic economy has started to struggle under the burden of
generous social benefits. Structural rigidities - like a high rate of
social contributions on wages - have made unemployment a long-term,
not just cyclical, problem, while Germany's aging population has
pushed social security outlays to exceed contributions from workers.
The integration and upgrading of the eastern German economy remains a
costly long-term problem, with annual transfers from the west
amounting to roughly $100 billion. Growth slowed to 1.5% in 1999,
largely due to lower export demand and still-low business confidence.
Recovering Asian demand, a push for fiscal consolidation, and newly
proposed business and income tax cuts - if passed - are expected to
boost growth back to trend rates around 2.5% in 2000 and beyond. The
adoption of a common European currency and the general political and
economic integration of Europe will bring major changes to the German
economy in the early 21st century.

banning of political parties. A new constitution, restoring multiparty
politics, was approved in 1992.

@Ghana:Economy

Economy - overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa.
Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial
and technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 40% of GDP and
employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97,
Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi,
and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures. A
rebound in gold prices is likely to push growth over 5% in 2000-01.

@Gibraltar:Economy

Economy - overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping
trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international
conference center. The British military presence has been sharply
reduced and now contributes about 11% to the local economy. The
financial sector accounts for 20% of GDP; tourism (almost 6 million
visitors in 1998), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer
goods also generate revenue. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major
structural change from a public to a private sector economy, but
changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level
of employment.

@Greece:Introduction

Background: Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire
in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half
of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
territories with Greek-speaking populations. Following the defeat of
communist rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military
dictatorship, which in 1967 had suspended many political liberties and
forced the king to flee the country, was itself overthrown seven years
later. Democratic elections in 1974 abolished the monarchy and created
a parliamentary republic; Greece joined the EU in 1981.

@Greece:Economy

Economy - overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for about half of GDP. The government plans
to privatize some leading state enterprises. Tourism is a key
industry, providing a large portion of GDP and foreign exchange
earnings. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 4%
of GDP. The economy has improved steadily over the last few years, as
the government has tightened policy with the goal of qualifying Greece
to join the EU's single currency (the euro) in 2001. In particular,
Greece has cut its budget deficit below 2% of GDP and tightened
monetary policy, with the result that inflation fell below 4% by the
end of 1998 - the lowest rate in 26 years - and averaged only 2.6% in
1999. Further restructuring of the economy and the reduction of
unemployment remain major challenges.

@Greenland:Economy

Economy - overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland
Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1990. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

@Grenada:Economy

Economy - overview: In this island economy progress in fiscal reforms
and prudent macroeconomic management have boosted annual growth to
5%-6% in 1998-99. The increase in economic activity has been led by
construction and trade. Tourist facilities are being expanded; tourism
is the leading foreign exchange earner. Major short-term concerns are
the rising fiscal deficit and the deterioration in the external
account balance. Grenada shares a common central bank and a common
currency with seven other members of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS).

@Guadeloupe:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It also depends on France for large subsidies
and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the
US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands.
The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other
crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are
cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.
Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.

@Guam:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends mainly on US military spending
and on tourist revenue. Over the past 20 years, the tourist industry
has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
expansion of older ones. More than 1 million tourists visit Guam each
year. The industry suffered a setback in 1998 because of the
continuing Japanese recession; the Japanese normally make up almost
90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods are imported. Guam
faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
offset the impact of military downsizing.

@Guatemala:Economy

Economy - overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth of
GDP, two-thirds of exports, and half of the labor force. Coffee,
sugar, and bananas are the main products. Manufacturing and
construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since assuming office in
January 1996, former President ARZU worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization. The signing of
the peace accords in December 1996, which ended 36 years of civil war,
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. In 1998, Hurricane
Mitch caused relatively little damage to Guatemala compared to its
neighbors. Remaining challenges include beefing up government
revenues, negotiating further assistance from international donors,
and increasing the efficiency and openness of both government and
private financial operations. Growth should remain at the same level
in 2000 provided world agricultural prices do not plunge.

Background: Independent from France since 1958, Guinea did not hold
democratic elections until 1993 when Gen. Lansana CONTE (head of the
military government) was elected president in disputed balloting.
Security clampdowns continue, although not as severe as in earlier
decades. Reelected in 1998, the president faced growing criticism in
1999 for his jailing of a major opposition leader and widespread
economic malaise. Unrest in Sierra Leone also continued to threaten
Guinea's stability.

@Guinea:Economy

Economy - overview: Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, yet remains a poor underdeveloped nation. The
agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force. Guinea possesses
over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the second largest
bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about 75% of exports
in 1998. Long-run improvements in government fiscal arrangements,
literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to move
out of poverty. The government made encouraging progress in budget
management in 1997-99. Even with a recovery in prices for some of
Guinea's main commodity exports, annual GDP is unlikely to increase by
more than 5% in 2000-2001.

@Guyana:Economy

Economy - overview: Severe drought and political turmoil contributed
to Guyana's negative growth of -1.8% for 1998 following six straight
years of growth of 5% or better. Growth came back to a positive 1.8%
in 1999. Underlying growth factors have included expansion in the key
agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for
business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a moderate
inflation rate, and continued support by international organizations.
President JAGDEO, the former finance minister, is taking steps to
reform the economy, including drafting an investment code and
restructuring the inefficient and unresponsive public sector. Problems
include a shortage of skilled labor and an inadequate and poorly
maintained transportation system. Also, electricity has been in short
supply; the privatization of the sector in August 1999 is expected to
improve prospects. The government must persist in efforts to manage
its sizable external debt and extend its privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

Economy - overview: About 80% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector,
which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs
about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country
has experienced little job creation since President PREVAL took office
in February 1996, although the informal economy is growing. Failure to
reach agreements with international sponsors have denied Haiti badly
needed budget and development assistance. Meeting aid conditions in
2000 will be especially challenging in the face of mounting popular
criticism of reforms.

@Honduras:Introduction

Background: Part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
became as independent nation in 1821. After two and one-half decades
of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to
power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan government and
an ally to Salvadoran government forces fighting against leftist
guerrillas.

@Honduras:Economy

Economy - overview: Honduras spent 1999 primarily recovering from
Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 5,000 people and caused about
$3 billion in damage. Although it is slated to receive about $2.76
billion in international aid, the economy shrank 3% with widening
current account and fiscal deficits in 1999. It nevertheless met most
of its macroeconomic targets, and 2000 should see economic recovery as
reconstruction projects make progress and the agricultural sector
recovers. Honduras may also get relief from its $4.4 billion external
debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.

HONG KONG

@Hong Kong:Introduction

Background: Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded
by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the
UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this
agreement, China has promised that, under its "one country, two
systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be
practiced in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the
next 50 years.

@Hong Kong:Economy

Economy - overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy
highly dependent on international trade. Natural resources are
limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports
and exports, including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value.
Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1 July
1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China. Per capita
GDP compares with the level in the four big countries of Western
Europe. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% in 1989-97. The widespread
Asian economic difficulties in 1998 hit this trade-dependent economy
quite hard, with GDP down 5%. The economy is recovering, with growth
of 1.8% in 1999 to be followed by projected growth of 3.7% in 2000.

HUNGARY

@Hungary:Introduction

Background: Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which collapsed in World War I. It fell under communist rule following
World War II. A revolt in 1956 and an announced withdrawal from the
Warsaw Pact was met with massive military intervention by Moscow. In
the more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to dissolve
the Warsaw Pact and steadily shifted toward multiparty democracy and a
market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,
Hungary developed close political and economic ties to Western Europe.
It joined NATO in 1999 and is a frontrunner in a future expansion of
the EU.

@Iceland:Economy

Economy - overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 70% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power),
Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The
economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops
in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products,
aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to
continue its policies of reducing the budget and current account
deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising
agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and
privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to
EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing
control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has been
diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last
decade, and new developments in software production, biotechnology,
and financial services are taking place. The tourism sector is also
expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale-watching.
Growth is likely to slow in 2000, to a still respectable 3.5%.

INDIA

@India:Introduction

Background: Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism under
Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to independence in 1947. The
subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the
smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two
countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate
nation of Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in India include the
ongoing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation,
environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic strife, all
this despite impressive gains in economic investment and output.

@India:Economy

Economy - overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. More than a third of
the population is too poor to be able to afford an adequate diet, and
market surveys indicate that fewer than 5% of all households had an
annual income equivalent to $2,300 or more in 1995-96. India's
international payments position remained strong in 1999 with adequate
foreign exchange reserves, reasonably stable exchange rates, and
booming exports of software services. Lower production of some
nonfoodgrain crops offset recovery in industrial production. Strong
demand for India's high technology exports will bolster growth in
2000.

INDIAN OCEAN

@Indian Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Indian
Ocean remains the third-largest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Southern Ocean
and Arctic Ocean).

@Indian Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and
Australia

Geographic coordinates: 20 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references: World

Area:
total: 68.556 million sq km
note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Great
Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Mozambique Channel,
Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other tributary water
bodies

Area - comparative: about 5.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 66,526 km

Climate: northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon
(June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in
the southern Indian Ocean

Terrain: surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular
system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air
results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and
currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean
Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel
aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea,
Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of
Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the
Lombok Strait

@Indian Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the
Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of
hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia,
Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's
offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich
in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited
by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia,
Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

INDONESIA

@Indonesia:Introduction

Background: The world's largest archipelago, Indonesia achieved
independence from the Netherlands in 1949. Current issues include:
implementing IMF-mandated reforms of the banking sector, effecting a
transition to a popularly elected government after years of rule by
dictators, addressing charges of cronyism and corruption among the
Chinese-dominated business class, dealing with alleged human rights
violations by the military, and resolving growing pressures for some
form of autonomy or independence in certain regions such as Aceh and
Irian Jaya. On 30 August 1999 a provincial referendum for independence
was overwhelmingly approved by the people of Timor Timur. Concurrence
followed by Indonesia's national legislature, and the name East Timor
was provisionally adopted. The independent status of East Timor has
yet to be formally established.

@Indonesia:Economy

Economy - overview: The Indonesian economy stabilized in 1999,
following the sharp contraction and high inflation of 1998. By
following tight monetary policy, the government reduced inflation from
over 70% in 1998 to 2% in 1999. Although interest rates spiked as high
as 70% in response to the monetary contraction, they fell rapidly to
the 10% to 15% range. The economy stopped its free-fall as GDP showed
some growth in the second half of 1999, although GDP for the year as a
whole showed no growth. The government managed to recapitalize a
handful of private banks and has begun recapitalizing the state-owned
banking sector. New lending, however, remains almost unavailable as
banks continue to be wary of issuing new debt in an environment where
little progress has been made in restructuring the huge burden of
outstanding debts. IMF payments were suspended late in 1999 as the
result of evidence that a private bank had illegally funneled payments
it received from the government to one of the political parties. The
government has forecast growth of 3.8% for FY00/01. The spread of
sectarian violence and continuing dissatisfaction with the pace of
bank and debt restructuring will make it difficult for Indonesia to
attract the private investment necessary to achieve this goal.

@Iran:Introduction

Background: Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic
republic in 1979 after the ruling shah was forced into exile.
Conservative clerical forces subsequently crushed westernizing liberal
elements. Militant Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on
4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88,
Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq over disputed
territory. The key current issue is how rapidly the country should
open up to the modernizing influences of the outside world.

@Iran:Economy

Economy - overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market reform plans of
former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he will pursue
diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy although he has made
little progress toward that goal. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt
service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997 and
deteriorated further in 1998 because of lower oil prices. The
subsequent zoom in oil prices in 1999 afforded Iran fiscal breathing
room but does not solve Iran's structural economic problems.

outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; Iran occupies two islands
in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb (called Tunb as
Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in Persian by
Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in Arabic by UAE and
Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); Iran jointly administers
with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (called
Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)
- over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since
1992, including access restrictions and a military build-up on the
island; the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the
region in protesting these Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are
not yet determined among Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and
Turkmenistan

Illicit drugs: despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran remains
a key transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe;
domestic consumption of narcotics remains a persistent problem and
Iranian press reports estimate that there are at least 1.2 million
drug users in the country

@Iraq:Introduction

Background: Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an
independent kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but
in actuality a series of military strongmen have ruled the country
since then, the latest being SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with
Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-1988). In
August 1990 Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN
coalition forces during January-February 1991. The victors did not
occupy Iraq, however, thus allowing the regime to stay in control.
Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required
Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles
and to allow UN verification inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in
effect due to incomplete Iraqi compliance with relevant UNSC
resolutions.

@Iraq:Economy

Economy - overview: Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector,
which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange
earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures,
borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic sanctions, and damage from military action by
an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
reduced economic activity. The government's policies of supporting
large military and internal security forces and of allocating
resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages.
The implementation of the UN's oil-for-food program in December 1996
has helped improve economic conditions. For the first six six-month
phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export limited amounts of
oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods. In
December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export under
the oil-for-food program as much oil as required to meet humanitarian
needs. Oil exports are now about three-quarters their prewar level.
Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while medical
supplies and health care services are steadily improving. Per capita
output and living standards are still well below the prewar level, but
any estimates have a wide range of error.

Disputes - international: Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations
in 1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 1994, Iraq
formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been
spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to
Bubiyan and Warbah islands although the government continues periodic
rhetorical challenges; dispute over water development plans by Turkey
for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers

IRELAND

@Ireland:Introduction

Background: A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several
years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from
the UK for the 26 southern counties; the six northern counties
(Ulster) remained part of Great Britain. In 1948 Ireland withdrew from
the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973.
Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of Ireland and
have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A peace
settlement for Northern Ireland, approved in 1998, has not yet been
implemented.

@Ireland:Economy

Economy - overview: Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent
economy with growth averaging a robust 9% in 1995-99. Agriculture,
once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which
accounts for 39% of GDP and about 80% of exports and employs 28% of
the labor force. Although exports remain the primary engine for
Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in
consumer spending and recovery in both construction and business
investment. Over the past decade, the Irish government has implemented
a series of national economic programs designed to curb inflation,
reduce government spending, and promote foreign investment. The
unemployment rate has been halved; job creation remains a primary
concern of government policy. Recent efforts have concentrated on
improving workers' qualifications and the education system. Ireland
joined in launching the euro currency system in January 1999 along
with 10 other EU nations. The construction and other sectors are
beginning to press against capacity, and growth is expected to drop in
2000, perhaps by 1 percentage point.

ISRAEL

@Israel:Introduction

Background: Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and
Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the
Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the
deep tensions between the two sides. The territories occupied by
Israel since the 1967 war are not included in the Isreal country
profile, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework
established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral
negotiations are being conducted between Israel and Palestinian
representatives (from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)
and Israel and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement. On 25 April
1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt
Peace Treaty. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan
were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

@Israel:Economy

Economy - overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market
economy with substantial government participation. It depends on
imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed
its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel
is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains.
Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits
and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable
current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's
external debt is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic
and military aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR
topped 750,000 during the period 1989-99, bringing the population of
Israel from the former Soviet Union to 1 million, one-sixth of the
total population, and adding scientific and professional expertise of
substantial value for the economy's future. The influx, coupled with
the opening of new markets at the end of the Cold War, energized
Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in the early 1990s. But growth
began slowing in 1996 when the government imposed tighter fiscal and
monetary policies and the immigration bonus petered out. Those
policies brought inflation down to record low levels in 1999 and,
coupled with improved prospects for the Middle East peace process, are
creating a climate for stronger GDP growth in the year 2000.

ITALY

@Italy:Introduction

Background: Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the
city-states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under King Victor
EMMANUEL. The Fascist dictatorship of Benito MUSSOLINI that took over
after World War I led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and
Italian defeat in World War II. Revival followed. Italy was a charter
member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined
the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe,
including the introduction of the euro in 1999. Persistent problems
include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime,
corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical
standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.

@Italy:Economy

Economy - overview: Italy has a diversified industrial economy with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed
industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed
agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw
materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements
are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant
with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU);
representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an
update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with
having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU
requirements. Italy must work to stimulate employment, promote wage
flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal
economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000,
led by investment and exports.

Background: Jamaica gained full independence within the British
Commonwealth in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the
1970s led to recurrent violence and a dropoff in tourism. Elections in
1980 saw the democratic socialists voted out of office, and a more
conservative government installed. Political violence marred elections
during the 1990s.

@Jamaica:Economy

Economy - overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation - although inflationary pressures
are mounting - and stabilize the exchange rate, but have resulted in
the slowdown of economic growth (moving from 1.5% in 1992 to 0.5% in
1995). In 1996, GDP showed negative growth (-1.4%) and remained
negative through 1999. Serious problems include: high interest rates;
increased foreign competition; the weak financial condition of
business in general resulting in receiverships or closures and
downsizings of companies; the shift in investment portfolios to
non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a pressured,
sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise trade
deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
sector. Depressed economic conditions in 1999 led to increased civil
unrest, including a mounting crime rate. Jamaica's medium-term
prospects will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive
sectors, maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the
labor environment, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing
proper fiscal and monetary policies.

JAPAN

@Japan:Introduction

Background: While retaining its time-honored culture, Japan rapidly
absorbed Western technology during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. After its devastating defeat in World War II, Japan
recovered to become the second most powerful economy in the world and
a staunch ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a
symbol of national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful
politicians, bureaucrats, and business executives. The economy
experienced a major slowdown in the 1990s following three decades of
unprecedented growth.

@Japan:Economy

Economy - overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
rapidity to the rank of second most technologically powerful economy
in the world after the US and third largest economy in the world after
the US and China. One notable characteristic of the economy is the
working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in
closely knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been
the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the
urban labor force. Both features are now eroding. Industry, the most
important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw
materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly
subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the
world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of
its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one
of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of
the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had
been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the
1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in
1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during
the late 1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in
1997-98 Japan experienced a wrenching recession, centered about
financial difficulties in the banking system and real estate markets
and exacerbated by rigidities in corporate structures and labor
markets. In 1999 output started to stabilize as emergency government
spending began to take hold and business confidence gradually
improved. The crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the
population are two major long-run problems. Robotics constitutes a key
long-term economic strength, with Japan possessing 410,000 of the
world's 720,000 "working robots".

@Jersey:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on international
financial services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower,
tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped
mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide
and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted
for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the
economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has
encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an
electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional
manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements
are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light
taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

JORDAN

@Jordan:Introduction

Background: For most of its history since independence from British
administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN (1953-1999).
A pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from
the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and
a large internal Palestinian population, through several wars and coup
attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary elections and gradually
permitted political liberalization; in 1994 a formal peace treaty was
signed with Israel.

@Jordan:Economy

Economy - overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil. The Persian
Gulf crisis, which began in August 1990, aggravated Jordan's already
serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling
negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker remittances, and trade
contracted; and refugees flooded the country, producing serious
balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth, and straining
government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992, largely due to
the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning from the Gulf.
After averaging 9% in 1992-95, GDP growth averaged only 2% during
1996-99. In an attempt to spur growth, King ABDALLAH has undertaken
limited economic reform, including partial privatization of some state
owned enterprises and Jordan's entry in January 2000 into the World
Trade Organization (WTrO). Debt, poverty, and unemployment are
fundamental ongoing economic problems.

KAZAKHSTAN

@Kazakhstan:Introduction

Background: During the 1950s and 1960s Soviet citizens were urged to
help settle the "New Lands" of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.
The influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but including some deported
minority nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence has caused many of
these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include: resolving ethnic
differences; speeding up market reforms; establishing stable relations
with Russia, China, and other foreign powers; and developing and
expanding the country's abundant energy resources.

irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of
chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in
the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals
and salination from poor infrastructure and wasteful irrigation
practices

@Kazakhstan:Economy

Economy - overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former
Soviet republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years. Kazakhstan's
economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due
to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A
bright spot in 1999 was the recovery of international oil prices,
which, combined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain
harvest, pulled the economy out of recession.

@Kenya:Economy

Economy - overview: Kenya is well placed to serve as an engine of
growth in East Africa, but its economy is stagnating because of poor
management and uneven commitment to reform. In 1993, the government of
Kenya implemented a program of economic liberalization and reform that
included the removal of import licensing, price controls, and foreign
exchange controls. With the support of the World Bank, IMF, and other
donors, the reforms led to a brief turnaround in economic performance
following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real
GDP grew 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation remained under
control. Growth slowed in 1997-99 however. Political violence damaged
the tourist industry, and Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Program lapsed due to the government's failure to maintain reform or
address public sector corruption. A new economic team was put in place
in 1999 to revitalize the reform effort, strengthen the civil service,
and curb corruption, but wary donors continue to question the
government's commitment to sound economic policy. Long-term barriers
to development include electricity shortages, the government's
continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors, endemic
corruption, and the country's high population growth rate.

KIRIBATI

@Kiribati:Introduction

Background: The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in
1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati.
The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and
Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.

@Kiribati:Geography

Location: Oceania, group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, straddling
the equator, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia; note
- on 1 January 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the International
Date Line from the middle of the country to include its easternmost
islands and make it the same day throughout the country

Maritime claims:
exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
territorial sea: 12 nm

Climate: tropical; marine, hot and humid, moderated by trade winds

Terrain: mostly low-lying coral atolls surrounded by extensive reefs

arable land: 0%
permanent crops: 51%
permanent pastures: 0%
forests and woodland: 3%
other: 46% (1993 est.)

Irrigated land: NA sq km

Natural hazards: typhoons can occur any time, but usually November to
March; occasional tornadoes; low-level of some of the islands make
them very sensitive to sea-level rise

Environment - current issues: heavy pollution in lagoon of south
Tarawa atoll due to heavy migration mixed with traditional practices
such as lagoon latrines and open-pit dumping; ground water at risk

Environment - international agreements:
party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered
Species, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection
signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography - note: 20 of the 33 islands are inhabited; Banaba (Ocean
Island) in Kiribati is one of the three great phosphate rock islands
in the Pacific Ocean - the others are Makatea in French Polynesia, and
Nauru

@Kiribati:Economy

Economy - overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic
development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak
infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Tourism
provides more than one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an
early stage of development as is the expansion of private sector
initiatives. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK and Japan, is
a critical supplement to GDP, equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.
Remittances from workers abroad account for more than $5 million each
year.

@Korea:Economy

Economy - overview: North Korea ranks among the world's most centrally
planned and isolated economies. The resulting economic distortions and
the government's reluctance to publicize economic data limit the
amount of reliable information available. State-owned industry
produces nearly all manufactured goods, and the regime continues to
devote its focus on heavy and military industries at the expense of
light and consumer industries. Economic conditions remain stagnant at
best and the country's deepening economic slide has been fueled by
acute energy shortages, poorly maintained and aging industrial
facilities, and a lack of new investment. The agricultural outlook,
though slightly improved over previous years, remains weak. The
combined effects of serious fertilizer shortages, successive natural
disasters, and structural constraints - such as marginal arable land
and a short growing season - have reduced staple grain output to more
than 1 million tons less than what the country needs to meet even
minimum international requirements. The steady flow of international
food aid has been critical in meeting the population's basic food
needs. The impact of other forms of humanitarian assistance such as
medical supplies and agricultural assistance largely has been limited
to local areas. Even with aid, malnutrition rates are among the
world's highest and estimates of mortality range in the hundreds of
thousands as a direct result of starvation or famine-related diseases.

@Kuwait:Economy

Economy - overview: Kuwait is a small, relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export
revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has
practically no arable land, thus preventing development of
agriculture. With the exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on
food imports. About 75% of potable water must be distilled or
imported. Higher oil prices reduced the budget deficit from $5.5
billion to $3 billion in 1999, and prices are expected to remain
relatively strong throughout 2000. The government is proceeding slowly
with reforms. It inaugurated Kuwait's first free-trade zone in 1999
and will continue discussions with foreign oil companies to develop
fields in the northern part of the country.

@Kuwait:Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: in November 1994, Iraq formally accepted the
UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been spelled out in
Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993), and 883 (1993);
this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to Bubiyan and Warbah
islands; ownership of Qaruh and Umm al Maradim islands disputed by
Saudi Arabia

@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

Economy - overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been one of
the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying
out market reforms. Following a successful stabilization program,
which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997, attention is
turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in
enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe since
the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995
production began to recover and exports began to increase. Pensioners,
unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears
continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in
the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97. The government has
adopted a series of measures to combat such severe problems as
excessive external debt, inflation, inadequate revenue collection, and
the spillover from Russia's economic disorders. Kyrgyzstan had
moderate growth in 1999 of 3.4% with a similar rate expected for 2000.

@Laos:Economy

Economy - overview: The government of Laos - one of the few remaining
official communist states - began decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise in 1986. The results, starting from an
extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 7% in 1988-96.
Since mid-1996, however, reform efforts have slowed, and the economy
has suffered as a result. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade
with Thailand, it was further damaged by the regional financial crisis
beginning in 1997. From June 1997 to June 1999 the Lao kip lost 87%,
and reached a crisis point in September 1999 when it fluctuated
wildly, falling from 3,500 kip to the dollar to 9,000 kip to the
dollar in a matter of weeks. Now that the currency has stabilized,
however, the government seems content to let the current situation
persist, despite 140% inflation in 1999 and limited foreign exchange
reserves. A landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure, Laos
has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and limited external and
internal telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few
urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and
provides 80% of total employment. For the foreseeable future the
economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other
international sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral aid
donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil erosion will
hamper efforts to attain a high rate of GDP growth.

@Latvia:Introduction

Background: After a brief period of independence between the two World
Wars, Latvia was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It reestablished its
independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the
Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to
Moscow. Latvia continues to revamp its economy for eventual
integration into various Western European political and economic

Economy - overview: In 1999 Latvia, a transitional economy,
experienced zero GDP growth as it continued to feel the impact of the
August 1998 Russian financial crisis. Latvia officially joined the
World Trade Organization (WTrO) in February 1999 - the first Baltic
state to join - band was invited at the Helsinki EU Summit in December
1999 to begin accession talks in early 2000. Unemployment reached 9.6%
in 1999, up from 9.2% in 1998 and 6.7% in 1997. Privatization of large
state-owned utilities, especially the energy sector, faced more delays
in 1999, but is expected to accelerate in the next two years. Latvia
projects 3.5% GDP growth, 3% inflation, and a 2% fiscal deficit in
2000. Preparing for EU membership by 2003 remains a top foreign policy
priority.

LEBANON

@Lebanon:Introduction

Background: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since 1991 and the
end of the devastating 16-year civil war. Under the Ta'if Accord - the
blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established
a more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a
greater say in the political process while institutionalizing
sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war, the
Lebanese have conducted several successful elections, most of the
militias have been weakened or disbanded, and the Lebanese Armed
Forces (LAF) have extended central government authority over about
two-thirds of the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains
its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel
maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy
militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of
territory contiguous to its border. Syria maintains about 25,000
troops in Lebanon based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa
Valley. Syria's troop deployment was legitimized by the Arab League
during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies
its continued military presence in Lebanon by citing the continued
weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and the failure of the
Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in
the Ta'if Accord.

@Lebanon:Economy

Economy - overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since the launch
of "Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion reconstruction program
in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity.
Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of less than 3% per year for
1997 and 1998 and only 1% in 1999. During 1992-98, annual inflation
fell from more than 100% to 5%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped
to more than $6 billion from $1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows
have generated foreign payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has
remained relatively stable. Progress also has been made in rebuilding
Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a
$2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central
business district; the stock market reopened in January 1996; and
international banks and insurance companies are returning. The
government nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena.
It has had to fund reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves
and boosting borrowing. Reducing the government budget deficit is a
major goal of the LAHUD government. The stalled peace process and
ongoing violence in southern Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities
that would disrupt vital capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between
rich and poor has widened in the 1990's, resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

@Lesotho:Economy

Economy - overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's only
important natural resource is water. Its economy is based on
subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from miners
employed in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined
steadily over the past several years. In 1996 their remittances added
about 33% to GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. A
small manufacturing base depends largely on farm products which
support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries.
Agricultural products are exported primarily to South Africa. Proceeds
from membership in a common customs union with South Africa form the
majority of government revenue. Although drought has decreased
agricultural activity over the past few years, completion of a major
hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits the sale of water to
South Africa, generating royalties that will be an important source of
income for Lesotho. The pace of parastatal privatization has increased
in recent years. Civil disorder in September 1998 destroyed 80% of the
commercial infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns. Most
firms were not covered by insurance, and the rebuilding of small and
medium business has been a significant challenge in terms of both
economic growth and employment levels. Output dropped 10% in 1998 and
recovered slowly in 1999.

LIBERIA

@Liberia:Introduction

Background: Seven years of civil strife were brought to a close in
1996 when free and open presidential and legislative elections were
held. President TAYLOR now holds strong executive power with no real
political opposition. The years of fighting coupled with the flight of
most businesses has disrupted formal economic activity. A still
unsettled domestic security situation has slowed the process of
rebuilding the social and economic structure of this war-torn country.

@Liberia:Economy

Economy - overview: A civil war in 1989-96 destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them.
Some returned during 1997. Many will not return. Richly endowed with
water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been
small in scope. The democratically elected government, installed in
August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the
implementation of sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the new
government, including the encouragement of foreign investment.

LIBYA

@Libya:Introduction

Background: Since he took power in a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar
Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system - a
combination of socialism and Islam - which he calls the Third
International Theory. Viewing himself as a revolutionary leader, he
used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology
outside Libya, even supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to
hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. Libyan military adventures
failed, e.g., the prolonged foray of Libyan troops into the Aozou
Strip in northern Chad was finally repulsed in 1987. Libyan support
for terrorism decreased after UN sanctions were imposed in 1992. Those
sanctions were suspended in April 1999.

@Libya:Economy

Economy - overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-quarter of GDP. These oil revenues and a
small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in
Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of
society. In this statist society, import restrictions and inefficient
resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and
foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which
account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
requirements. Higher oil prices in 1999 led to an increase in export
revenues and helped to stimulate the economy. Following the suspension
of UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been trying to increase its
attractiveness to foreign investors, and several foreign companies
have visited in search of contracts.

LIECHTENSTEIN

@Liechtenstein:Introduction

Background: The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within
the Holy Roman Empire in 1719; it became a sovereign state in 1806.
Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the
economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to
conclude a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World
War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral) the country's low
taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth.

@Liechtenstein:Economy

Economy - overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 18% -
and easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic
Area (an organization serving as a bridge between European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) and EU) since May 1995. The government is working
to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe.

Background: Independent between the two World Wars, Lithuania was

proclamation was not generally recognized until September of 1991
(following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops
withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently has restructured its economy
for eventual integration into Western European institutions.

@Lithuania:Economy

Economy - overview: Lithuania, the Baltic state that has conducted the
most trade with Russia, faced its own economic and financial crisis in
1999 as a result of the government's wrongfooted economic policies and
its inadequate response to the August 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Preliminary figures indicate 3% negative GDP growth, 10% unemployment
- the highest level since independence in 1991 - and a budget deficit
estimated at between 8 and 9% of GDP. The policies that Prime Minister
KUBILIUS implemented upon taking the helm in November 1999 underscore
a commitment to fiscal restraint, economic stabilization, and
accelerated reforms. The austere 2000 budget in based on a 2% GDP
growth forecast, 3% inflation, and a 2.8% budget deficit. Lithuania
was invited at the Helsinki EU summit in December 1999 to begin EU
accession talks in early 2000. Privatization of the large state-owned
utilities, particularly in the energy sector, and reducing the high
current account deficit remain challenges for the coming year.

LUXEMBOURG

@Luxembourg:Introduction

Background: Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half
of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany
in both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered
into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following
year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of
the European Economic Community (later the European Union) and in 1999
it joined the euro currency area.

@Luxembourg:Economy

Economy - overview: The stable, high-income economy features moderate
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial sector,
until recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more
diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During
the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking,
account for a growing proportion of the economy. Agriculture is based
on small family-owned farms. Luxembourg has especially close trade and
financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands, and as a member of the
EU, enjoys the advantages of the open European market. It joined with
10 other EU members to launch the euro on 1 January 1999.

agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became
the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 20 December
1999. China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems"
formula, China's socialist economic system will not be practiced in
Macau and that Macau will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all
matters except foreign and defense affairs.

@Macau:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on tourism (including
gambling) and textile and fireworks manufacturing. Efforts to
diversify have spawned other small industries - toys, artificial
flowers, and electronics. The tourist sector has accounted for roughly
25% of GDP, and the clothing industry has provided about three-fourths
of export earnings; the gambling industry probably represents over 40%
of GDP. Macau depends on China for most of its food, fresh water, and
energy imports. Japan and Hong Kong are the main suppliers of raw
materials and capital goods. Output dropped 4% in 1998 and the economy
remained weak in 1999. Macau reverted to Chinese administration on 20
December 1999. Gang violence, a dark spot in the economy, probably
will be reduced in 2000 to the advantage of the tourism sector.

@Madagascar:Economy

Economy - overview: Madagascar faces problems of chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 34% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants. Growth should be in
the 5% range in 2000-01.

Economy - overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least
developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with
about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for 37% of GDP and 85% of export revenues. The economy
depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The government faces
strong challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and
health facilities, to face up to environmental problems of
deforestation and erosion, and to deal with the rapidly growing
problem of HIV/AIDS.

@Malaysia:Economy

Economy - overview: Malaysia made a quick economic recovery in 1999
from its worst recession since independence in 1957. GDP grew 5%,
responding to a dynamic export sector, which grew over 10% and fiscal
stimulus from higher government spending. The large export surplus has
enabled the country to build up its already substantial financial
reserves, to $31 billion at yearend 1999. This stable macroeconomic
environment, in which both inflation and unemployment stand at 3% or
less, has made possible the relaxation of most of the capital controls
imposed by the government in 1998 to counter the impact of the Asian
financial crisis. Government and private forecasters expect Malaysia
to continue this trend in 2000, predicting GDP to grow another 5% to
6%. While Malaysia's immediate economic horizon looks bright, its
long-term prospects are clouded by the lack of reforms in the
corporate sector, particularly those dealing with competitiveness and
high corporate debt.

@Maldives:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
20% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. Almost 400,000 tourists visited the islands
in 1998. Fishing is a second leading sector. The Maldivian Government
began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import
quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently,
it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment.
Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor role in the
economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land
and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be
imported. Industry, which consists mainly of garment production, boat
building, and handicrafts, accounts for about 18% of GDP. Maldivian
authorities worry about the impact of erosion and possible global
warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is one meter or
less above sea level.

Background: The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of
France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after
only a few months, the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by
dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 with a transitional
government, and in 1992 when Mali's first democratic presidential
election was held. Since his reelection in 1997, President KONARE has
continued to push through political and economic reforms and to fight
corruption. In 1999 he indicated he would not run for a third term.

@Mali:Economy

Economy - overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful
implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program
that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign
investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50%
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994, has pushed up
economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold
mining operations in 1996-98, and the government anticipates that Mali
will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.
Annual growth should remain in the 5-6% range in 2000-01, and
inflation should drop under 3%.

about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has
no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade,
manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism; the
state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1999, over 1
million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of $13,800 places
Malta in the ranks of the less affluent EU countries. The island is
divided politically over the question of joining the EU. The sizable
budget deficit remains a key concern.

farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes,
melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to
handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a
small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor
force, remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have
few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. Under the terms
of the Compact of Free Association, the US provides roughly $65
million in annual aid. Negotiations were underway in 1999 for an
extended agreement. Government downsizing, drought, a drop in
construction, and the decline in tourism and foreign investment due to
the Asian financial difficulties caused GDP to fall in 1996-98.

@Martinique:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas,
tourism, and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP
and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has
declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of
rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk
of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of
the work force is employed in the service sector and in
administration.

MAURITANIA

@Mauritania:Introduction

Background: Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Opposition
parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in 1991. Two
multiparty presidential elections since then were widely seen as being
flawed; Mauritania remains, in reality, a one-party state. The country
continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black minority
population and the dominant Maur (Arab-Berber) populace.

@Mauritania:Economy

Economy - overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In
March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint World
Bank-IMF mission on a $54 million enhanced structural adjustment
facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set for 1999-2002.
Privatization remains one of the key issues. Mauritania is unlikely to
meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4%-5%.

attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of
Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent protests over standards of
living in the Creole community have slowed economic growth.

@Mauritius:Economy

Economy - overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has
developed from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a middle
income diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and
tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been of the
order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in
increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much
improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the
cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. A
record-setting drought severely damaged the sugar crop in 1999,
however. The government's development strategy centers on foreign
investment. Mauritius has attracted more than 9,000 offshore entities,
many aimed at commerce in India and South Africa, and investment in
the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Economic
performance in 1991-99 continued strong with solid growth and low
unemployment.

MEXICO

@Mexico:Introduction

Background: The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came
under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence
early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994
threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in
over half a century. The nation continues to make an impressive
recovery. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages,
underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable
income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely
Amerindian population in the impoverished southern states.

@Mexico:Economy

Economy - overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated
by the private sector. The number of state-owned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1999. The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural gas
distribution, and airports. A strong export sector helped to cushion
the economy's decline in 1995 and led the recovery in 1996-99. Private
consumption became the leading driver of growth, accompanied by
increased employment and higher wages. Mexico still needs to overcome
many structural problems as it strives to modernize its economy and
raise living standards. Income distribution is very unequal, with the
top 20% of income earners accounting for 55% of income. Trade with the
US and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA was implemented in 1994.
Mexico is pursuing additional trade agreements with most countries in
Latin America and has signed a free trade deal with the EU to lessen
its dependence on the US. The government is pursuing conservative
economic policies in 2000 to avoid another end-of-term economic
crisis, but it still projects an economic growth rate of 4.5% because
of the strong US economy and high oil prices.

@Moldova:Economy

Economy - overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good
farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy
depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,
and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991. As part of an ambitious reform effort, Moldova introduced a
stable convertible currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing
preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land
privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest rates. Yet
these efforts could not offset the impact of political and economic
difficulties, both internal and regional. In 1998, the economic
troubles of Russia, by far Moldova's leading trade partner, were a
major cause of the 8.6% drop in GDP; the value of the currency in
relation to the dollar fell by half. In 1999, GDP fell again, by 4.4%,
the fifth drop in the past six years; exports were down, and energy
supplies continued erratic. GDP is expected to remain at about the
same level in 2000.

Economy - overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean
coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and
pleasant climate. The Principality has successfully sought to
diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting
industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and
thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and
offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors,
including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.

@Mongolia:Introduction

Background: Long a province of China, Mongolia won its independence in
1921 with Soviet backing. A communist regime was installed in 1924.
During the early 1990s, the ex-communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) gradually yielded its monopoly on power. In
1996, the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) defeated the MPRP in a
national election and has attempted to establish a number of reforms
to modernize the economy. However, many former communists retain key
posts and implementation has been difficult.

@Mongolia:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic activity traditionally has been based on
agriculture and breeding of livestock. Mongolia also has extensive
mineral deposits: copper, coal, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
account for a large part of industrial production. Soviet assistance,
at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in
1990-91, at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. Mongolia was
driven into deep recession, which was prolonged by the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party's (MPRP) reluctance to undertake serious
economic reform. The Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) government has
embraced free-market economics, easing price controls, liberalizing
domestic and international trade, and attempting to restructure the
banking system and the energy sector. Major domestic privatization
programs have been undertaken, as well as fostering of foreign
investment through international tender of the oil distribution
company, a leading cashmere company, and banks. Reform has been held
back by the ex-communist MPRP opposition and by the political
instability brought about through four successive governments under
the DUC. Economic growth picked up in 1997-99 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of
copper and cashmere. Public revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and
1999 due to the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis. In August
and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban
on exports of oil and oil products. Mongolia joined the World Trade
Organization (WTrO) in 1997. The international donor community pledged
over $300 million per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting,
held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999.

@Montserrat:Economy

Economy - overview: Severe volcanic activity, which began in July
1995, put a damper on this small, open economy throughout 1996-99. A
catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the air and sea ports,
causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the
12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998, but
lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector continued
to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the
destruction of crops. Construction was the dominant activity in 1997
and 1998. GDP declined again in 1998. Prospects for the economy depend
largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public
sector construction activity. The UK committed about $100 million in
1996-98 to help reconstruct the economy and has programmed additional
aid for 1999-2001.

@Morocco:Introduction

Background: Morocco's long struggle for independence from France ended
in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier was turned over to the
new country that same year. Morocco virtually annexed Western Sahara
during the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the
territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s
resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997.

@Morocco:Economy

Economy - overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries - restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and achieving sustainable economic
growth. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic
program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World
Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now fully
convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the financial
sector have been implemented; and state enterprises are being
privatized. Drought conditions depressed activity in the key
agricultural sector, and contributed to an economic slowdown in 1999.
Favorable rainfalls have led Morocco to predict a growth of 6% for
2000. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing the external
debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU; and improving
education and attracting foreign investment to improve living
standards and job prospects for Morocco's youthful population.

@Mozambique:Introduction

Background: Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a
close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration by whites,
economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged
civil war hindered the country's development. The ruling party
formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the
following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market
economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement with rebel forces ended the
fighting in 1992.

@Mozambique:Economy

Economy - overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992,
Mozambique's economy was devastated by a protracted civil war and
socialist mismanagement. In 1994, it ranked as one of the poorest
countries in the world. Since then, Mozambique has undertaken a series
of economic reforms. Almost all aspects of the economy have been
liberalized to some extent. More than 900 state enterprises have been
privatized. Pending are tax and much needed commercial code reform, as
well as greater private sector involvement in the transportation,
telecommunications, and energy sectors. Since 1996, inflation has been
low and foreign exchange rates stable. Albeit from a small base,
Mozambique's economy grew at an annual 10% rate in 1997-99, one of the
highest growth rates in the world. Still, the country depends on
foreign assistance to balance the budget and to pay for a trade
imbalance in which imports outnumber exports by five to one or more.
The medium-term outlook for the country looks bright, as trade and
transportation links to South Africa and the rest of the region are
expected to improve and sizable foreign investments materialize. Among
these investments are metal production (aluminum, steel), natural gas,
power generation, agriculture (cotton, sugar), fishing, timber, and
transportation services. Additional exports in these areas should
bring in needed foreign exchange. In addition, Mozambique is on track
to receive a formal cancellation of a large portion of its external
debt through a World Bank initiative.

@Namibia:Introduction

Background: South Africa occupied the German colony of Sud-West Afrika
during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World
War II when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist South-West
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war of
independence for the area that was soon named Namibia, but it was not
until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in
accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. Independence
came in 1990.

@Namibia:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of GDP.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is four times the per
capita GDP of Africa's poorer countries, the majority of Namibia's
people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale unemployment,
the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of
wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to
South Africa. GDP growth should improve in 2000-01, because of gains
in the diamond and fish sectors. Agreement has been reached on the
privatization of several more enterprises in coming years, which
should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

@Nauru:Economy

Economy - overview: Revenues of this tiny island come from exports of
phosphates, but reserves are expected to be exhausted in the year
2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita
incomes in the Third World, with estimates of GDP varying widely. Few
other resources exist, thus most necessities must be imported,
including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land
and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term
problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in
trust funds to help cushion the transition. The government also has
been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance fiscal deficits. To
cut costs the government has called for a freezing of wages, a
reduction of over-staffed public service departments, privatization of
numerous government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.
In recent years Nauru has encouraged the registration of offshore
banks and corporations. Tens of billions of dollars have been
channeled through their accounts.

@Netherlands Antilles:Introduction

Background: Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, the island
of Curacao was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its
prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early

newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. The island of Sint Maarten is
shared with France (whose northern portion is named Saint Martin and
is part of Guadeloupe).

Background: The Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830
Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands
remained neutral in World War I but suffered a brutal invasion and
occupation by Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialized
nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural
products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EC, and
participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999.

@Netherlands:Economy

Economy - overview: The Netherlands is a prosperous and open economy
in which the government has successfully reduced its role since the
1980s. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing,
chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly
mechanized agricultural sector employs no more than 4% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry
and for exports. The Dutch rank third worldwide in value of
agricultural exports, behind the US and France. The Netherlands
successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job
growth long before its European partners. This has helped cushion the
economy from a slowdown in the euro area. Strong 3.8% GDP growth in
1998 was followed by an only slightly lower 3.4% expansion in 1999.
The outlook remains favorable, with real GDP growth in 2000 projected
at 3.25%, along with a small budget surplus. The Dutch were among the
first 11 EU countries establishing the euro currency zone on 1 January
1999.

@New Caledonia:Economy

Economy - overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's
known nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered
because of depressed international demand for nickel, the principal
source of export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is
suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports.
In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France
and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. The situation in
1998 was clouded by the spillover of financial problems in East Asia
and by lower prices for nickel. Nickel prices jumped in 1999, and
large additions were made to capacity.

@New Zealand:Economy

Economy - overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent on
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized, free
market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the technological
capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained inflationary
pressures. Inflation remains among the lowest in the industrial world.
Per capita GDP has been moving up toward the levels of the big West
European economies. New Zealand's heavy dependence on trade leaves its
growth prospects vulnerable to economic performance in Asia, Europe,
and the US. Moderate growth probably will characterize 2000.

NICARAGUA

@Nicaragua:Introduction

Background: Settled as a colony of Spain in the 1520s, Nicaragua
gained its independence in 1821. Violent opposition to governmental
manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted
in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista
guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El
Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas
through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990 and again in 1996
saw the Sandinistas defeated. The country has slowly rebuilt its
economy during the 1990s, but was hard hit by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

@Nicaragua:Economy

Economy - overview: Nicaragua is one of the hemisphere's poorest
countries, with low per capita income, flagging socio-economic
indicators, and huge external debt. The country has made significant
progress toward macro-economic stabilization over the past few years -
even with the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch in the fall of 1998.
International aid, debt relief, and continued foreign investment have
contributed to the stabilization process. GDP grew 6.3% in 1999, while
inflation remained about 12%, and unemployment dropped. Nicaragua may
qualify for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
though aid is conditioned on improving governability, the openness of
government financial operations, poverty alleviation, and human
rights.

@Nigeria:Introduction

Background: Following nearly 16 years of military rule, a new
constitution was adopted in 1999 and a peaceful transition to civilian
government completed. The new president faces the daunting task of
rebuilding a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been
squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and
institutionalizing democracy. In addition, the OBASANJO administration
must defuse longstanding ethnic and religious tensions, if it is to
build a sound foundation for economic growth and political stability.

@Nigeria:Economy

Economy - overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy, long hobbled by
political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic management,
is undergoing substantial economic reform under the new civilian
administration. Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify
the economy away from overdependence on the capital-intensive oil
sector, which provides 20% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings,
and about 65% of budgetary revenues. The largely subsistence
agricultural sector has not kept up with rapid population growth, and
Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must import food. In
2000, Nigeria is likely to receive a debt-restructuring deal with the
Paris club and a $1 billion loan from the IMF, both contingent on
economic reforms. Increased foreign investment combined with high
world oil prices should push growth to over 5% in 2000-01.

NIGER

@Niger:Introduction

Background: Not until 1993, 33 years after independence from France,
did Niger hold its first free and open elections. A 1995 peace accord
ended a five-year Tuareg insurgency in the north. Coups in 1996 and
1999 were followed by the creation of a National Reconciliation
Council that effected a transition to civilian rule in December 1999.

@Niger:Economy

Economy - overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export
since the 1970s. The 50% devaluation of the West African franc in
January 1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the
products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on
bilateral and multilateral aid - which was suspended following the
April 1999 coup d'etat - for operating expenses and public investment.
Short-term prospects depend on upcoming negotiations with the World
Bank and the IMF on debt relief and extended aid.

@Niue:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid and
remittances from New Zealand. Government expenditures regularly exceed
revenues, and the shortfall is made up by grants from New Zealand
which are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut
government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half.
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening,
although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists
primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil,
honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent
years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration
of Niueans to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the
promotion of tourism and a financial services industry.

colony (1788-1814 and 1825-55) were ultimately abandoned. In 1856, the
island was resettled by Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of the Bounty
mutineers and their Tahitian companions.

covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US
was approved in 1975. A new government and constitution went into
effect in 1978.

@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $1 billion to the US in
1998 under duty and quota exemptions.

@Norway:Introduction

Background: Despite its neutrality, Norway was not able to avoid
occupation by Germany in World War II. In 1949, neutrality was
abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas
in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic
fortunes. The current focus is on containing spending on the extensive
welfare system and planning for the time when petroleum reserves are
depleted. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining
the EU.

@Norway:Economy

Economy - overview: The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of
welfare capitalism, featuring a combination of free market activity
and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such
as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises),
and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse
resources. The extensive welfare system helps propel public sector
expenditures to more than 50% of GDP. A major shipping nation, with a
high dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an
exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods. The country is
richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish,
forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil production
and international oil prices. Only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than
Norway. Norway imports more than half its food needs. Oslo opted to
stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994. Growth was a
meager 0.8% in 1999 because of weak private consumption and anemic
investment activity in the oil and other sectors. Growth should pick
up in 2000, perhaps to 2.7%. Despite their high per capita income and
generous welfare benefits, Norwegians worry about that time in the
next two decades when the oil and gas begin to run out.

development of a body of commercial law to facilitate foreign
investment, and increased budgetary outlays. Oman continues to
liberalize its markets in an effort to accede to the World Trade
Organization (WTrO) and is likely to gain membership in 2000.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Pacific
Ocean remains the largest of the world's five oceans (followed by the
Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean).

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between the Southern Ocean, Asia, Australia,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Area:
total: 155.557 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East
China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
Philippine Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: about 15 times the size of the US; covers about
28% of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian landmass back to the ocean;
tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and east Asia from
May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of
Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial
countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary
food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better
feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships subject to
superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May; persistent
fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June to
December

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Geography - note: the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
the southwestern Pacific Ocean

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60% of
the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of
offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in
the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high
cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings
in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new
drillings.

PAKISTAN

@Pakistan:Introduction

Background: The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim
state of Pakistan (with two sections West and East) and largely Hindu
India was never satisfactorily resolved. A third war between these
countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan seceding and becoming the
separate nation of Bangladesh. A dispute over the state of Kashmir is
ongoing. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan
conducted its own tests in 1998.

@Pakistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Pakistan is a poor, heavily populated country,
suffering from internal political disputes, lack of foreign
investment, and a costly confrontation with neighboring India.
Pakistan's economic outlook continues to be marred by its weak foreign
exchange position, notably its continued reliance on international
creditors for hard currency inflows. The MUSHARRAF government faces
$32 billion in external debt and has nearly completed rescheduling
with Paris Club members and other bilateral creditors. Foreign loans
and grants provide approximately 25% of government revenue, but debt
service obligations total nearly 50% of government expenditure. The
IMF has remained silent on future disbursements from its $1.56 billion
bailout package initiated in 1999, and other international financial
institutions are gauging the current administration's resolve to
implement necessary fiscal reforms. MUSHARRAF's ambitious economic
agenda includes measures to widen the tax net, privatize public sector
assets, and improve its balance of trade position. Pakistan has made
privatization a cornerstone of economic revival, but may have
difficulty attracting new investors until it receives positive
endorsement from the World Bank. The Bank has withheld its approval
pending resolution of the pricing dispute between the government and
independent power producers.

PANAMA

@Panama:Introduction

Background: With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and
promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of
a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the
structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the
US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. On 7 September 1977,
an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from
the US to Panama by 1999. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing
responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the intervening
years. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The
entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US
military bases were turned over to Panama on 31 December 1999.

@Panama:Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's
economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce,
and tourism. The hand-over of the canal and military installations by
the US has given rise to new construction projects. The MOSCOSO
administration inherited an economy that is much more structurally
sound and liberalized than the one inherited by its predecessor. Even
though export demand is likely to remain slack in some key markets -
especially the Andean countries - GDP growth in 2000 probably will be
3% to 4%. Key reform initiatives from the previous administration -
including the privatization of public utilities - remain uncompleted.
Although President MOSCOSO is unlikely to overturn any previous
reforms, her populist leanings make it unlikely any new initiatives
will be undertaken in the near future. Indeed, the government has
failed to formulate a comprehensive economic policy framework, and the
only concrete step it has taken by yearend 1999 has been a hike in
agricultural tariffs.

Illicit drugs: major cocaine transshipment point and major
drug-money-laundering center; no recent signs of coca cultivation;
monitoring of financial transactions is improving, yet Panama has
failed to prosecute anyone for money laundering - official corruption
remains a major problem

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

@Papua New Guinea:Introduction

Background: The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second
largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK
(south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902,
which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued
to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A
nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in
1997, after claiming some 20,000 lives.

@Papua New Guinea:Economy

Economy - overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
resources, but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain
and the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a
subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population. Mineral
deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of export
earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under
World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995, Port
Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a structural
adjustment program, of which the first phase was successfully
completed in 1996. In 1997, droughts caused by the El Nino weather
pattern wreaked havoc on Papua New Guinea's coffee, cocoa, and coconut
production, the mainstays of the agricultural-based economy and major
sources of export earnings. The coffee crop was slashed by up to 50%
in 1997. Despite problems with drought, the year 1998 saw a small
recovery in GDP. Growth increased to 3.6% in 1999 and may be even
higher in 2000, say 4.3%.

PARAGUAY

@Paraguay:Introduction

Background: In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70),
Paraguay lost two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory.
It stagnated economically for the next half century. In the Chaco War
of 1932-35, large, economically important areas were won from Bolivia.
The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER was overthrown
in 1989, and relatively free and regular presidential elections have
been held since then.

@Paraguay:Economy

Economy - overview: Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector. The informal sector features both reexport of
imported consumer goods to neighboring countries as well as the
activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors.
Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic
measures are difficult to obtain. A large percentage of the population
derive their living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence
basis. The formal economy grew by an average of about 3% annually in
1995-97, but GDP declined slightly in 1998 and 1999. On a per capita
basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. Most observers
attribute Paraguay's poor economic performance to political
uncertainty, corruption, lack of progress on structural reform, and
deficient infrastructure. Growth should recover in 2000, perhaps to
2%.

Piura, Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali
note: the 1979 constitution mandated the creation of regions
(regiones, singular - region) to function eventually as autonomous
economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
constituted from 23 of the 24 departments - Amazonas (from Loreto),
Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from
Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los
Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui
(from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed
by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge
with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
central government and organizational and political difficulties, the
regions have yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993
constitution retains the regions but limits their authority; the 1993
constitution also reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal

@Peru:Economy

Economy - overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
market-oriented, with major privatizations completed since 1990 in the
mining, electricity, and telecommunications industries. Thanks to
strong foreign investment and the cooperation between the FUJIMORI
government and the IMF and World Bank, growth was strong in 1994-97
and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, El Nino's impact on
agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in
Brazilian markets undercut growth. And 1999 was another lean year for
Peru, with the aftermath of El Nino and the Asian financial crisis
working its way through the economy. Lima did manage to complete
negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999,
although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets. Pressure on
spending is growing in the run-up to the 2000 elections. Nevertheless,
improved commodity prices and the recovery of the fishing sector
should help drive GDP growth above the 5% mark in 2000.

PHILIPPINES

@Philippines:Introduction

Background: The Philippines were ceded by Spain to the US in 1898
following the Spanish-American War. They attained their independence
in 1946 after being occupied by the Japanese in World War II. The
21-year rule of Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986 when a widespread
popular rebellion forced him into exile. In 1992, the US closed down
its last military bases on the islands. A quarter-century-old
guerrilla war with Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao, which
had claimed 120,000 lives, ended with a treaty in 1996.

@Philippines:Economy

Economy - overview: In 1998 the Philippine economy - a mixture of
agriculture, light industry, and supporting services - deteriorated as
a result of spillover from the Asian financial crisis and poor weather
conditions. Growth fell to about -0.5% in 1998 from 5% in 1997, but
recovered to 2.9% in 1999. The government has promised to continue its
economic reforms to help the Philippines match the pace of development
in the newly industrialized countries of East Asia. The strategy
includes improving infrastructure, overhauling the tax system to
bolster government revenues, and moving toward further deregulation
and privatization of the economy.

fertile soil of the valleys produces a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables, including citrus, sugarcane, watermelons, bananas, yams,
and beans. Bartering is an important part of the economy. The major
sources of revenue are the sale of postage stamps to collectors and
the sale of handicrafts to passing ships.

@Poland:Introduction

Background: Poland gained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun
by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet
satellite country following the war, but one that was comparatively
tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation
of an independent trade union "Solidarity" that over time became a
political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the
presidency. Complete freedom came with the implosion of the USSR in
1991. A "shock therapy" program during the early 1990s enabled the
country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in
Central Europe, boosting hopes for early acceptance to the EU. Poland
joined the NATO alliance in 1999.

@Poland:Economy

Economy - overview: Poland today stands out as one of the most
successful and open transition economies. The privatization of small
and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new
firms marked the rapid development of a private sector now responsible
for 70% of economic activity. In contrast to the vibrant expansion of
private non-farm activity, the large agriculture component remains
handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor, inefficient small
farms, and lack of investment. The government's determination to enter
the EU as soon as possible affects most aspects of its economic
policies. Improving Poland's worsening current account deficit and
tightening monetary policy, now focused on inflation targeting, also
are priorities. Warsaw continues to hold the budget deficit to around
2% of GDP. Structural reforms advanced in pensions, health care, and
public administration in 1999, but resulted in larger than anticipated
fiscal pressures. Further progress on public finance depends mainly on
privatization of Poland's remaining state sector. Restructuring and
privatization of "sensitive sectors" (e.g., coal and steel) has begun,
but work remains to be done. Growth in 2000 should be moderately above
1999.

@Portugal:Introduction

Background: Following its heyday as a world power during the 15th and
16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the
destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the
Napoleonic Wars, and the loss of its Brazilian colony in 1822. A 1910
revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades
repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military
coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year Portugal
granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal entered
the EC in 1985.

@Portugal:Economy

Economy - overview: Portugal is an upcoming capitalist economy with a
per capita GDP two-thirds that of the four big West European
economies. In 1999, it continued to enjoy sturdy economic growth,
falling interest rates, and low unemployment. The country qualified
for the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and joined with 10 other
European countries in launching the euro on 1 January 1999. Portugal's
inflation rate for 1999, 2.4%, was comfortably low. The country
continues to run a trade deficit and a balance of payments deficit.
The government is working to modernize capital plant and increase the
country's competitiveness in the increasingly integrated world
markets. Growth is expected to remain stable in 2000 as the economic
integration of Europe proceeds. Improvement in the education sector is
critical to the catch-up process.

@Puerto Rico:Economy

Economy - overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies
in the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has surpassed
agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.
Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US
firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum
wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 5
million tourists in 1999. Prospects for 2000 are good, assuming
continued strength in the tourism and construction sectors and
continuation of the US boom.

QATAR

@Qatar:Introduction

Background: During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy
was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by
the amir who had ruled the country since 1972. He was overthrown in a
bloodless coup by his own son in 1995. Oil and natural gas revenues
enable Qatar to have a per capita income not far below the leading
industrial countries of Western Europe.

@Qatar:Economy

Economy - overview: Oil accounts for more than 30% of GDP, roughly 80%
of export earnings, and 66% of government revenues. Proved oil
reserves of 3.7 billion barrels should ensure continued output at
current levels for 23 years. Oil has given Qatar a per capita GDP
three-fourths that of the leading West European industrial countries.
Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 7 trillion cubic meters,
more than 5% of the world total, third largest in the world.
Production and export of natural gas are becoming increasingly
important. Long-term goals feature the development of off-shore
petroleum and the diversification of the economy. If high oil prices
continue in 2000, Qatar will post its highest ever trade surplus - of
more than $4 billion.

@Reunion:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture. Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a
century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The
government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to
relieve high unemployment, which amounts to more than 40% of the labor
force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The
white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
segments of the population, often approaching European standards,
whereas minority groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of
the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe
rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic
tensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France.

ROMANIA

@Romania:Introduction

Background: Soviet occupation following World War II led to the
formation of a communist Peoples Republic in 1947 and the abdication
of the king. The decades-long rule of President Nicolae CEAUSESCU
became increasingly draconian through the 1980s. He was overthrown and
executed in late 1989. Former communists dominated the government
until 1996 when they were swept from power. Much economic
restructuring remains to be carried out before Romania can achieve its
hope of joining the EU.

@Romania:Economy

Economy - overview: After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1989-91,
Romania was left with an obsolete industrial base and a pattern of
industrial capacity wholly unsuited to its needs. In February 1997,
Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform program, but reform subsequently has been a
frustrating stop-and-go process. Restructuring programs include
liquidating large energy-intensive industries and major agricultural
and financial sector reforms. In 1999 Romania's economy contracted for
a third straight year - by an estimated 4.8%. Romania reached an
agreement with the IMF in August for a $547 million loan, but release
of the second tranche was postponed in October because of unresolved
private sector lending requirements and differences over budgetary
spending. Bucharest avoided defaulting on mid-year lump-sum debt
payments, but had to significantly draw down reserves to do so;
reserves rebounded to an estimated $1.5 billion by yearend 1999. The
government's priorities include: obtaining renewed IMF lending,
tightening fiscal policy, accelerating privatization, and
restructuring unprofitable firms. Romania was invited by the EU in
December 1999 to begin accession negotiations.

@Rwanda:Introduction

Background: In 1959, three years before independence, the majority
ethnic group, the Hutus overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the next
several years thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven
into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles
later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and
began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and
economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions culminating in April
1994 in a genocide in which roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the
genocide in July 1994, but approximately 2 million Hutu refugees -
many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DROC). Since then most of the refugees have returned. Despite
substantial international assistance and political reforms - including
Rwanda's first ever local elections held in March 1999 - the country
continues to struggle to boost investment and agricultural output and
to foster reconciliation. A series of massive population
displacements, a nagging Hutu extremist insurgency, and Rwandan
involvement in two wars over the past four years in the neighboring
DROC continue to hinder Rwanda's efforts.

@Rwanda:Economy

Economy - overview: Rwanda is a rural country with about 90% of the
population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture. It is the most
densely populated country in Africa; is landlocked; and has few
natural resources and minimal industry. Primary exports are coffee and
tea. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base,
severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded
the country's ability to attract private and external investment.
However, Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and
rehabilitating its economy. GDP has rebounded, and inflation has been
curbed. In June 1998, Rwanda signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) with the IMF. Rwanda has also embarked upon an
ambitious privatization program with the World Bank. Continued growth
in 2000 depends on the maintenance of international aid levels and the
strengthening of world prices of coffee and tea.

@Saint Kitts and Nevis:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy has traditionally depended on the
growing and processing of sugarcane; decreasing world prices have hurt
the industry in recent years. Tourism, export-oriented manufacturing,
and offshore banking activity have assumed larger roles. Most food is
imported. The government has undertaken a program designed to
revitalize the faltering sugar sector. It is also working to improve
revenue collection in order to better fund social programs. In 1997
some leaders in Nevis were urging separation from Saint Kitts on the
basis that Nevis was paying far more in taxes than it was receiving in
government services, but the vote on cessation failed in August 1998.
In late September 1998, Hurricane Georges caused approximately $445
million in damages and limited GDP growth for the year.

@Saint Lucia:Economy

Economy - overview: The recent changes in the EU import preference
regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have
made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.
Improvement in the construction sector and growth of the tourism
industry helped expand GDP in 1998-99. The agriculture sector
registered its fifth year of decline in 1997 primarily because of a
severe decline in banana production. The manufacturing sector is the
most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean, and the government is beginning
to develop regulations for the small offshore financial sector.

@Saint Pierre and Miquelon:Economy

Economy - overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off
the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however,
because of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady
decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. In 1992, an
arbitration panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of
12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada,
although it represents only 25% of what France had sought. The islands
are heavily subsidized by France to the great betterment of living
standards. The government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost
economic prospects.

@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines:Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is
the most important sector of this lower-middle-income economy. The
services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also
important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at
introducing new industries, and a high unemployment rate of 22%
continues. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the
biggest obstacle to the islands' development; tropical storms wiped
out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995. The tourism
sector has considerable potential for development over the next
decade. Recent growth has been stimulated by strong activity in the
construction sector and an improvement in tourism. There is a small
manufacturing sector and a small offshore financial sector whose
particularly restrictive secrecy laws have caused some international
concern.

@Sao Tome and Principe:Economy

Economy - overview: This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence 25 years ago.
However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of
drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export
has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao Tome has to
import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a
significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to
service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid
and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential exists for development
of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand
facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to
reduce price controls and subsidies, but economic growth has remained
sluggish. Sao Tome is also optimistic that significant petroleum
discoveries are forthcoming in its territorial waters in the oil-rich
waters of the Gulf of Guinea. Corruption scandals continue to weaken
the economy.

SAUDI ARABIA

@Saudi Arabia:Introduction

Background: In 1902 Abdul al-Aziz Ibn SAUD captured Riyadh and set out
on a 30-year campaign to unify the Arabian peninsula. In the 1930s,
the discovery of oil transformed the country. Following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal
family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to
deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. A
burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely
dependent on petroleum output and prices are all major governmental
concerns.

@Saudi Arabia:Economy

Economy - overview: This is an oil-based economy with strong
government controls over major economic activities. Saudi Arabia has
the largest reserves of petroleum in the world (26% of the proved
total), ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a
leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of
budget revenues, 40% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings. About 35% of
GDP comes from the private sector. Roughly 4 million foreign workers
play an important role in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil
and service sectors. Saudi Arabia was a key player in the successful
efforts of OPEC and other oil producing countries to raise the price
of oil in 1999 to its highest level since the Gulf War by reducing
production. Although oil prices are expected to remain relatively high
in 2000, Riyadh expects to have a $7.5 billion budget deficit in part
because of increased spending for education and other social problems.
The government in 1999 announced plans to begin privatizing the
electricity companies, which follows the ongoing privatization of the
telecommunications company. The government is expected to continue
calling for private sector growth to lessen the kingdom's dependence
on oil and increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi
population. Shortages of water and rapid population growth will
constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in
agricultural products.

@Senegal:Introduction

Background: Independent from France in 1960, Senegal joined with The
Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982.
However, the envisaged integration of the two countries was never
carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks,
a southern separatist group sporadically has clashed with government
forces since 1982. Senegal has a long history of participating in
international peacekeeping.

@Senegal:Economy

Economy - overview: In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and
ambitious economic reform program with the support of the
international donor community. This reform began with a 50%
devaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which is linked at a
fixed rate to the French franc. Government price controls and
subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy
contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks
to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging 5% annually
in 1995-99. Annual inflation has been pushed down to 2%, and the
fiscal deficit has been cut to less than 1.5% of GDP. Investment rose
steadily from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in 1997. As a member of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), Senegal is
working toward greater regional integration with a unified external
tariff. Senegal also realized full Internet connectivity in 1996,
creating a miniboom in information technology-based services. Private
activity now accounts for 82% of GDP. On the negative side, Senegal
faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic unemployment, juvenile
delinquency, and drug addiction. Real GDP growth is expected to rise
above 6%, while inflation is likely to hold at 2% in 2000-2001.

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO

@Serbia and Montenegro:Introduction

Background: Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a
joint independent state, but this entity has not been formally
recognized as a state by the US. The US view is that the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved and that none of
the successor republics represents its continuation. In 1999, massive
expulsions by Serbs of ethnic Albanians living in the autonomous
republic of Kosovo provoked an international response, including the
bombing of Serbia and the stationing of NATO and Russian peacekeepers
in Kosovo.

@Serbia and Montenegro:Economy

Economy - overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in
1991 has been followed by highly destructive warfare, the
destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup of important
interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by
half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had
depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and
manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and
levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of
many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants
lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is
the continuation in office of a government that is primarily
interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform.
Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency unit in
June 1993; prices were relatively stable from 1995 through 1997, but
inflationary pressures resurged in 1998. Reliable statistics continue
to be hard to come by, and the GDP estimate is extremely rough. The
economic boom anticipated by the government after the suspension of UN
sanctions in December 1995 has failed to materialize. Government
mismanagement of the economy is largely to blame, but the damage to
Serbia's infrastructure and industry by the NATO bombing during the
war in Kosovo have added to problems. Also, sanctions continue to
isolate Belgrade from international financial institutions; an
investment ban and asset freeze imposed in 1998 and the oil embargo
imposed during the NATO bombing remain in place.

@Seychelles:Economy

Economy - overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the tourist sector,
which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70%
of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years the
government has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade
hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved
to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of
farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of
the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due
largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry has rebounded, the
government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in
the face of stiff international competition. Other issues facing the
government are the curbing of the budget deficit and further
privatization of public enterprises. Growth slowed in 1998-99, due to
sluggish tourist and tuna sectors.

SIERRA LEONE

@Sierra Leone:Introduction

Background: Since 1991, civil war between the government and the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has resulted in tens of thousands of
deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (well over
one-third of the population) many of whom are now refugees in
neighboring countries. A peace agreement, signed on 7 July 1999,
offers hope that the country will be able to rebuild its devastated
economy and infrastructure, but previous peace efforts have failed. As
of late 1999, up to 6,000 UN peacekeepers were in the process of
deploying to bolster the peace accord.

@Sierra Leone:Economy

Economy - overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral,
agricultural, and fishery resources. However, the economic and social
infrastructure is not well developed, and serious social disorders
continue to hamper economic development. About two-thirds of the
working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture.
Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and
of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Bauxite and rutile
mines have been shut down by civil strife. The major source of hard
currency is found in the mining of diamonds, the large majority of
which are smuggled out of the country. The resurgence of internal
warfare in 1999 brought another substantial drop in GDP. The fate of
the economy in 2000 depends on the mid-1999 peace accord holding and
the rebels reopening territory under their control.

Economy - overview: Singapore is blessed with a highly developed and
successful free-market economy, a remarkably open and corruption-free
business environment, stable prices, and the fifth highest per capita
GDP in the world. Exports, particularly in electronics and chemicals,
and services are the main drivers of the economy. The government
promotes high levels of savings and investment through a mandatory
savings scheme and spends heavily in education and technology. It also
owns government-linked companies (GLCs) - particularly in
manufacturing - that operate as commercial entities and account for
60% of GDP. As Singapore looks to a future increasingly marked by
globalization, the country is positioning itself as the region's
financial and high-tech hub.

@Slovakia:Economy

Economy - overview: Slovakia continues the difficult transition from a
centrally planned economy to a modern market economy. It started 1999
faced with a sharp slowdown in GDP growth, large budget and current
account deficits, fast-growing external debt, and persisting
corruption, but made considerable progress toward achieving
macroeconomic stabilization later in the year. Tough austerity
measures implemented in May cut the overall fiscal deficit from 6% in
1998 to under 4% of GDP, and the current account deficit was halved to
an estimated 5% of GDP. Slovakia was invited by the EU in December to
begin accession negotiations early in 2000. Foreign investor interest,
although rising, has not yet led to actual deals; several credit
rating agencies have upgraded their outlook for the country. However,
Slovakia's fiscal position remains weak; inflation and unemployment
remain high; and the government is only now addressing the structural
problems inherited from the MECIAR period, such as large inefficient
enterprises, an insolvent banking sector and high inter-company debts,
and declining tax and social support payments. Furthermore, the
government faces considerable public discontent over the government's
austerity package, persistent high unemployment - which reached an
all-time high of 20% in December 1999 - rising consumer prices,
reduced social benefits, and declining living standards. Real GDP is
forecast to stagnate in 2000; inflationary pressures will remain
strong due to further price liberalization; and little scope exists
for further fiscal consolidation in the 2000 budget, which is based on
rosier assumptions than nearly all private forecasts.

@Solomon Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: The bulk of the population depend on agriculture,
fishing, and forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Most
manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The
islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc,
nickel, and gold. Economic troubles in Southeast Asia led to a steep
downturn in the timber industry, and economic output declined by about
10% in 1998. The government instituted public service pay cuts and
other retrenchments. The economy partially recovered in 1999 on the
strength of rising international gold prices and the first full year
of the Gold Ridge mining operation. However, the closure of the
country's major palm oil plantation in mid-year cast a shadow over
future prospects.

SOMALIA

@Somalia:Introduction

Background: Intermittent civil war has been a fact of life in Somalia
since 1977. In 1991, the northern portion of the country declared its
independence as Somaliland; although de facto independent and
relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south, it has not been
recognized by any foreign government. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN
humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate
famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered
significant casualties, order still had not been restored.

Government - note: While chaos and clan fighting continue in most of
Somalia, some orderly government has been established in the northern
part. In May 1991, the elders of clans in former British Somaliland
established the independent Republic of Somaliland, which, although
not recognized by any government, maintains a stable existence, aided
by the overwhelming dominance of the ruling clan and the economic
infrastructure left behind by British, Russian, and American military
assistance programs. Neighboring Puntland has also made strides
towards reconstructing legitimate, representative government. In
February 1996, the EU agreed to finance the reconstruction of the port
of Berbera; since then, other aid projects have been assumed by the EU
and by a non-governmental Italian organization.

@Somalia:Economy

Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed
countries, Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy
has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most
important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and
about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-nomads, who are
dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion
of the population. After livestock, bananas are the principal export;
sugar, sorghum, corn, and fish are products for the domestic market.
The small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural
products, accounts for 10% of GDP; most facilities have been shut down
because of the civil strife. Moreover, in 1999, ongoing civil
disturbances in Mogadishu and outlying areas interfered with any
substantial economic advance and with international aid arrangements.

SOUTH AFRICA

@South Africa:Introduction

Background: After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in
1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found
their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886)
spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the
native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments, but were
defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902). The resulting Union of South
Africa operated under a policy of apartheid - the separate development
of the races. The 1990s brought an end to apartheid politically and
ushered in black majority rule.

@South Africa:Economy

Economy - overview: South Africa is a middle-income, developing
country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed
financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a
stock exchange that ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a
modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to
major urban centers throughout the region. However, growth has not
been strong enough to cut into the 30% unemployment, and daunting
economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially the
problems of poverty and lack of economic empowerment among the
disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime, corruption, and
HIV/AIDS. At the start of 2000, President MBEKI vowed to promote
economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labor
laws, stepping up the pace of privatization, and cutting unneeded
governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from
organized labor.

SOUTHERN OCEAN

@Southern Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Southern
Ocean is now the fourth-largest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean but larger than the
Arctic Ocean).

@Southern Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and
Antarctica

Geographic coordinates: 65 00 S, 0 00 E (nominally), but the Southern
Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of
water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica; this ring of
water lies between 60 degrees south latitude and the coast of
Antarctica, and encompasses 360 degrees of longitude

Map references: Antarctic Region

Area:
total: 20.327 million sq km
note: includes Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, part of the Drake
Passage, Ross Sea, a small part of the Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and
other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly more than twice the size of the US

Coastline: 17,968 km

Climate: sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Centigrade to -2
degrees Centigrade; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the
continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature
contrast between ice and open ocean; the ocean area from about
latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average
winds found anywhere on Earth; in winter the ocean freezes outward to
65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south
latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well
below 0 degrees Centigrade; at some coastal points intense persistent
drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free
throughout the winter

Terrain: the Southern Ocean is deep, 4,000 to 5,000 meters over most
of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water; the antarctic
continental shelf is generally narrow and unusually deep - its edge
lying at depths of 400 to 800 meters (the global mean is 133 meters);
the Antarctic ice pack grows from an average minimum of 2.6 million
square kilometers in March to about 18.8 million square kilometers in
September, better than a sevenfold increase in area; the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (21,000 km in length) moves perpetually eastward;
it is the world's largest ocean current, transporting 130 million
cubic meters of water per second - 100 times the flow of all the
world's rivers

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: -7,235 m at the southern end of the South Sandwich
Trench
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: probable large and possible giant oil and gas
fields on the continental margin, manganese nodules, possible placer
deposits, sand and gravel, fresh water as icebergs, squid, whales, and
seals - none exploited; krill, fishes

Natural hazards: huge icebergs with drafts up to several hundred
meters; smaller bergs and iceberg fragments; sea ice (generally 0.5 to
1 meter thick) with sometimes dynamic short-term variations and with
large annual and interannual variations; deep continental shelf
floored by glacial deposits varying widely over short distances; high
winds and large waves much of the year; ship icing, especially
May-October; most of region is remote from sources of search and
rescue

Environment - current issues: increased solar ultraviolet radiation
resulting from the antarctic ozone hole in recent years, reducing
marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and
damaging the DNA of some fish; illegal, unreported, and unregulated
fishing in recent years, especially the landing of an estimated five
to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery,
which is likely to affect the sustainability of the stock; large
amount of incidental mortality of seabirds resulting from long-line
fishing for toothfish
note: the now-protected fur seal population is making a strong
comeback after severe overexploitation in the 18th and 19th centuries

Environment - international agreements: the Southern Ocean is subject
to all international agreements regarding the world's oceans; in
addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:
International Whaling Commission (prohibits commercial whaling south
of 40 degrees south [south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and
130 degrees west]); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals
(limits sealing); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (regulates fishing)
note: many nations (including the US) prohibit mineral resource
exploration and exploitation south of the fluctuating Polar Front
(Antarctic Convergence) which is in the middle of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very
cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the
north

Geography - note: the major chokepoint is the Drake Passage between
South America and Antarctica; the Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence)
is the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern
Ocean; it is a distinct region at the middle of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current that separates the very cold polar surface waters
to the south from the warmer waters to the north; the Front and the
Current extend entirely around Antarctica, reaching south of 60
degrees south near New Zealand and near 48 degrees south in the far
South Atlantic coinciding with the path of the maximum westerly winds

@Southern Ocean:Government

Data code: none; the US Government has not approved a standard for
hydrographic codes - see the Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data
Codes appendix

@Southern Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: Fisheries in 1998-1999 (1 July to 30 June) landed
119,898 metric tons, of which 85% was krill and 14% Patagonian
toothfish. International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to
reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the
1998-1999 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish
than the regulated fishery. In the 1998-1999 antarctic summer 10,013
tourists, most of them seaborne, visited the Southern Ocean and
Antarctica, compared to 9,604 the previous year. Nearly 16,000
tourists are expected during the 1999-2000 season.

@Southern Ocean:Transportation

Ports and harbors: McMurdo, Palmer, and offshore anchorages in
Antarctica
note: few ports or harbors exist on the southern side of the Southern
Ocean; ice conditions limit use of most of them to short periods in
midsummer; even then some cannot be entered without icebreaker escort;
most antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and,
except in an emergency, are not open to commercial or private vessels;
vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to
inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers

Transportation - note: Drake Passage offers alternative to transit
through the Panama Canal

@Southern Ocean:Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see
Antarctic Treaty Summary in the Antarctica entry); sections (some
overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New
Zealand, Norway, and UK; the US and most other nations do not
recognize the maritime claims of other nations and have made no claims
themselves (the US reserves the right to do so); no formal claims have
been made in the sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west

SPAIN

@Spain:Introduction

Background: Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th
centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England.
Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial
revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and
Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in
World Wars I and II, but suffered through a devastating Civil War
(1936-39). In the second half of the 20th century, it has played a
catch-up role in the western international community. Continuing
concerns are large-scale unemployment and the Basque separatist
movement.

@Spain:Economy

Economy - overview: Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP
that on a per capita basis is three-fourths that of the four leading
West European economies. Its center-right government successfully
worked to gain admission to the first group of countries launching the
European single currency on 1 January 1999. The AZNAR administration
has continued to advocate liberalization, privatization, and
deregulation of the economy and has introduced some tax reforms to
that end. Unemployment, nonetheless, remains the highest in the EU at
16%. The government, for political reasons, has made only limited
progress in changing labor laws or reforming pension schemes, which
are key to the sustainability of both Spain's internal economic
advances and its competitiveness in a single currency area. Adjustment
to the monetary and other economic policies of an integrated Europe -
and reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment - will pose
difficult challenges to Spain in the next few years.

@Sri Lanka:Economy

Economy - overview: In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic
policies and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented
policies and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic
industries now are food processing, textiles and apparel, food and
beverages, telecommunications, and insurance and banking. By 1996
plantation crops made up only 20% of exports (compared with 93% in
1970), while textiles and garments accounted for 63%. GDP grew at an
annual average rate of 5.5% throughout the 1990s until a drought and a
deteriorating security situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The
economy rebounded in 1997-98 with growth of 6.4% and 4.7% - but slowed
to 3.7% in 1999. For the next round of reforms, the central bank of
Sri Lanka recommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in
nonplantation agriculture, dismantle the government's monopoly on
wheat imports, and promote more competition in the financial sector. A
continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the
Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, which has cost 50,000 lives in the
past 15 years.

@Sudan:Economy

Economy - overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political
instability, adverse weather, weak world commodity prices, a drop in
remittances from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. The
private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading,
with most private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture
employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural
items. Sluggish economic performance over the past decade,
attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita
income at low levels. A large foreign debt and huge arrears continue
to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its
nonpayment of arrears to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised
reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund.
To avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make token payments on its
arrears to the Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies,
measures it has partially implemented. The government's continued
prosecution of the civil war and its growing international isolation
continued to inhibit growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the
economy during 1999. The government has worked with foreign partners
to develop the oil sector, and the country is producing approximately
150,000 barrels per day.

@Suriname:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry,
which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.
After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the WIJDENBOSCH government
ended the structural adjustment program of the previous government,
claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of society. Tax revenues
fell as old taxes lapsed and the government failed to implement new
tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the allocation of new Dutch
development funds was frozen as Surinamese Government relations with
the Netherlands deteriorated. Economic growth slowed in 1998, with
decline in the mining, construction, and utility sectors. Rampant
government expenditures, poor tax collection, a bloated civil service,
and reduced foreign aid in 1999 contributed to the fiscal deficit,
estimated at 11% of GDP. The government sought to cover this deficit
through monetary expansion, which led to a dramatic increase in
inflation and exchange rate depreciation. Suriname's economic
prospects for the medium term will depend on renewed commitment to
responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of
structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.

@Svalbard:Economy

Economy - overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on
Svalbard. The treaty of 9 February 1920 gives the 41 signatories equal
rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation.
Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the
past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The
settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian
state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian
population on the island, runs many of the local services, and
provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping
of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

@Swaziland:Economy

Economy - overview: In this small landlocked economy, subsistence
agriculture occupies more than 60% of the population. Manufacturing
features a number of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined in
importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted
by 1978, and health concerns have cut world demand for asbestos.
Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar, and wood pulp are the main
earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a
short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South
Africa from which it receives four-fifths of its imports and to which
it sends three-fourths of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers
in South African mines supplement domestically earned income by as
much as 20%. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for
foreign investment. Overgrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist
as problems for the future.

SWEDEN

@Sweden:Introduction

Background: A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not
participated in any war in almost two centuries. An armed neutrality
was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's long-successful economic
formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare
elements has recently been undermined by high unemployment, rising
maintenance costs, and a declining position in world markets.
Indecision over the country's role in the political and economic
integration of Europe caused Sweden not to join the EU until 1995, and
to forgo the introduction of the euro in 1999.

@Sweden:Economy

Economy - overview: Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole
twentieth century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living
under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and
external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account
for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only
2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however, this
extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary
difficulties, inflation, high unemployment, and a gradual loss of
competitiveness in international markets. Sweden has harmonized its
economic policies with those of the EU, which it joined at the start
of 1995. Sweden decided not to join the euro system at its outset in
January 1999 but plans to hold a referendum in 2000 on whether to
join. GDP growth is forecast for 4% in 2000, buttressed by solid
consumer confidence.

@Switzerland:Economy

Economy - overview: Switzerland, a prosperous and stable modern market
economy with a per capita GDP 20% above that of the big western
European economies, experienced slower growth in 1999, because of weak
foreign and domestic demand. Growth, however, is expected to rebound
to over 2% in 2000. The Swiss in recent years have brought their
economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance
their international competitiveness. Although the Swiss are not
pursuing EU membership in the near term, in 1999 Bern and Brussels
signed agreements to further liberalize trade ties. These agreements
still have to pass a Swiss referendum in spring 2000, however.
Switzerland is still considered a safe haven for investors, because it
has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's
long-term external value.

@Syria:Economy

Economy - overview: Syria's predominantly statist economy is on a
shaky footing because of Damascus's failure to implement extensive
economic reform. The dominant agricultural sector remains
underdeveloped, with roughly 80% of agricultural land still dependent
on rain-fed sources. Although Syria has sufficient water supplies in
the aggregate at normal levels of precipitation, the great distance
between major water supplies and population centers poses serious
distribution problems. The water problem is exacerbated by rapid
population growth, industrial expansion, and increased water
pollution. Private investment is critical to the modernization of the
agricultural, energy, and export sectors. Oil production is leveling
off, and the efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate international
markets have fallen short. Syria's inadequate infrastructure, outmoded
technological base, and weak educational system make it vulnerable to
future shocks and hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and
Israel.

@Taiwan:Introduction

Background: In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to
Japan, however it reverted to Chinese control after World War II.
Following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million
Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government that over
five decades has gradually democratized and incorporated the native
population within its structure. Throughout this period, the island
has prospered to become one of East Asia's economic "Tigers." The
dominant political issue continues to be the relationship between
Taiwan and China and the question of eventual reunification.

@Taiwan:Economy

Economy - overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with
gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign trade by
government authorities. In keeping with this trend, some large
government-owned banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real
growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the past three decades.
Exports have grown even faster and have provided the primary impetus
for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are low; the trade
surplus is substantial; and foreign reserves are the world's third
largest. Agriculture contributes 3% to GDP, down from 35% in 1952.
Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being moved
off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of
labor markets has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and
illegal. Because of its conservative financial approach and its
entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many
of its neighbors from the Asian financial crisis in 1998-99. Growth in
2000 should pick up a bit from 1999, backed by expansion in domestic
consumption, exports, and private investment.

@Tajikistan:Introduction

Background: Tajikistan has experienced three changes in government and
a civil war since it gained independence in 1991 when the USSR
collapsed. A peace agreement among rival factions was signed in 1997,
but implementation has progressed slowly. Nevertheless, a number of
opposition political parties have been legalized and are participating
in elections, suggesting that the country may be stabilizing
politically. Russian-led peacekeeping troops are based throughout the
country, and Russian-commanded border guards are stationed along the
border with Afghanistan.

@Tajikistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Tajikistan has the lowest per capita GDP among the
15 former Soviet republics. Cotton is the most important crop. Mineral
resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold,
uranium, and tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum
plant, hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in
light industry and food processing. The Tajikistani economy has been
gravely weakened by six years of civil conflict and by the loss of
subsidies from Moscow and of markets for its products. Tajikistan thus
depends on aid from Russia and Uzbekistan and on international
humanitarian assistance for much of its basic subsistence needs. Even
if the peace agreement of June 1997 is honored, the country faces
major problems in integrating refugees and former combatants into the
economy. The future of Tajikistan's economy and the potential for
attracting foreign investment depend upon stability and continued
progress in the peace process.

@Tanzania:Economy

Economy - overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the
world. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts
for half of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
crops to only 4% of the land area. Industry is mainly limited to
processing agricultural products and light consumer goods. The World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have
provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic
infrastructure. Growth in 1991-99 has featured a pickup in industrial
production and a substantial increase in output of minerals, led by
gold. Natural gas exploration in the Rufiji Delta looks promising and
production could start by 2002. Recent banking reforms have helped
increase private sector growth and investment. Short-term economic
progress also depends on curbing corruption.

@Thailand:Economy

Economy - overview: After enjoying the world's highest growth rate
from 1985 to 1995 - averaging almost 9% annually - increased
speculative pressure on Thailand's currency in 1997 led to a crisis
that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the government
to float the baht. Long pegged at 25 to the dollar, the baht reached
its lowest point of 56 to the dollar in January 1998 and the economy
contracted by nearly 10% that same year. Thailand entered a recovery
stage in 1999; preliminary estimates are that the economy expanded by
about 4% - most forecasters expect similar growth in 2000. Beginning
in 1999 the baht stabilized and inflation and interest rates began
coming down. The CHUAN government has cooperated closely with the IMF
and adhered to its mandated recovery program, including passage of new
bankruptcy and foreclosure laws. The regional recovery boosted
exports, while fiscal stimulus buoyed domestic demand. While slow
progress has been made in recapitalizing the financial sector, tough
measures - such as implementing a privatization plan and forcing the
private sector to restructure - remain undone.

@Togo:Economy

Economy - overview: This small sub-Saharan economy is heavily
dependent on both commercial and subsistence agriculture, which
provides employment for 65% of the labor force. Cocoa, coffee, and
cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is
self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal, with
occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector,
phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it
has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased
foreign competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade
center. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World
Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage
foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has
stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes
throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the
tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity. The 12 January 1994
devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to
renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the
end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress
depends on following through on privatization, increased openness in
government financial operations (to accommodate increased social
service outlays), and possible downsizing of the military, on which
the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with
depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with
growth resuming in 1999. Assuming no deterioration of the political
atmosphere, growth should rise to 5% a year in 2000-01.

@Tokelau:Economy

Economy - overview: Tokelau's small size (three villages), isolation,
and lack of resources greatly restrain economic development and
confine agriculture to the subsistence level. The people must rely on
aid from New Zealand to maintain public services, annual aid being
substantially greater than GDP. The principal sources of revenue come
from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.
Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.

Economy - overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which
contributes 30% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans
are the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of
total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food,
mainly from New Zealand. The industrial sector accounts for only 10%
of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings. The
country remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to
offset its trade deficit. The government is emphasizing the
development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of
investment.

@Tunisia:Economy

Economy - overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important
agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors.
Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has
gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization,
simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt.
Real growth averaged 5.0% in the 1990s, and inflation is slowing.
Growth in tourism and increased trade have been key elements in this
steady growth. Tunisia's association agreement with the European Union
entered into force on 1 March 1998, the first such accord between the
EU and Mediterranean countries to be activated. Under the agreement
Tunisia will gradually remove barriers to trade with the EU over the
next decade. Broader privatization, further liberalization of the
investment code to increase foreign investment, and improvements in
government efficiency are among the challenges for the future.

TURKEY

@Turkey:Introduction

Background: Turkey was created in 1923 from the Turkish remnants of
the Ottoman Empire. Soon thereafter the country instituted secular
laws to replace traditional religious fiats. In 1945 Turkey joined the
UN and in 1949 it became a member of NATO. Turkey occupied the
northern portion of Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the
island; relations between the two countries remain strained. Periodic
military offensives against Kurdish terrorists have dislocated part of
the population in southeast Turkey and have drawn international
condemnation.

@Turkey:Economy

Economy - overview: Turkey has a dynamic economy that is a complex mix
of modern industry and commerce along with traditional village
agriculture and crafts. It has a strong and rapidly growing private
sector, yet the state still plays a major role in basic industry,
banking, transport, and communication. Its most important industry -
and largest exporter - is textiles and clothing, which is almost
entirely in private hands. The economic situation in recent years has
been marked by erratic economic growth and serious imbalances. After a
sharp drop in 1994, real GNP averaged 6.5% annual growth in 1995-98;
it then fell about 5% in 1999 as Turkey was adversely affected by
Russia's economic crisis and two major earthquakes. The already-large
public sector fiscal deficit widened in 1999 to perhaps 14% of GDP -
due in large part to the huge burden of interest payments which
accounted for 42% of central grovernment spending. Despite the
implementation in January 1996 of a customs union with the EU, foreign
direct investment in the country remains low - less than $1 billion
annually - perhaps because potential investors are concerned about
economic and political stability. Prospects for the future are
brighter - including prospects for foreign investment - because the
ECEVIT government is implementing a major economic reform program,
including a tighter budget, social security reform, banking
reorganization, and greatly accelerated privatization.

@Turkey:Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: complex maritime, air, and territorial
disputes with Greece in Aegean Sea; Cyprus question with Greece;
dispute with downstream riparian states (Syria and Iraq) over water
development plans for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; traditional
demands regarding former Armenian lands in Turkey have subsided

Illicit drugs: key transit route for Southwest Asian heroin to Western
Europe and - to a far lesser extent the US - via air, land, and sea
routes; major Turkish, Iranian, and other international trafficking
organizations operate out of Istanbul; laboratories to convert
imported morphine base into heroin are in remote regions of Turkey as
well as near Istanbul; government maintains strict controls over areas
of legal opium poppy cultivation and output of poppy straw concentrate

TURKMENISTAN

@Turkmenistan:Introduction

Background: Annexed by Russia between 1865 and 1885, Turkmenistan
became a Soviet republic in 1925. It achieved its independence upon
the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. President NIYAZOV retains
absolute control over the country and opposition is not tolerated.
Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this
underdeveloped country if extraction and delivery projects can be
worked out.

@Turkmenistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Turkmenistan is largely desert country with
nomadic cattle raising, intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and
huge gas and oil resources. One-half of its irrigated land is planted
in cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It also
possesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and
substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had
experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states
because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and
gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's
refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting
debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the
budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. With an
authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally based social
structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic
reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient
economy. Privatization goals remain limited. Turkmenistan is working
hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and Turkey to
Europe, but these will take many years to realize. In 1998-99,
Turkmenistan faced revenue shortfalls due to the continued lack of
adequate export routes for natural gas and obligations on extensive
short-term external debt. Prospects in the near future are
discouraging because of widespread internal poverty and the burden of
foreign debt. IMF assistance would seem to be necessary, yet the
government is not as yet ready to accept IMF requirements.
Turkmenistan's 1999 deal to ship 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) of
natural gas through Russia's Gazprom will help alleviate the 2000
fiscal shortfall, but will not make up for the absence of meaningful
progress in economic reform.

TUVALU

@Tuvalu:Introduction

Background: In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of
the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice
Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert
Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate
British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000,
Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv"
for $50 million in royalties over the next dozen years.

@Tuvalu:Geography

Location: Oceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the
South Pacific Ocean, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to
Australia

Land boundaries: 0 km

Coastline: 24 km

Maritime claims:
contiguous zone: 24 nm
exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
territorial sea: 12 nm

Climate: tropical; moderated by easterly trade winds (March to
November); westerly gales and heavy rain (November to March)

Terrain: very low-lying and narrow coral atolls

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m
highest point: unnamed location 5 m

Natural resources: fish

permanent crops: 0%
permanent pastures: 0%
forests and woodland: 0%
other: 100% (1993 est.)

Irrigated land: NA sq km

Natural hazards: severe tropical storms are usually rare, but, in
1997, there were three cyclones; low-level of islands make them very
sensitive to sea-level rise

Environment - current issues: since there are no streams or rivers and
groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment
systems with storage facilities (the Japanese Government has built one
desalination plant and plans to build one other); beachhead erosion
because of the use of sand for building materials; excessive clearance
of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the
spread of the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is very concerned about
global increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on
rising sea levels, which threaten the country's underground water
table

@Tuvalu:Economy

Economy - overview: Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered
group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known
mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are
the primary economic activities. Government revenues largely come from
the sale of stamps and coins and worker remittances. About 1,000
Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate mining industry. Nauru has
begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as phosphate resources decline.
Substantial income is received annually from an international trust
fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported
also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and
conservative withdrawals, this Fund has grown from an initial $17
million to over $35 million in 1999. The US government is also a major
revenue source for Tuvalu, with 1999 payments from a 1988 treaty on
fisheries at about $9 million, a total which is expected to rise
annually. In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the
government is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization
of some government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%. In 1998,
Tuvalu began deriving revenue from use of its area code for "900"
lines and from the sale of its ".tv" Internet domain name. Royalites
from these new technology sources could raise GDP three or more times
over the next decade. Low-lying Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable to
any rise in the sea level from future global warming.

@Uganda:Economy

Economy - overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources,
including fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral
deposits of copper and cobalt. Agriculture is the most important
sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is
the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues.
Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and
international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the
economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on
export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving
civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at
dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. In
1990-99, the economy turned in a solid performance based on continued
investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved
incentives for production and exports, reduced inflation, gradually
improved domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan
entrepreneurs. Ongoing Ugandan involvement in the war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, growing corruption within the
government, and slippage in the government's determination to press
reforms raise doubts about the continuation of strong growth.

UKRAINE

@Ukraine:Introduction

Background: Richly endowed in natural resources, Ukraine has been
fought over and subjugated for centuries; its 20th-century struggle
for liberty is not yet complete. A short-lived independence from
Russia (1917-1920) was followed by brutal Soviet rule that engineered
two artificial famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million
died, and World War II, in which German and Soviet armies were
responsible for some 7 million more deaths. Although independence was
attained in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, true freedom
remains elusive as many of the former Soviet elite remain entrenched,
stalling efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civic
liberties.

@Ukraine:Economy

Economy - overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and
away the most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic.
Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of
meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to
industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR.
Ukraine depends on imports of energy, especially natural gas. Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian
Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for
privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the
government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to
some backtracking. Output in 1992-99 fell to less than 40% the 1991
level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA
has pushed economic reforms, maintained financial discipline, and
tried to remove almost all remaining controls over prices and foreign
trade. The onset of the financial crisis in Russia dashed Ukraine's
hopes for its first year of economic growth in 1998 due to a sharp
fall in export revenue and reduced domestic demand. Output continued
to drop, slightly, in 1999. The government has also not been able to
significantly decrease its huge backlog of wage and pension arrears.
Despite increasing pressure from the IMF to accelerate reform,
substantial economic restructuring remains unlikely in 2000, largely
because of resistance in the communist-dominated legislature to
further privatization.

Telephone system: Ukraine's telecommunication development plan,
running through 2005, emphasizes improving domestic trunk lines and
international connections, and developing a mobile cellular system
domestic: at independence in December 1991, Ukraine inherited a
telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient and in disrepair;
more than 3.5 million applications for telephones could not be
satisfied; telephone density is now rising slowly and the domestic
trunk system is being improved; from a small base, the mobile cellular
telephone system is expanding at a high rate
international: two new domestic trunk lines are a part of the
fiber-optic Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) system and three Ukrainian links
have been installed in the fiber-optic Trans-European Lines (TEL)
project which connects 18 countries; additional international service
is provided by the Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia (ITUR) fiber-optic

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

@United Arab Emirates:Introduction

Background: The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the
UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century
treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman, Al
Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form
the UAE. They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per
capita GDP is not far below the GDPs of the leading West European
nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and its moderate foreign
policy stance have allowed it to play a vital role in the affairs of
the region.

@United Arab Emirates:Economy

Economy - overview: The UAE has an open economy with a high per capita
income and a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is based on oil
and gas output (about 33% of GDP), and the fortunes of the economy
fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE
has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of
small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of
living. At present levels of production, oil and gas reserves should
last for over 100 years. Despite higher oil revenues in 1999, the
government has not drawn back from the economic reforms implemented
during the 1998 oil price depression. The government has increased
spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening
up its utilities to greater private-sector involvement.

Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in
Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); claims
island in the Persian Gulf jointly administered with Iran (called Abu
Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran) -
over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since
1992, including access restrictions and a military build-up on the
island; the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the
region in protesting these Iranian actions

UNITED KINGDOM

@United Kingdom:Introduction

Background: Great Britain, the dominant industrial and maritime power
of the 19th century, played a leading role in developing parliamentary
democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the
British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The
first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously
depleted in two World Wars. The second half witnessed the dismantling
of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and
prosperous European nation. The UK currently is weighing the degree of
its integration with continental Europe. A member of the EU, it chose
to remain outside of the EMU for the time being. Constitutional reform
is also a significant issue in the UK. Regional assemblies with
varying degrees of power opened in Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland in 1999.

Economy - overview: The UK, a leading trading power and financial
center, deploys an essentially capitalistic economy, one of the
quartet of trillion dollar economies of Western Europe. Over the past
two decades the government has greatly reduced public ownership and
contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The
UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy
production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
while industry continues to decline in importance. Economic growth has
been slowed in 1999; recovery to 3% is in prospect for 2000, based on
a rise in exports and domestic demand. The BLAIR government has put
off the question of participation in the euro system until after the
next election, not expected until 2001; Chancellor of the Exchequer
BROWN has identified some key economic tests to determine whether the
UK should join the common currency system.

UNITED STATES

@United States:Introduction

Background: The United States became the world's first modern
democracy after its break with Great Britain (1776) and the adoption
of a constitution (1789). During the 19th century, many new states
were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North
American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The
two major traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil
War (1861-65) and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Buoyed by
victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991,
the US remains the world's most powerful nation-state. The economy is
marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid
advances in technology.

@United States:Economy

Economy - overview: The US has the most technologically powerful,
diverse, advanced, and largest economy in the world, with a per capita
GDP of $33,900. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals
and business firms make most of the decisions, and government buys
needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US
business firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their
counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand
capital plant, lay off surplus workers, and develop new products. At
the same time, they face higher barriers to entry in their rivals'
home markets than the barriers to entry of foreign firms in US
markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological
advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and
military equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the
end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the
gradual development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the
bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of
those at the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health
insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all
the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households.
The years 1994-99 witnessed solid increases in real output, low
inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below 5%. Long-term
problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure,
rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population, sizable trade
deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic
groups. The outlook for 2000 is clouded by the continued economic
problems of Japan, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and many other
countries. Domestically, the potentially most serious problem is the
exuberant level of stock prices in relation to corporate earnings.

URUGUAY

@Uruguay:Introduction

Background: A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement, the Tupamaros,
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to agree to
military control of his administration in 1973. By the end of the year
the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its
hold throughout the government. Civilian rule was not restored until
1985. Uruguay has long had one of South America's highest standards of
living; its political and labor conditions are among the freest on the
continent.

@Uruguay:Economy

Economy - overview: Uruguay's economy is characterized by an
export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce,
relatively even income distribution, and high levels of social
spending. After averaging growth of 5% annually in 1996-98, in 1999
the economy suffered from lower demand in Argentina and Brazil, which
together account for about half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the
severity of the trade shocks and ensuing recession, Uruguay's
financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbors,
a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its
investment-grade sovereign bond rating - one of only two in Latin
America. Challenges for the government of incoming President Jorge
BATLLE include expanding Uruguay's trade ties beyond its Mercosur
trade partners and bolstering Uruguay's competitiveness by increasing
labor market flexibility and reducing the costs of public services.
Growth should recover in 2000, to perhaps 3%.

UZBEKISTAN

@Uzbekistan:Introduction

Background: Russia conquered Uzbekistan in the late 19th century.
Stiff resistance to the Red Army after World War I was eventually
suppressed and a socialist republic set up in 1925. During the Soviet
era, intensive production of "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to
overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which
have left the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half
dry. Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its
dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum
reserves. Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militant
groups from Tajikistan and Afghanistan, a non-convertible currency,
and the curtailment of human rights and democratization.

@Uzbekistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which
10% consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was
one of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60%
of its population living in densely populated rural communities.
Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major
producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in
December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government
began to reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter monetary policies,
expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role of the state in
the economy, and improving the environment for foreign investors. The
state continues to be a dominating influence in the economy, and
reforms have so far failed to bring about much-needed structural
changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's $185 million standby
arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental steps that made
impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions. Uzbekistan has responded to
the negative external conditions generated by the Asian and Russian
financial crises by tightening export and currency controls within its
already largely closed economy. Economic policies that have repelled
foreign investment are a major factor in the economy's stagnation. A
growing debt burden, persistent inflation, and a poor business climate
cloud growth prospects in 2000.

@Vanuatu:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with
about 50,000 visitors in 1997, are other mainstays of the economy.
Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum
deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market.
Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is
hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports,
vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main
markets and between constituent islands. The most recent natural
disaster, a severe earthquake in November 1999 followed by a tsunami,
caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecote and left
thousands homeless.

@Venezuela:Introduction

Background: Venezuela was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Colombia and
Ecuador). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela
was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the
oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically
elected governments have held sway since 1959. Current concerns
include: drug-related conflicts along the Colombian border, increasing
internal drug consumption, overdependence on the petroleum industry
with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations which
are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.

@Venezuela:Economy

Economy - overview: Venezuelan officials estimate the economy
contracted 7.2% in 1999. A steep downturn in international oil prices
during the first half of the year fueled the recession, and spurred
the CHAVEZ administration to abide by OPEC-led production cuts in an
effort to raise world oil prices. The petroleum sector dominates the
economy, accounting for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of export
earnings, and more than half of government operating revenues. Higher
oil prices during the second half 1999 took pressure off the budget
and currency; the bolivar is widely believed to be overvalued by as
much as 50%. Despite higher oil prices, the economy remains in the
doldrums, possibly due to investor uncertainty over President CHAVEZ's
reform agenda. Implementing legislation for the new constitution will
not be passed until the second half of 2000, after a new legislature
is elected. With the president's economic cabinet attempting to
reconcile a wide range of views, the country's economic reform program
has largely stalled. The government is seeking international
assistance to finance reconstruction after massive flooding and
landslides in December 1999 caused an estimated $15 billion to $20
billion in damage.

@Vietnam:Introduction

Background: France occupied all of Vietnam by 1884. Independence was
declared after World War II, but the French continued to rule until
1954 when they were defeated by communist forces under HO Chi Minh,
who took control of the north. US economic and military aid to South
Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the
government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire
agreement in 1973. Two years later North Vietnamese forces overran the
south. Economic reconstruction of the reunited country has proven
difficult as aging Communist Party leaders have only grudgingly
initiated reforms necessary for a free market.

@Vietnam:Economy

Economy - overview: Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of financial
support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally
planned economy. Substantial progress was achieved from 1986 to 1996
in moving forward from an extremely low starting point - growth
averaged around 9% per year from 1993 to 1997. The 1997 Asian
financial crisis highlighted the problems existing in the Vietnamese
economy but, rather than prompting reform, reaffirmed the government's
belief that shifting to a market oriented economy leads to disaster.
GDP growth of 8.5% in 1997 fell to 4% in 1998 and rose slightly to an
estimated 4.8% in 1999. These numbers masked some major difficulties
that are emerging in economic performance. Many domestic industries,
including coal, cement, steel, and paper, have reported large
stockpiles of inventory and tough competition from more efficient
foreign producers. Foreign direct investment has fallen dramatically,
from $8.3 billion in 1996 to about $1.6 billion in 1999. Meanwhile,
Vietnamese authorities have slowed implementation of the structural
reforms needed to revitalize the economy and produce more competitive,
export-driven industries. Privatization of state enterprises remains
bogged down in political controversy, while the country's dynamic
private sector is denied both financing and access to markets. Reform
of the banking sector - considered one of the riskiest in the world -
is proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable
to tap sufficient domestic savings to finance growth. Administrative
and legal barriers are also causing costly delays for foreign
investors and are raising similar doubts about Vietnam's ability to
attract additional foreign capital.

GDP: purchasing power parity - $143.1 billion (1999 est.)

GDP - real growth rate: 4.8% (1999 est.)

GDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,850 (1999 est.)

VIRGIN ISLANDS

@Virgin Islands:Introduction

Background: During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided into
two territorial units, one English and the other Danish. Sugarcane,
produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th
and early 19th centuries. In 1917, the US purchased the Danish
portion, which had been in economic decline since the abolition of
slavery in 1848.

@West Bank:Introduction

Background: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and
responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the
West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim
Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning
Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River
Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The
DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
transitional period for external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Permanent status
is to be determined through direct negotiations, which resumed in
September 1999 after a three-year hiatus.

Economy - overview: Economic conditions in the West Bank - where
economic activity is governed by the Paris Economic Protocol of April
1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority - have deteriorated
since the early 1990s. Real per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza
Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and 1996 owing to the
combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust population
growth. The downturn in economic activity was largely the result of
Israeli closure policies - the imposition of generalized border
closures in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted
previously established labor and commodity market relationships
between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious negative social effect
of this downturn has been the emergence of chronic unemployment;
average unemployment rates in the WBGS during the 1980s were generally
under 5%; by the mid-1990s this level had risen to over 20%. Since
1997 Israel's use of comprehensive closures has decreased and, in
1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures
and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and
labor. In October 1999, Israel permitted the opening of a safe passage
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the 1995
Interim Agreement. These changes in the conduct of economic activity
have fueled a moderate economic recovery in 1998-99.

Economy - overview: Growth in global output (gross world product, GWP)
rose to 3% in 1999 from 2% in 1998 despite continued recession in
Japan, severe financial difficulties in other East Asian countries,
and widespread dislocations in several transition economies, notably
Russia. The US economy continued its remarkable sustained prosperity,
growing at 4.1% in 1999, and accounted for 23% of GWP. Western
Europe's economies grew at roughly 2%, not enough to cut deeply into
the region's high unemployment; the EU economies produced 20% of GWP.
China, the second largest economy in the world, continued its strong
growth and accounted for 12% of GWP. Japan grew at only 0.3% in 1999;
its share in GWP is 7%. As usual, the 15 successor nations of the USSR
and the other old Warsaw Pact nations experienced widely different
rates of growth. The developing nations varied widely in their growth
results, with many countries facing population increases that eat up
gains in output. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government often finds its control over
resources slipping as separatist regional movements - typically based
on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in many of the successor states of
the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in
Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded
globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal
problems and priorities, the industrialized countries devote
insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of
the world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are
becoming further marginalized. Continued financial difficulties in
East Asia, Russia, and many African nations cast a shadow over
short-term global economic prospects. The introduction of the euro as
the common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999, while
strengthening prospects for an integrated economic powerhouse, poses
serious economic risks because of varying levels of income and
cultural and political differences among the participating nations.

1999, see the individual country entries.)

YEMEN

@Yemen:Introduction

Background: North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in
1918. The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the
southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what
became South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted
a Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of
Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of
hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified
as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in
1994 was quickly subdued.

@Yemen:Economy

Economy - overview: Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab
world, reported strong growth in the mid-1990s with the onset of oil
production, but was harmed by low oil prices in 1998. Yemen has
embarked on an IMF-supported structural adjustment program designed to
modernize and streamline the economy, which has led to foreign debt
relief and restructuring. Aided by higher oil prices in 1999, Yemen
worked to maintain tight control over spending and implement
additional components of the IMF program. The high population growth
rate of 3.4% and internal political dissension complicate the
government's task.

@Zambia:Introduction

Background: The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the
South Africa Company from 1891 until takeover by the UK in 1923.
During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and
immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964.
In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices and a prolonged
drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to
one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment
of opposition parties.

ZIMBABWE

@Zimbabwe:Introduction

Background: The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the South Africa
Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated to keep whites in
power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence,
but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded voting rights for
the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN
sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in
1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the
nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as
president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system
since independence.

@Zimbabwe:Economy

Economy - overview: The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of
difficult economic problems as it struggles to consolidate earlier
progress in developing a market-oriented economy. Its involvement in
the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, has
already drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy.
Badly needed support from the IMF suffers delays in part because of
the country's failure to meet budgetary goals. Inflation rose from an
annual rate of 32% in 1998 to 59% in 1999. The economy is being
steadily weakened by AIDS; Zimbabwe has the highest rate of infection
in the world. Per capita GDP, which is twice the average of the poorer
sub-Saharan nations, will increase little if any in the near-term, and
Zimbabwe will suffer continued frustrations in developing its
agricultural and mineral resources.

@NOTES AND DEFINITIONS

In addition to the updating of information, the following changes have
been made in this edition of The World Factbook. There is a new
'country profile' on the Southern Ocean. The name Wake Atoll has been
officially changed back to Wake Island. There are new entries on
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Telephones - main lines in use, and
Telephones - mobile cellular. The Background entry, which was
introduced in the 1999 edition, has now been completed for over 200
countries. The terms and abbreviations used in the Environment-current
issues entry are now explained in the Notes and Definitions section of
the prefatory material.

Abbreviations: This information is included in [1]Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in
the Factbook, with their expansions.

Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the numbers,
designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have
been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the population
according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14
years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a
population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with
young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more
in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage
ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age
structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to
find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture - products: This entry is a rank ordering of major crops
and products starting with the most important.

Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s)
may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt,
sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have
facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with paved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For
airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m,
(2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and
(5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in
this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces).
For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m,
(2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and
(5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in
this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.

Appendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of
all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Area - comparative: This entry provides an area comparison based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US
or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are
compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in
Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Background: This entry usually highlights major historic events and
current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future
trends.

Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of births
during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also
known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant
factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on
both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital
expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of government.

Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical weather
regimes throughout the year.

Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary between
the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Communications: This category deals with the means of exchanging
information and includes the telephone, radio, television, and
Internet service provider entries.

Communications - note: This entry includes miscellaneous
communications information of significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,
and major amendments.

Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in
color. The maps were produced from the best information available at
the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed
subsequently.

Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's name
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an
example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional
short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short
form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.
Also see the Terminology note.

Currency: This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and
its basic subunit.

Data code: This entry gives the official US Government digraph that
precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication,
or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This
two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards
Publication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the
Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of
State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and
incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of
area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data
between databases. [2]Appendix F cross-references various country data
codes and [3]Appendix G cross-references various hydrographic data
codes.

Data codes - country: This information is presented in [4]Appendix F:
Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which includes the US
Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
codes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes,
and Internet codes for land entities.

Data codes - hydrographic: This information is presented in
[5]Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which
includes the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes,
Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the
National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for hydrographic entities. The US
Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data codes
similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.

Date of information: In general, information available as of 1 January
2000, was used in the preparation of this edition.

Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of deaths
during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the
mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current
mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly
affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show
a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in
mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging
population.

Debt - external: This entry gives the total amount of public foreign
financial obligations.

Dependency status: This entry describes the formal relationship
between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all
nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular
independent state.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 independent states, including 181 of the 188 UN members
(excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former
Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic
relations with 3 independent states that are not in the UN - Holy See,
Switzerland, and Tuvalu.

Diplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes the chief
of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX
number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the chief of
the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone number, FAX number,
consulate general locations, consulate locations, honorary consulate
general locations, and honorary consulate locations.

Disputes - international: This entry includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;
however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid - donor: This entry refers to net official development
assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing countries and
multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as financial assistance
that is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote
economic development and welfare of the less developed countries
(LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least 25%. The entry does
not cover other official flows (OOF) or private flows.

Economic aid - recipient: This entry, which is subject to major
problems of definition and statistical coverage, refers to the net
inflow of Official Development Finance (ODF) to recipient countries.
The figure includes assistance from the World Bank, the IMF, and other
international organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal
commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from the data are
grants by private organizations. Aid comes in various forms including
outright grants and loans. The entry thus is the difference between
new inflows and repayments.

Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the size,
development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,
labor, and capital.

Economy - overview: This entry briefly describes the type of economy,
including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic
development, the most important natural resources, and the unique
areas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events
and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a
statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity - consumption: This entry consists of total electricity
generated annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in
kilowatt hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity
generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is
accounted for as loss in transmission and distribution.

Electricity - exports: This entry is the total exported electricity in
kilowatt hours.

Electricity - imports: This entry is the total imported electricity in
kilowatt hours.

Electricity - production: This entry is the annual electricity
generated expressed in kilowatt hours. The discrepancy between the
amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the amount
consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in transmission and
distribution.

Electricity - production by source: This entry indicates the
percentage share of annual electricity production of each energy
source. These are fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, and other (solar,
geothermal, and wind).

Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest point and the
lowest point.

Entities: Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are
not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or
for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the
US Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 267 separate geographic entities in The
World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Environment - current issues: This entry lists the most pressing and
important environmental problems. The following terms and
abbreviations are used throughout the entry:

acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid
precipitation and deposition; this process disrupts ecosystem nutrient
flows and may kill freshwater fish and plants dependent on more
neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid rain).

acid rain  characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur
dioxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly to the earth's
fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale where 7 is
neutral, values greater that 7 are considered alkaline, and anything
measured below 5.6 is considered acid precipitation; note - a pH of
2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in New
England.

asbestos  a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in
fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic.

biodiversity - also biological diversity; many species, diverse in
form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, and ecosystem
level; loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem's ability to recover
from natural or man-induced disruption.

catchments  assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and
runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited
freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.

DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)  a colorless, odorless
insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was
banned in the US in 1972.

defoliants  chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves
artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,
and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.

deforestation  the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,
unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land
clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel)
without planting new growth.

desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or
semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive
soils, or climate change.

dredging - in general, the practice of deepening an existing waterway;
more specifically, a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling
marine organisms (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing
significant destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.

driftnet fishing  done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally
anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in
an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial
marine species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the ocean clean".

ecosystems  ecological units comprised of complex communities of
organisms and their specific environments.

effluents  waste materials, such as smoke or sewage, which are
released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.

endangered species  a species that is threatened with extinction
either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.

freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources
include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.

groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often
in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source
for wells and natural springs.

Highlands Water Project  a series of dams constructed jointly by
Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply
into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest
infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly
and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it
forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders
economic resources.

Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC)  represents the 125,000 Inuits of
Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental
issues; a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of
the ICC; the most current concerns are longrange transport of
pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.

metallurgical plants  industries which specialize in the science,
technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly
concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of
ground water and air when not properly disposed.

noxious substances  injurious, very harmful to living beings.

overgrazing  the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it
can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a
common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.

ozone shield  a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)
that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and
absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living
organisms.

poaching  the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with
respect to endangered or threatened species.

pollution  the contamination of a healthy environment by manmade
waste.

potable water  water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.

salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes
salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process.

siltation  occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted
with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.

slashandburn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which
trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary
agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which
point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is
sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for
regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do
not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the
environment .

soil degradation  damage to the land's productive capacity because of
poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides
and fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of
top soil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce
agricultural products.

soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,
compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,
and desertification.

ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy
emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by
the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and
has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.

water-born diseases  those in which the bacteria survive in, and is
transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an
untreated water supply.

Environment - international agreements: This entry separates country
participation in international environmental agreements into two
levels - party to and signed but not ratified. Agreements are listed
in alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements: This information is presented in [6]Appendix
D: Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the
name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into
force, objective, and parties by category.

Ethnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups
starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total
population.

Exchange rates: This entry provides the official value of a country's
monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as
expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined
by international market forces or official fiat.

Executive branch: This entry includes several subfields. Chief of
state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may
not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head
of government includes the name and title of the top administrative
leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. Cabinet includes the official name for this body of
high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of members.
Elections includes the nature of election process or accession to
power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.
Election results includes the percent of vote for each candidate in
the last election. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and
the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the president
is both the chief of state and the head of government.

Exports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of exports on
an f.o.b. (free on board) basis.

Exports - commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of exported
products starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Exports - partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Fiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for
a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the
calendar year but which may begin in any month. All yearly references
are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar
fiscal year (FY).

Flag description: This entry provides a written flag description
produced from actual flags or the best information available at the
time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used
by their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local
flag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at
the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced
from actual flags or the best information available at the time of
preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their
dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all
final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP
dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power
parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more
information.

GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations
rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The
PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price
weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and
services produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP
method provide the best available starting point for comparisons of
economic strength and well-being between countries. The division of a
GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD
countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries
are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on
extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International
Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan
Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In
contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of
international and domestic financial forces that often have little
relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak
currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically
one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates
may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or
official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12
January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial
Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued
their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real
output of these countries by half. One important caution: the
proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in
local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion
when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an
observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese
military expenditures. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic
data can not be chained together from successive volumes of the
Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions
of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of
information, and changes in national statistical methods and
practices.

GDP - composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP.

GDP - per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity
basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP - real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis
adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.

Geographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude and
longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate
geographic center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of
Conventional Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic
Names and on other sources.

Geographic names: This information is presented in [7]Appendix H:
Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates where various
geographic names - including alternate names, former names, political
or geographical portions of larger entities, and the location of all
US Foreign Service posts - can be found in The World Factbook.
Spellings are normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board
on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in
parentheses, while additional information is included in brackets.

Geography: This category includes the entries dealing with the natural
environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography - note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

GNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from
domestic production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses
GDP rather than GNP to measure national production. However, the user
must realize that in certain countries net remittances from citizens
working abroad may be important to national well-being.

Government: This category includes the entries dealing with the system
for the adoption and administration of public policy.

Government type: This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g.,
republic, constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary
democracy, military dictatorship).

Government - note: This entry includes miscellaneous government
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Gross domestic product: see GDP

takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other
services).

Highways: This entry includes the total length of the highway system
as well as the length of the paved and unpaved components.

Household income or consumption by percentage share: Data on household
income or consumption come from household surveys, the results
adjusted for household size. Nations use different standards and
procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on
income will normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys
based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time,
yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.

Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five categories of
illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),
hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs
legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside of medical channels.

hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,

to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural
narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine
(MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with
codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include
heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of
the opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature, dried
opium poppy.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.

Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,
Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of imports on
a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board)
basis.

Imports - commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of imported
products starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Imports - partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Independence: For most countries, this entry gives the date that
sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or
trusteeship. For the other countries, the date given may not represent
"independence" in the strict sense, but rather some significant
nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental
change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas
include the notation "none" followed by the nature of their dependency
status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the annual
percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,
mining, and construction).

Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting
with the largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths of
infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in
the same year. This rate is often used an indicator of the level of
health in a country.

Inflation rate (consumer prices): This entry furnishes the annual
percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's
consumer prices.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs): This entry supplies the number of
Internet Service Providers within a country. An ISP is defined as a
company that provides access to the Internet.

International disputes: see Disputes - international

International organization participation: This entry lists in
alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations
in which the subject country is a member or participates in some other
way.

International organizations: This information is presented in
[8]Appendix C: International Organizations and Groups which includes
the name, abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX, date established,
aim, and members by category.

Introduction: This category includes one entry, Background.

Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square kilometers of
land area that is artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the highest
court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.

Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force figure.

Labor force - by occupation: This entry contains a rank ordering of
component parts of the labor force by occupation.

Land boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all land
boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous
border countries.

Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area
for five different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated
for crops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and
rice; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not
replanted after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber;
permanent pastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage
crops; forests and woodland - land under dense or open stands of
trees; other - any land type not specifically mentioned above, such as
urban areas, roads, desert, etc.

Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population speaking that language.

Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the legal
system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of
International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the structure
(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and
term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number
of seats held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components.
Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life
in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be
thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial
measures.

Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census
Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There
are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition
- the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the
standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read
and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is
probably the most easily available and valid for international
comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can
impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
changing, technology-driven world.

Location: This entry identifies the country's regional location,
neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference
map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic
coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.

Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims: contiguous
zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing
zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country),
other (unique maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line
or North Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The
proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from
being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil
rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or
register. This entry contains information in two subfields - total and
ships by type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or
over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. Ships
by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo
ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers,
container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock
carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger
ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo
ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,
specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.

A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory,
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an offshore
register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a
captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a
local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and
taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a
captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the
parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also
be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of
convenience register, except that it is not the register of an
independent state.

A flag of convenience register is a national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.

A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home
or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a
ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be
placed on the register.

An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign
nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are
the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been
instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of
convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and
Danish flags.

A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but
accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.

A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as
listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the
compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a
ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws
of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the
nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Military: This category includes the entries dealing with a country's
military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military branches: This entry lists the names of the ground, naval,
air, marine, and other defense or security forces.

Military expenditures - dollar figure: This entry gives current
military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by
multiplying the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the
gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an exchange rate basis not
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. However, in the case of Russia,
estimates of military expenditures have been made using PPP. Dollar
figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution
because of different price patterns and accounting methods among
nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their
currencies.

Military expenditures - percent of GDP: This entry gives current
military expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).

Military manpower - availability: This entry gives the total numbers
of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is
fit to serve.

Military manpower - fit for military service: This entry gives the
number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This
is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability
which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and
reduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of
the actual number fit to serve.

Military manpower - military age: This entry gives the minimum age at
which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject
to conscription.

Military manpower - reaching military age annually: This entry gives
the number of draft-age males and females entering the military
manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability
of draft-age young adults.

Military - note: This entry includes miscellaneous military
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day of
celebration - usually independence day.

Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens -
noun and adjective.

Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,
hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the difference
between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during
the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of
persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,
3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The
net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the
overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife
(if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps
in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

People: This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People - note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Personal Names - Capitalization: The Factbook capitalizes the surname
or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are
faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. An
example would be President SADDAM Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name
and Husayn is his father's name. He may be referred to as President
SADDAM Husayn or President SADDAM, but not President Husayn. The need
for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other
indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following
examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, William Jefferson CLINTON, and
TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin
Alam Shah. By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital
letters can be used with confidence as in President Saddam, President
Castro, Chairman Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin.
The same system of capitalization is extended to the names of leaders
with surnames that are not commonly used such as Queen ELIZABETH II.

Personal Names - Spelling: The romanization of personal names in the
Factbook normally follows the same transliteration system used by the
US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times,
however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the
media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that
differs from the transliteration derived from the US Government
standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.

Personal Names - Titles: The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or
short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name. A title
standing alone is lowercased. Examples: President PUTIN and President
CLINTON are chiefs of state. In Russia, the president is chief of
state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the US,
the president is both chief of state and head of government.

Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for
transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products.

Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing of
significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a listing
of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing
for legislative election.

Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the
Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past
and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents
one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the
world and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have
explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin,
Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic
of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti,
Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria,
Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Population below poverty line: National estimates of the percentage of
the population lying below the poverty line are based on surveys of
sub-groups, with the results weighted by the number of people in each
group. Definitions of poverty vary considerably among nations. For
example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of
poverty than poor nations.

Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The
rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in
determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the
changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools,
hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water,
electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as
threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and harbors
selected on the basis of overall importance to each country. This is
determined by evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of
goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).

Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total number of AM,
FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.

Railways: This entry includes the total route length of the railway
network and component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard,
and other.

Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and special or
current interest maps.

Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions by
adherents starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the
percent of total population.

Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each female in
five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and
over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some
countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners.

Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the
right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of
the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)
in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not
presented is the international access code, which varies from country
to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call
placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:

011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where

011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls

(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),

[34] is the country code for Spain,

(1) is the city code for Madrid,

577 is the local exchange, and

xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial telephone call placed from another
country to the US would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where

[1] is the country code for the US,

(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,

939 is the local exchange, and

xxxx is the local telephone number.

switched telephone network or the international Datel network.

telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated
electric impulse transmission.

telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected by
wire through automatic exchanges.

tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in which
the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of the
incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional
antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;
reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up
to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of
this system for very long distances.

trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by
multichannel trunk lines.

UHF - ultra-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to
3,000-MHz range.

VHF - very-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz
range.

Telephones - main lines in use: This entry gives the total number of
main telephone lines in use.

Telephones - mobile cellular: This entry gives the total number of
mobile cellular telephones in use.

Television - broadcast stations: This entry gives the total number of
separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.

Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television sets.

Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook
database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,
the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil
defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The
Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and
former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates
such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are
not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of
their dependency status noted in this same entry.

Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the average number
of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end
of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given
fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct
measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it
refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for
population growth in the country. High rates will also place some
limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers
of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit
the ability of the families to feed and educate their children.

Transnational Issues: This category includes only two entries at the
present time - Disputes - international and Illicit drugs - that deal
with current issues going beyond national boundaries.

Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing with the
means for movement of people and goods.

Transportation - note: This entry includes miscellaneous
transportation information of significance not included elsewhere.

Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the labor force
that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

United Nations System: This information is presented in [9]Appendix B:
United Nations System as a chart, table, or text (depending on the
version of the Factbook) that shows the organization of the UN in
detail.

Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual names of
navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Weights and measures: This information is presented in [10]Appendix E:
Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical
powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,
weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting
period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is
an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates.

Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) ceases to
exist. None of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia,
including Serbia and Montenegro, have been permitted to participate
solely on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the
United Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and
their subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations specialized
agencies. The United Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate
of the SFRY to remain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to
function, and continues to fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For
a variety of reasons, a number of other organizations have not yet
taken action with regard to the membership of the former Yugoslavia.
The World Factbook HomeHome therefore continues to list Yugoslavia
under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where
no action has yet been taken.

Note: At this time, only three countries - Burma, Liberia, and the US
- have not adopted the International System of Units (SI, or metric
system) as their official system of weights and measures. Although use
of the metric system has been sanctioned by law in the US since 1866,
it has been slow in displacing the American adaptation of the British
Imperial System known as the US Customary System. The US is the only
industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in
its commercial and standards activities, but there is increasing
acceptance in science, medicine, government, and many sectors of
industry.

@Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes

FIPS 10-4: Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and
Their Principal Administrative Divisions (FIPS PUB 10-4) is maintained
by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues (Department of
State) and published by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Department of Commerce). These two-character alphabetic
codes are included in the text of the Factbook in the Data code entry
under the Government category. FIPS 10-4 codes are intended for
general use throughout the US Government, especially in activities
associated with the mission of the Department of State and national
defense programs.

ISO 3166: Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries (ISO
3166) is prepared by the International Organization for
Standardization. ISO 3166 includes two- and three-character alphabetic
codes and three-digit numeric codes that may be needed for activities
involving exchange of data with international organizations that have
adopted that standard. Except for the numeric codes, ISO 3166 codes
have been adopted in the US as FIPS 104-1: American National Standard
Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries, Dependencies, and
Areas of Special Sovereignty for Information Interchange.

Internet: This is a provisional compilation that generally agrees with
the ISO 3166 two-character alphabetic codes.

   The US Government has not yet adopted a standard for hydrographic
   codes similar to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
   10-4 country codes. The names and limits of the following oceans and
   seas are not always directly comparable because of differences in the
   customers, needs, and requirements of the individual organizations.
   Even the number of principal water bodies varies from organization to
   organization. Factbook users, for example, find the Atlantic Ocean and
   Pacific Ocean entries useful, but none of the following standards
   include those oceans in their entirety. Nor is there any provision for
   combining codes or overcodes to aggregate water bodies.  The recently
   delimited Southern Ocean is not included.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
