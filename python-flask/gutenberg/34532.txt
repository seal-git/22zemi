                   A Synopsis of the American Bats
                      of the Genus Pipistrellus

                                  By

                E. RAYMOND HALL AND WALTER W. DALQUEST


Four nominal species of the genus _Pipistrellus_ are currently
recognized in North America. They are _Pipistrellus subflavus_
(F. Cuvier) of eastern North America, _Pipistrellus hesperus_ (H. Allen)
of western North America, _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ (Ward) from
Veracruz, Mexico, and _Pipistrellus cinnamomeus_ Miller from Tabasco,
Mexico.

In the past three years, specimens have been obtained in Veracruz (by
Dalquest) of each of the southern species. One of these, _P.
cinnamomeus_, previously was known from a single specimen; the other,
_P. veracrucis_, was known only from six specimens which now are lost
or misplaced. The results of our study of these recently acquired
Mexican specimens constitute our principal contribution in this paper;
we have done little more with the material from the United States and
Canada than to codify the findings of other mammalogists with respect
to the systematic status and geographic distribution.

Study of the available specimens reveals that there are only two
species, _Pipistrellus hesperus_ and _Pipistrellus subflavus_;
_Pipistrellus veracrucis_ proves to be only a subspecies (geographic
race) of _P. subflavus_, and _Pipistrellus cinnamomeus_ proves to be a
species of another genus, _Myotis_ (see Hall and Dalquest, page 583 of
this volume).

  Schreber (not seen by us, after Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:87,
  1897).

_Range in the New World._--In North America from southern Canada to
Honduras (47 degrees to 5 degrees North Latitude) and from the
Atlantic to the Pacific; not recorded from the West Indies or South
America.

_Characters._--Size small; tail approximately as long as outstretched
leg; ears well developed with prominent tragus; dental formula: i.2/3;
c.1/1; p.2/2; m.3/3; two upper incisors subequal and outer one lacking
a concavity on surface facing canine; dentition otherwise essentially
as in _Myotis_ Kaup except that third premolar is always, instead of
rarely, absent.

_Remarks._--There are two species in North America. Their geographic
ranges, as now known, meet, but do not overlap. Certain differences
between the two species are listed in the parallel columns below. Most
of these differences in the skull and teeth are illustrated in figures
22 and 23 on page 92 of Miller's "Revision of the North American bats
of the family Vespertilionidae (N. Amer. Fauna, 13, 1897)."

+Pipistrellus hesperus+

(Synonomy under subspecies)

_Range._--Arid Sonoran life-zones of western North America from
Washington southward to Jalisco.

_Characters._--Smoke Gray to Buff Brown (Capitalized color terms after
Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
1912) dorsally; total length, 60 to 86; foot less than half as long as
tibia; tragus blunt with terminal part bent forward; skull nearly
straight in dorsal profile; inner upper incisor unicuspidate; outer
upper incisor with accessory cusp on anterointernal face; P1, viewed
from occlusal face, less than a seventh of area of canine, and from
labial aspect concealed by canine and fourth premolar; lower, third
premolar lower than anterior cusp of canine; lower premolars crowded,
distance between canine and first molar less than length of second
lower molar.

_Remarks._--In the United States and in the northern part of Mexico,
_P. hesperus_ is the smallest bat found. Little is known about its
habits. It emerges earlier in the evening than other species of bats.
The frequency with which it is seen near cliffs suggests that it finds
concealment under rocks. In winter, in Nevada (Hall, Mammals of
Nevada, p. 150, 1946), _P. hesperus_ has been found singly in crevices
in the roofs of mine tunnels.

In the United States National Museum in July, 1949, the specimen
providing the easternmost record station of occurrence was examined by
us. This is No. 23591, in alcohol, taken on August 24, 1890, by
William Lloyd, original No. 88, at the mouth of the Pecos River in
Texas. In the same collection there is a specimen of _Pipistrellus
subflavus_ providing the westernmost record of occurrence of that
species. This specimen, a skin with skull, is No. 126729, [Male],
taken on May 3, 1903, by Jas. H. Gaut, original No. 1271, at Comstock,
Texas. The two localities concerned are in the Valley of the Rio
Grande, and are only about five miles apart. Nevertheless, the two
specimens are clearly referable to their respective species and show
no tendency toward intergradation. Consequently, confidence is felt in
treating _Pipistrellus hesperus_ and _Pipistrellus subflavus_ as two
distinct species.

The most recent report upon geographic variation throughout the entire
species, _Pipistrellus hesperus_, was that by Hatfield (Jour. Mamm.,
17:257-262, August 14, 1936). Later, as explained below in the account
of _P. h. australis_, Burt (Miscl. Publ., Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan,
39:25, February 15, 1938) examined specimens from Sonora, Mexico, and
for them and for specimens from southern Arizona proposed a different
nomenclatural arrangement.

  _Pipistrellus hesperus apus_ Elliot, Field Columb. Mus., pub. 90,
  zool. ser., 3:269, March 8, 1904. Type from Providencia Mines,
  Sonora, Mexico.

_Type locality._--Barranca Ibarra, Jalisco, Mexico.

_Range._--Central Arizona south to Jalisco and including the southern
half of Baja California. Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield, _op.
cit._: 261, unless otherwise indicated) are: _Arizona_: Camp Verde;
Fort Bowie. _Sonora_: Pilares (Burt, Miscl. Publ., Mus. Zool., Univ.
Michigan, 39:24, 1938). _Jalisco_: Barranca Ibarra (Miller, orig.
descr.). _Baja California_: Miraflores; San Ignacio. _Arizona_: Bates
Well.

_Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; total length, 67.1(60-72);
tibia, 11.3(10.1-12.3); forearm, 28.4(26.3-30.0); greatest length of
skull, 11.7(11.3-12.0); breadth of braincase, 6.1(5.9-6.3). Color:
between Cinnamon Drab and Drab, dorsally; Wood Brown to Light Drab,
ventrally (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:260).

_Remarks._--Hatfield (_op. cit._) examined no specimens from Mexico
(Baja California excepted) and Burt (_op. cit._) who did examine some
specimens (from Sonora), referred one from northwestern Sonora to _P.
h. hesperus_ and those from northeastern Sonora to _P. h. merriami_.
Since our treatment of subspecies of _Pipistrellus_ (_P. s. veracrucis_
excepted) aims merely to reflect the latest systematic treatment
accorded the animals, we would follow Burt (_op. cit._) were it not
for the fact that he shows the geographic range of _P. h. merriami_
separated by the range of _P. h. hesperus_ into two parts. This is
inconsistent with the ordinarily accepted concept of subspecies.
Consequently, we have followed Hatfield (_op. cit._). Clearly, a
critical study is needed of adequate material of _Pipistrellus
hesperus_ of Mexico.

  _Pipistrellus hesperus maximus_ Hatfield, Jour. Mamm., 17:261,
  August 14, 1936.

_Type locality._--Dog Spring, Hidalgo County, New Mexico.

_Range._--Southern New Mexico, western Texas and probably the
adjoining parts of Mexico. Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield [_op.
cit._:261] except as otherwise indicated) are: _New Mexico_: Animas
Valley; Florida Mountains; Carlsbad Cave. _Texas_: Mouth of Pecos
River (Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 25:210, 1905); Boquillas (Borell and

tibia, 12.3(11.7-13.1); forearm, 32.9(31.8-33.3); greatest length of
skull, 12.7(12.3-12.9); breadth of braincase, 6.6(6.5-6.7). Color

_Range._--New Mexico (excepting southern part) and western Colorado.
Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:262) are: _Colorado_:
Bedrock. _New Mexico_: Santa Rosa; Socorro; Laguna.

_Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; total length, 82.0(80-86);

+Pipistrellus subflavus+

(Synonomy under subspecies)

_Range._--Canadian to Tropical life-zones of eastern North America
from Quebec southward to Honduras.

_Characters._--Sayal Brown to darker than Mummy Brown, dorsally; total
length, 73-89; foot more than half as long as tibia; tragus tapering
and straight; dorsal profile of skull convex in interorbital region;
inner upper incisor bicuspidate; outer upper incisor unicuspidate
(lacking accessory cusp on anterointernal face); P1 viewed from
occlusal face more than a seventh of area of canine and visible from
labial aspect; lower, third premolar as high as anterior cusp of
canine; lower premolars less crowded than in _P. hesperus_ and
distance between canine and first molar less than length of second
lower molar.

_Remarks._--In winter this species hibernates in caves in clusters of
fewer than fifty individuals, but in summer fewer of the bats live
there and at this season some have been captured as far as thirty
miles from any such retreat suggesting that the bats inhabit other
types of shelter. The wide range of this species in respect to
life-zones is noteworthy; it occurs in the Canadian Life-zone (Joliet,
Quebec), the Tropical Life-zone (30 km. SSE Jesús Carranza, Veracruz)
and in the intervening life-zones.

The longer thumb of this species, in comparison with that of
_Pipistrellus hesperus_, was verified by measuring the thumb including
its claw and the pad at the base of the thumb in 12 _P. s. veracrucis_
and 10 _P. h. maximus_. In _veracrucis_ the mean was 5.9 millimeters
and the extremes were 5.5 and 6.4. In _maximus_ the corresponding
figures were 3.9, 3.6 and 4.3.

ranging from Snuff Brown to Sayal Brown.


+Pipistrellus subflavus obscurus+ Miller

  _Pipistrellus subflavus obscurus_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:93,
  October 16, 1897.

_Type locality._--Lake George, Warren County, New York.

_Range._--From southern Quebec and southern Ontario south to southern
Ohio and West Virginia; from the Atlantic Coast west into Wisconsin.
Marginal occurrences are: _Minnesota_: St. Peter (Swanson and Evans,
Jour. Mamm., 17:39, 1936); Marine (Swanson, Tech. Bull. No. 2,
Minnesota Dept. Conservation, p. 60, 1945). _Wisconsin_: Hurley
(Greeley and Beer, Jour. Mamm., 30:198, 1949). _Quebec_: Joliet
(Anderson, Nat. Mus. Canada, Biol. ser. No. 31, Bull. 102:30, 1946).
_Vermont_: Brandon (Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 19:436, 1938). _Maine_: No
locality more precise than the state (Allen, Occ. Papers Boston Soc.
Nat. Hist., 7(3):35, June, 1904). _New York_: Hastings on Hudson
(Rowley, Abstr. of Proc. Linnean Soc. N. Y., for yr. ending March 11,
1902, p. 57). _Pennsylvania_: Beaver (Rhoads, Mamms. Pa. and N. J.,
1903, p. 211). _West Virginia_: Cornwall's Cave (Frum, Jour. Mamm.,
25:195, 1944). _Ohio_: Cat Run (Bole and Moulthrop, Sci. Publs.
Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5(6):116, 1942); Symmes Creek (Bole and
Moulthrop, _loc. cit._); Dry Cave (Bole and Moulthrop, _loc. cit._);
"Union County" (Rausch, Jour. Mamm., 27:275, 1946). _Wisconsin_:
Devils Lake (Jackson, Jour. Mamm., 1:38, 1919).

_Diagnosis._--"... color duller and less yellow, and dark tips of
shorter hairs on back more conspicuous" than in _P. subflavus
subflavus_ according to the original description.

_Remarks._--No one, as far as we know, has carefully studied the
variation in _Pipistrellus subflavus_ of the United States and Canada
since Miller named _P. s. obscurus_. With the more abundant material
now available, such an appraisal would be worth-while. The occurrences
cited above for Minnesota and Wisconsin were recorded in the
literature under the specific name without indication of subspecific
affinity. The reference of specimens from these states to the
subspecies _P. s. obscurus_ is an arbitrary assignment on our part; we
have not seen them. However, two specimens in the University of Kansas
Museum of Natural History from Potosi (Snake Cave) Grant County,
Wisconsin, are referable to _P. s. obscurus_. These provide the
southwesternmost record station of occurrence in Wisconsin but are
not shown on the distribution map because the specimens were received
after figure 1 was prepared.

It is noteworthy that the species _Pipistrellus subflavus_ has not
yet, as far as we can ascertain, been recorded from Michigan, northern
Indiana, northern Illinois, or Iowa. Probably the species occurs in
these areas.


+Pipistrellus subflavus veracrucis+ (Ward)

  _Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, Amer. Nat., 25:745, August, 1891.

  _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:93, October
  16, 1897.

_Type locality._--Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., Veracruz.

_Range._--Eastern Mexico, certainly from the type locality southward
into Honduras. Records of occurrence are: _Veracruz_: Las Vigas (13
specimens from 4 km. E Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., K. U.); 30 km. SSE Jesús
Carranza, 1 (K. U.). _Honduras_: Jilamo Farm, Tela District, 3 (Univ.
Michigan).

_Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; measurements of 13 near
topotypes are: total length, 78(73-85); tibia, 12.9(11.8-14.7);
forearm, 31.8(29.5-33.1); greatest length of skull (exclusive of
incisors), 12.2(11.8-12.6); breadth of braincase immediately above
roots of zygomatic arches, 6.3(6.0-6.7). Color darker than Mummy Brown
above and below.

_Remarks._--The specimen from thirty kilometers south-southeast of
Jesús Carranza, Veracruz, and the three specimens from Honduras agree
in all respects with topotypes. The color of _P. s. veracrucis_ is
much darker than that of _P. s. obscurus_ and is between black and the
darkest brown in Ridgway's (_op. cit._) color key. Rinker (Jour.
Mamm., 29:179-180,1948) described the three specimens from Honduras
without assigning a specific name to them because he lacked topotypes
of _P. s. veracrucis_. We find nothing in his description to correct,
but can add that the upper tooth-rows in many, but not in all,
specimens of _P. s. veracrucis_ are straighter than in _P. s.
subflavus_. Probably it was this feature to which Rinker referred when
he said that in _veracrucis_ "The tooth rows tend to be more
convergent posteriorly." Rinker did not refer the three specimens from
Honduras to _P. veracrucis_ because Ward's original description states
that _veracrucis_ has evenly spaced lower incisors and a basal cusp on
the lower canine on only its forward edge. Rinker's specimens from
Honduras have the first incisors in contact with each other, the
second incisors in contact with the first incisors and the third
incisor on each side of the lower jaw separated by a space from the
second incisor and from the canine. The specimens from Honduras have a
basal cusp on the hinder edge of the lower canine. In these two
features they agree with the specimens from Veracruz and with
specimens of _Pipistrellus subflavus_ from the United States and
Canada. It is clear that Ward (Amer. Nat., 25:747,1891) was mistaken
in stating that the lower incisors of _veracrucis_ were evenly spaced
and that the canine had a basal cusp on only the forward edge. Ward
(_loc. cit._) was correct in regarding his _Vesperugo veracrucis_ as
"most closely related to _V. georgianus_ [= _Pipistrellus
subflavus_]," but for want of actual specimens of _P. subflavus_ to
use in comparison was incorrect in supposing that _P. subflavus_ had
only two bands of color on the fur, more hair on the legs, and a
larger area of hair on the interfemoral membrane. In these respects we
perceive no difference between specimens from Veracruz and the United
States.

_Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, therefore, proves to be only a subspecies
of _Pipistrellus subflavus_, but is well characterized by dark color
and small size.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
