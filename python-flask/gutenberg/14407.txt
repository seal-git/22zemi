    FOR THE CHILDREN OF SAWREY

    FROM
    OLD MR. BUNNY


[Illustration]

One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.

He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.

A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside
him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.

As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road,
and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who
lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of
all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and
Peter.

Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool
mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold
herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call
lavender).

Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.

He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of
his Cousin Peter.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red
cotton pocket-handkerchief.

"Peter," said little Benjamin, in a whisper, "who has got your clothes?"

Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how
he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.

Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr.
McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for
the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Peter said he hoped that it would rain.

At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole,
calling: "Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"

Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.

They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the
bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped
with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Little Benjamin said: "It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate;
the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."

Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below
was newly raked and quite soft.

It had been sown with lettuces.

They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially
little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back
Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the
pocket-handkerchief.

They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;
there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.

Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.

Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with
onions, as a little present for his Aunt.

Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father
to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.

(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)

The lettuces certainly were very fine.

Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently
he dropped half the onions.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree
with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of
the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red
brick wall.

The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at
Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.

Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises
worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!

He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.

This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!

Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no
time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large
basket....

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.

Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!

Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.

She sat there for _five hours_.

       *       *       *       *       *

I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,
because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it
made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.

The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon;
but still the cat sat upon the basket.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of
mortar fell from the wall above.

The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of
the wall of the upper terrace.

He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his
hand.

He was looking for his son.

Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.

He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the
cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse,
scratching off a handful of fur.

The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the
door.

Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears,
and whipped him with the little switch.

Then he took out his nephew Peter.

Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the
garden.

[Illustration]

When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several
things which perplexed him.

It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a
pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!

Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut
herself up _inside_ the greenhouse, locking the door upon the _outside_.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see
that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the
pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung
them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the
rabbit-tobacco.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
