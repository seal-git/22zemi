of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath,
or that is in the Water under the Earth: thou shalt not bow down thy
self to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
visiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third
and fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto
thousands, of them that love me and keep my Commandements._

_Quest_. Which is the Third?

Answ. _Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain_.

_Quest_. Which is the Fourth?

Answ. _Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, six days shalt thou
labour and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor
thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor
thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six dayes the Lord made
Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day, and hallowed
it_.

_Quest_. Which is the Fifth?

thy Neighbours Wife, nor his Man-servant, nor his Maid-servant, nor his
Oxe, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy Neighbour's._

_Answ._ By my Baptism and by the Word of God.

Quest. _Are you able to keep them of your self?_

Quest. _How long doth it last?_

_Answ_. For Ever and Ever.

Quest. _Is it not a sad thing to lie under the Wrath of God for ever? to
lie in devouring Flames for Ever?_

_Answ._ YES.

Quest. _Can you deliver your self from Hell?_

_Answ._ NO.

Quest. _How must you be delivered._

_Answ._ Only by Jesus Christ?

Quest. _Who is Jesus Christ?_

_Answ_. The Son of God.

Quest. _Is he not Man also?_

_Answ._ YES. He was always God, and in the Fullness of time became Man,
and so he is both God and Man, in two Natures, and one Person for ever.

Quest. _What hath Christ done for Sinners?_

_Answ._ He hath died for them.

Quest. _What Death did he die?_

_Answ._ The Death of the Cross.

Quest. _Why died he that Death?_

_Answ._ Because it is written, _Cursed is he that hangeth upon a Tree_.

Quest. _Did Christ bear the Curse of God that was due to Sinners?_

_Answ._ YES.

Quest. _Are all the World saved by him?_

    5. He is a suitable Saviour.
    6. He is an offered Saviour.

Quest. _When is Christ offered?_

_Answ._ In the Gospel.

Quest. _Name some Places?_

_Answ._ John 3. 16. _God so loved the World, that he gave his only
begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
have Everlasting Life._ John 6. 37. _Him that comes unto me, I will in
no wise cast out._ I Tim. 1. 15. _This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that_ Jesus Christ _came into the World to save
sinners._

Quest. _Multitudes are called and invited, why do they not come to
Christ?_

_Answ._ Because they are not Humble.

Quest. _Why are they not Humble?_

_Answ._ Because they do not see their sins and sinfulness.

Quest. _What must we do that we may see our sins and our sinfulnesses?_

God Preached. 3. We must Examine our Consciences. 4. We must Pray to God

_VERSES,_

_For little Children to Learn_.

    I Must Pray
    Both Night and Day.
    Before I Eat,
    I must entreat
    That God would Bless to me my Meat.
    I must not play
    On the Sabbath-day:
    But I must hear
    God's Word in Fear.
    I must not SWEAR.
    I must not Lye, I must not Feign,
    I must not take God's Name in vain.
    I must not Rail.
    I must not Steal.
    It is a Sin
    To steal a Pin,
    Much more to steal a greater thing.
    It's better for me to be poor,
    And beg my Bread from door to door,
    Than to steal my Neighbour's Store.
    I must Work, and I must Pray,
    And God will feed me day by day,
    Mine honest Labours God will Bless,
    But he hateth Idleness.
    My King, and all my Governors,
    My Parents and Superiors,
    These I must Honour and Obey,
    To these I must my Duty pay.
    I must not be Rude nor Wild,
    I must not be a Wanton Child:
    I must sing no wanton Songs,
    I must forgive my Neighbours wrongs:
    I must speak of no Man ill,
    But to all must bear good will:
    I had better die
    Than tell a Lie.
    I must not sin,
    A World to win.
    My Tongue
    Must do no wrong.
    If my Tongue do here Rebel,
    Then my Tongue must burn in Hell.
    I must Read,
    I must heed,
    And on the Scriptures I must feed.
    I must
    Put my Trust
    In Christ above,
    The God of Love.
    Christ alone my Soul can save,
    And raise my Body from the Grave.
    Christ alone must have my Heart,
    Christ and I must never part.
    Lord, Grant that I
    In Faith may dye,
    And live with Christ Eternally!
              _AMEN._

       *       *       *       *       *



_SAYINGS,_

_For little Children to Learn._


Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy Youth; and thy Creator will
remember thee in the dayes of thy Old Age.

              Praying
    Is better than Playing.
    Grace is better than Gold.
    Singing of Psalms
    Is better than Ringing of Bells.
    Mothers love young Children,
    And Christ loves young Saints.
    It is better not to live in the World,
    Than to live without God in the World.
    One day in God's Courts,
    Is better than a thousand elsewhere.
    God's Presence makes Heaven, and
    God's Absence makes Hell.
    If I draw nigh to God,
    God will draw nigh to me.
    In God's Favour is Life, and
    In God's displeasure is Death.
    If I put off my Repentance to another day,
    I have a day more to Repent of,
    And a day, less to Repent in.
    Christ is a poor Sinners Hope.
    Christ's Blood is a Souls Ransom.
    To have a Portion in the World is a Mercy,
    But to have the World for a Portion is Misery.
    An Interest in Christ is the greatest Interest.
    The Love of God is sweeter than Wine,
    And better than Life.
    God's Ways are the best Ways,
    God's Peace is the best Peace, and
    God's People are the best People.
    The worst of the ways of GOD, are better than the
                                   best of the ways of Sin.
    'Tis better to suffer the greatest Suffering in the World,
    Than to sin the least Sin in the World.
    A poor Man is better than a Liar.
    Without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.



    IF I BE NOT Holy,
    Heaven cannot make me Happy.
    I must do the Lords-Work
    On the Lords-Day.
    If I want a Dram of Grace to Tame my Tongue,
    The time will come when I shall want a
          drop of Water to Cool my
                TONGUE.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
