A Day in Old Athens

By William Stearns Davis
Professor of Ancient History in the University of Minnesota





Preface




This little book tries to describe what an intelligent person would
see and hear in ancient Athens, if by some legerdemain he were
translated to the fourth century B.C. and conducted about the city
under competent guidance.  Rare happenings have been omitted and
sometimes, to avoid long explanations, PROBABLE matters have been
stated as if they were ascertained facts; but these instances are
few, and it is hoped no reader will be led into serious error.

The year 360 B.C. has been selected for the hypothetical time of
this visit, not because of any special virtue in that date, but
because Athens was then architecturally almost perfect, her civic
and her social life seemed at their best, the democratic constitution
held its vigor, and there were few outward signs of the general
decadence which was to set in after the triumph of Macedon.

I have endeavored to state no facts and to make no allusions, that
will not be fairly obvious to a reader who has merely an elementary
knowledge of Greek annals, such information, for instance, as may be
gained through a good secondary school history of ancient times.
This naturally has led to comments and descriptions which more
advanced students may find superfluous.

The writer has been under a heavy debt to the numerous and excellent
works on Greek "Private Antiquities" and "Public Life" written in
English, French, or German, as well as to the various great Classical
Encyclop√¶dias and Dictionaries, and to many treatises and monographs
upon the topography of Athens and upon the numerous phases of Attic
culture.  It is proper to say, however, that the material from
such secondary sources has been merely supplementary to a careful
examination of the ancient Greek writers, with the objects of this
book kept especially in view.  A sojourn in modern Athens, also,
has given me an impression of the influence of the Attic landscape
upon the conditions of old Athenian life, an impression that I have
tried to convey in this small volume.

I am deeply grateful to my sister, Mrs. Fannie Davis Gifford, for
helpful criticism of this book while in manuscript; to my wife,
for preparing the drawings from Greek vase-paintings which appear
as illustrations; and to my friend and colleague, Professor Charles
A. Savage, for a kind and careful reading of the proofs.  Thanks
also are due to Henry Holt and Company for permission to quote
material from their edition of Von Falke's "Greece and Rome."

A Day in Old Athens




Chapter I.  The Physical Setting of Athens.




1. The Importance of Athens in Greek History.--To three ancient
nations the men of the twentieth century owe an incalculable debt.
To the Jews we owe most of our notions of religion; to the Romans
we owe traditions and examples in law, administration, and the
general management of human affairs which still keep their influence
and value; and finally, to the Greeks we owe nearly all our ideas
as to the fundamentals of art, literature, and philosophy, in
fact, of almost the whole of our intellectual life.  These Greeks,
however, our histories promptly teach us, did not form a single
unified nation.  They lived in many "city-states" of more or less
importance, and some of the largest of these contributed very little
directly to our civilization.  Sparta, for example, has left us
some noble lessons in simple living and devoted patriotism, but
hardly a single great poet, and certainly never a philosopher or
sculptor.  When we examine closely, we see that the civilized life
of Greece, during the centuries when she was accomplishing the most,
was peculiarly centered at Athens.  Without Athens, Greek history
would lose three quarters of its significance, and modern life and
thought would become infinitely the poorer.


2. Why the Social Life of Athens is so Significant.--Because,
then, the contributions of Athens to our own life are so important,
because they touch (as a Greek would say) upon almost every side
of "the true, the beautiful, and the good," it is obvious that
the outward conditions under which this Athenian genius developed
deserve our respectful attention.  For assuredly such personages
as Sophocles, Plato, and Phidias were not isolated creatures, who
developed their genius apart from, or in spite of, the life about
them, but rather were the ripe products of a society, which in its
excellences and weaknesses presents some of the most interesting
pictures and examples in the world.  To understand the Athenian
civilization and genius it is not enough to know the outward history
of the times, the wars, the laws, and the lawmakers.  We must see
Athens as the average man saw it and lived in it from day to day,
and THEN perhaps we can partially understand how it was that during
the brief but wonderful era of Athenian freedom and prosperity[*],
Athens was able to produce so many men of commanding genius as to
win for her a place in the history of civilization which she can
never lose.

[*]That era may be assumed to begin with the battle of Marathon
(490 B.C.), and it certainly ended in 322 B.C., when Athens passed
decisively under the power of Macedonia; although since the battle
of Ch√¶roneia (338 B.C.) she had done little more than keep her
liberty on sufferance.


3. The Small Size and Sterility of Attica.--Attica was a very small
country according to modern notions, and Athens the only large city
therein.  The land barely covered some 700 square miles, with 40
square miles more, if one includes the dependent island of Salamis.
It was thus far smaller than the smallest of our American "states"
(Rhode Island = 1250 square miles), and was not so large as many
American counties.  It was really a triangle of rocky, hill-scarred
land thrust out into the √Ügean Sea, as if it were a sort of
continuation of the more level district of B≈ìotia. Yet small as it
was, the hills inclosing it to the west, the seas pressing it form
the northeast and south, gave it a unity and isolation all its own.
Attica was not an island; but it could be invaded only by sea, or
by forcing the resistance which could be offered at the steep mountain
passes towards B≈ìotia or Megara.  Attica was thus distinctly separated
from the rest of Greece.  Legends told how, when the half-savage
Dorians had forced themselves southward over the mainland, they
had never penetrated into Attica; and the Athenians later prided
themselves upon being no colonists from afar, but upon being
"earth-sprung,"--natives of the soil which they and their twenty-times
grandfathers had held before them.

This triangle of Attica had its peculiar shortcomings and virtues.
It was for the most part stony and unfertile.  Only a shallow layer
of good soil covered a part of its hard foundation rock, which
often in turn lay bare on the surface.  The Athenian farmer had a
sturdy struggle to win a scanty crop, and about the only products
he could ever raise in abundance for export were olives (which seemed
to thrive on scanty soil and scanty rainfall) and honey, the work
of the mountain bees.


4. The Physical Beauty of Attica.--Yet Attica had advantages which
more than counterbalanced this grudging of fertility.  All Greece,
to be sure, was favored by the natural beauty of its atmosphere,
seas, and mountains, but Attica was perhaps the most favored portion
of all, Around her coasts, rocky often and broken by pebbly beaches
and little craggy peninsulas, surged the deep blue √Ügean, the most
glorious expanse of ocean in the world.  Far away spread the azure
water[*],--often foam-crested and sometimes alive with the dolphins
leaping at their play,--reaching towards a shimmering sky line
where rose "the isles of Greece," masses of green foliage, or else
of tawny rock, scattered afar, to adapt the words of Homer, "like
shields laid on the face of the glancing deep."

[*]The peculiar blueness of the water near Attica is probably caused
by the clear rocky bottom of the sea, as well as by the intensity
of the sunlight.

Above the sea spread the noble arch of the heavens,--the atmosphere
often dazzlingly bright, and carrying its glamour and sparkle almost
into the hearts of men.  The Athenians were proud of the air about
their land.  Their poets gladly sung its praises, as, for example,
Euripides[*], when he tells how his fellow countrymen enjoy being--


Ever through air clear shining brightly
As on wings uplifted, pacing lightly.


[*]Medea:829.


5. The Mountains of Attica.--The third great element, besides the
sea and the atmosphere of Athens, was the mountains.  One after
another the bold hills reared themselves, cutting short all the
plainlands and making the farmsteads often a matter of slopes and
terraces.  Against the radiant heavens these mountains stood out
boldly, clearly; revealing all the little gashes and seams left from
that long-forgotten day when they were flung forth from the bowels
of the earth.  None of these mountains was very high:  Hymettus,
the greatest, was only about 3500 feet; but rising as they often
did from a close proximity to the sea, and not from a dwarfing
table-land, even the lower hills uplifted themselves with proud
majesty.

These hills were of innumerable tints according to their rocks,
the hue of the neighboring sea, and the hour of the day.  In spring
they would be clothed in verdant green, which would vanish before
the summer heats, leaving them rosy brown or gray.  But whatever
the fundamental tone, it was always brilliant; for the Athenians
lived in a land where blue sky, blue sea, and the massive rock blent
together into such a galaxy of shifting color, that, in comparison,
the lighting of almost any northern or western landscape would
seem feeble and tame.  The Athenians absorbed natural beauty with
their native air.


6. The Sunlight in Athens.--The Athenian loved sunshine, and Helios
the Sun God was gracious to his prayers.  In the Athens of to-day
it is reckoned that the year averages 179 days in which the sun is
not concealed by clouds one instant; and 157 days more when the sun
is not hidden more than half an hour[*].  Ancient Athens was surely
not more cloudy.  Nevertheless, despite this constant sunshine and
a southern latitude, Athens was stricken relatively seldom with
semitropical heat.  The sea was a good friend, bringing tempering
breezes.  In the short winter there might be a little frost, a
little snow, and a fair supply of rain.  For the rest of the year,
one golden day was wont to succeed another, with the sun and the
sea breeze in ever friendly rivalry.

[*]The reason for these many clear days is probably because when
the moist west and southwest winds come in contact with the dry,
heated air of the Attic plain, they are at once volatilized and
dispersed, not condensed (as in northern lands); therefore the day
resolves itself into brilliant sunshine.

The climate saved the Athenians from being obliged to wage a stern
warfare with nature as did the northern peoples.  Their life and
civilization could be one developed essentially "in the open air";
while, on the other hand, the bracing sea breeze saved them from
that enervating lethargy which has ruined so many southern folk.
The scanty soil forced them to struggle hard to win a living; unless
they yielded to the constant beckoning of the ocean, and sought
food, adventure, wealth, and a great empire across the seas.


7. The Topography of the City of Athens.--So much for the land of
Attica in general; but what of the setting of the city of Athens
itself?  The city lay in a plain, somewhat in the south central
part of Attica, and about four miles back from the sea.  A number
of mountains came together to form an irregular rectangle with the
Saronic Gulf upon the south.  To the east of Athens stretched the
long gnarled ridge of Hymettus, the wildest and grayest mountain
in Attica, the home of bees and goatherds, and (if there be faith
in pious legend) of innumerable nymphs and satyrs.  To the west
ran the lower, browner mountains, √Ügaleos, across which a road (the
"Sacred Way") wound through an easy pass towards Eleusis, the only
sizable town in Attica, outside of Athens and its harbors.  To the
rear of the plain rose a noble pyramid, less jagged than Hymettus,
more lordly than √Ügaleos; its summits were fretted with a white which
turned to clear rose color under the sunset.  This was Pentelicus,
from the veins whereof came the lustrous marble for the master
sculptor.  Closer at hand, nearer the center of the plain, rose
a small and very isolated hill,--Lycabettus, whose peaked summit
looked down upon the roofs of Athens.  And last, but never least,
about one mile southwest of Lycabettus, upreared a natural monument
of much greater frame,--not a hill, but a colossal rock.  Its
shape was that of an irregular oval; it was about 1000 feet long,
500 feet wide, and its level summit stood 350 feet above the plain.
This steep, tawny rock, flung by the Titans, one might dream,
into the midst of the Attic plain, formed one of the most famous
sites in the world, for it was the Acropolis of Athens.  Its full
significance, however, must be explained later.  From the Acropolis
and a few lesser hills close by, the land sloped gently down towards
the harbors and the Saronic Bay.

These were the great features of the outward setting of Athens.  One
might add to them the long belt of dark green olive groves winding
down the westward side of the plain, where the Cephisus (which
along among Attic rivulets did not run dry in summer) ran down to
the sea.  There was also a shorter olive belt west of the city,
where the weaker Ilissus crept, before it lost itself amid the
thirsty fields.

Sea, rock, and sky, then, joined together around Athens as around
almost no other city in the world.  The landscape itself was adjusted
to the eye with marvelous harmony.  The colors and contours formed
one glorious model for the sculptor and the painter, one perpetual
inspiration for the poet.  Even if Athens had never been the seat
of a famous race, she would have won fame as being situated in one
of the most beautiful localities in the world.  Rightly, therefore, did
its dwellers boast of their city as the "Violet-crowned" (Iostephanos).


8. 360 B.C.--The Year of the Visit to Athens.--This city let us
visit in the days of its greatest outward glory.  We may select the
year 360 B.C.  At that time Athens had recovered from the ravages
of the Peloponnesian War, while the Macedonian peril had not as
yet become menacing.  The great public buildings were nearly all
completed.  No signs of material decadence were visible, and if
Athens no longer possessed the wide naval empire of the days of
Pericles, her fleets and her armies were still formidable.  The
harbors were full of commerce; the philosophers were teaching their
pupils in the groves and porticoes; the democratic constitution was
entirely intact.  With intelligent vision we will enter the city
and look about us.





Chapter II.  The First Sights in Athens.




9. The Morning Crowds bound for Athens.--It is very early in the
morning.  The sun has just pushed above the long ridge of Hymettus,
sending a slanting red bar of light across the Attic plain, and
touching the opposite slopes of √Ügaleos with livid fire.  Already,
however, life is stirring outside the city.  Long since, little
market boats have rowed across the narrow strait from Salamis,
bringing the island farmer's produce, and other farmers from the
plain and the mountain slopes have started for market.  In the
ruddy light the marble temples on the lofty Acropolis rising ahead
of these hurrying rustics are standing out clearly; the spear
and helmet of the great brazen statue of the Athena Promachos are
flashing from the noble citadel, as a kind of day beacon, beckoning
onward toward the city.  From the Peir√¶us, the harbor town, a
confused him of mariners lading and unlading vessels is even now
rising, but we cannot turn ourselves thither.  Our route is to
follow the farmers bound for market.

The most direct road from the Peir√¶us to Athens is hidden indeed,
for it leads between the towering ramparts of the "Long Walls,"
two mighty barriers which run parallel almost four miles from the
inland city to the harbor, giving a guarded passage in wartime and
making Athens safe against starvation from any land blockade; but
there is an outside road leading also to Athens from the western
farmsteads, and this we can conveniently follow.  Upon this route
the crowd which one meets is certainly not aristocratic, but it
is none the less Athenian.  Here goes a drover, clad in skins, his
legs wound with woolen bands in lieu of stockings; before him and
his wolf-like dog shambles a flock of black sheep or less manageable
goats, bleating and baaing as they are propelled toward market.
After him there may come an unkempt, long-bearded farmer flogging on
a pack ass or a mule attached to a clumsy cart with solid wheels,
and laden with all kinds of market produce.  The roadway, be it
said, is not good, and all carters have their troubles; therefore,
there is a deal of gesticulating and profane invocation of Hermes
and all other gods of traffic; for, early as it is, the market
place is already filling, and every delay promises a loss.  There
are still other companions bound toward the city:  countrymen
bearing cages of poultry; others engaged in the uncertain calling
of driving pigs; swarthy Oriental sailors, with rings in their
ears, bearing bales of Ph≈ìnician goods from the Peir√¶us; respectable
country gentlemen, walking gravely in their best white mantles
and striving to avoid the mud and contamination; and perhaps also
a small company of soldiers, just back from foreign service, passes,
clattering shields and spear staves.


10. The Gate and the Street Scenes.--The crowds grow denser
as everybody approaches the frequented "Peir√¶us Gate," for nearly
all of Attica which lies within easy reach of Athens has business
in the Market Place every morning.  On passing the gate a fairly
straight way leads through the city to the market, but progress for
the multitude becomes slow.  If it is one of the main thoroughfares,
it is now very likely to be almost blocked with people.  There are
few late risers at Athens; the Council of Five Hundred[*], the huge
Jury Courts, and the Public Assembly (if it has met to-day[+]) are
appointed to gather at sunrise.  The plays in the theater, which,
however, are given only on certain festivals, begin likewise at
sunrise.  The philosophers say that "the man who would accomplish
great things must be up while yet it is dark."  Athenians, therefore,
are always awake and stirring at an hour when men of later ages and
more cold and foggy climes will be painfully yawning ere getting
out of bed.

[*]The "Boule," the great standing committee of the Athenian people
to aid the magistrates in the government.

[+]In which case, of course, the regular courts and the Council
would hardly meet.

The Market Place attracts the great masses, but by no means all;
hither and thither bevies of sturdy slave girls, carrying graceful
pitchers on their heads, are hurrying towards the fountains which
gush cool water at most of the street corners.  Theirs is a highly
necessary task, for few or no houses have their own water supply;
and around each fountain one can see half a dozen by no means
slatternly maidens, splashing and flirting the water one at another,
while they wait their turn with the pitchers, and laugh and exchange
banter with the passing farmers' lads.  Many in the street crowds
are rosy-cheeked schoolboys, walking decorously, if they are lads
of good breeding, and blushing modestly when they are greeted
by their fathers' acquaintances.  They do not loiter on the way.
Close behind, carrying their writing tablets, follow the faithful
'pedagogues,' the body-servants appointed to conduct them to
school, give them informal instruction, and, if need be, correct
their faults in no painless manner.  Besides the water maids
and the schoolboys, from the innumerable house doors now opening
the respective masters are stepping forth--followed by one, two,
or several serving varlets, as many as their wealth affords.  All
these join in the crowd entering from the country.  "Athenian
democracy" always implies a goodly amount of hustling and pushing.
No wonder the ways are a busy sight!


11. The Streets and House Fronts of Athens.--Progress is slower near
the Market Place because of the extreme narrowness of the streets.
They are only fifteen feet wide or even less,--intolerable alleys
a later age would call them,--and dirty to boot.  Sometimes they
are muddy, more often extremely dusty.  Worse still, they are
contaminated by great accumulations of filth; for the city is without
an efficient sewer system or regular scavengers.  Even as the crowd
elbows along, a house door will frequently open, an ill-favored
slave boy show his head, and with the yell, "Out of the way!" slap
a bucket of dirty water into the street.  There are many things to
offend the nose as well as the eyes of men of a later race.  It is
fortunate indeed that the Athenians are otherwise a healthy folk,
or they would seem liable to perpetual pestilence; even so, great
plagues have in past years harried the city[*].

[*]The most fearful thereof was the great plague of 430 B.C. (during
the Peloponnesian War), which nearly ruined Athens.

The first entrance to Athens will thus bring to a stranger, full of
the city's fame and expectant of meeting objects of beauty at every
turn, almost instant disappointment.  The narrow, dirty, ill-paved
streets are also very crooked.  One can readily be lost in a
labyrinth of filthy little lanes the moment one quits the few main
thoroughfares.  High over head, to be sure, the red crags of the
Acropolis may be towering, crowned with the red, gold, and white
tinted marble of the temples, but all around seems only monotonous
squalor.  The houses seem one continuous series of blank walls;
mostly of one, occasionally of two stories, and with flat roofs.
These walls are usually spread over with some dirty gray or perhaps
yellow stucco.  For most houses, the only break in the street walls
are the simple doors, all jealously barred and admitting no glance
within.  There are usually no street windows, if the house is only
one story high.  If it has two stories, a few narrow slits above
the way may hint that here are the apartments for the slaves or
women.  There are no street numbers.  There are often no street
names.  "So-and-so lives in such-and-such a quarter, near the
Temple of Heracles;" that will enable you to find a householder,
after a few tactful questions from the neighbors; and after all,
Athens is a relatively small city[*] (as great cities are reckoned),
very closely built, and her regular denizens do not feel the need
of a directory.

[*]Every guess at the population of Athens rests on mere conjecture;
yet, using the scanty data which we possess, it seems possible
that THE POPULATION OF ALL ATTICA at the height of its prosperity
was about 200,000 FREE PERSONS (including the METICS--resident
foreigners without citizenship); and a rather smaller number of
slaves--say 150,000 or less.  Of this total of some 350,000, probably
something under one half resided in the city of Athens during times
of peace, the rest in the outlying farms and villages.  ATHENS MAY
BE IMAGINED AS A CITY OF ABOUT 150,000--possibly a trifle more.
During serious wars there would be of course a general removal into
the city.

So the crowd elbows its way onward:  now thinning, now gaining,
but the main stream always working towards the Market Place.



12.  The Simplicity of Athenian Life.--It is clear we are entering
a city where nine tenths of what the twentieth century will consider
the "essential conveniences" of life are entirely lacking; where
men are trying to be civilized--or, as the Greeks would say, to lay
hold upon "the true, the beautiful, and the good," without even the
absolute minimum of those things which people of a later age will
believe separate a "civilized man" from a "barbarian."  The gulf
between old Athens and, for instance, new Chicago is greater than
is readily supposed[*].  It is easy enough to say that the Athenians
lacked such things as railways, telephones, gas, grapefruit,
and cocktails.  All such matters we realize were not known by our
fathers and grandfathers, and we are not yet so removed from THEM
that we cannot transport ourselves in imagination back to the
world of say 1820 A.D.; but the Athenians are far behind even our
grandfathers.  When we investigate, we will find conditions like
these--houses absolutely without plumbing, beds without sheets,
rooms as hot or as cold as the outer air, only far more drafty.  We
must cross rivers without bridges; we must fasten our clothes (or
rather our "two pieces of cloth") with two pins instead of with
a row of buttons; we must wear sandals without stockings (or go
barefoot); must warm ourselves over a pot of ashes; judge plays or
lawsuits on a cold winter morning sitting in the open air; we must
study poetry with very little aid from books, geography without
real maps, and politics without newspapers; and lastly, "we must
learn how to be civilized without being comfortable!"[+]

[*]See the very significant comment on the physical limitations
of the old Athenian life in Zimmern's "The Greek Commonwealth," p.
209.

[+]Zimmern, ibid.

Or, to reverse the case:  we must understand that an Athenian would
have pronounced our boasted "civilization" hopelessly artificial,
and our life so dependent on outward material props and factors
as to be scarcely worth the living.  He would declare himself well
able to live happily under conditions where the average American
or Englishman would be cold, semi-starved, and miserable.  He would
declare that HIS woe or happiness was retained far more under his own
control than we retain ours, and that we are worthy of contemptuous
pity rather than of admiration, because we have refined our
civilization to such a point that the least accident, e.g. the
suspension of rail traffic for a few days, can reduce a modern city
to acute wretchedness.

Probably neither the twentieth century in its pride, nor the fourth
century B.C. in its contempt, would have all the truth upon its
side.[*]  The difference in viewpoint, however, must still stand.
Pre√´minently Athens may be called the "City of the Simple Life."
Bearing this fact in mind, we may follow the multitude and enter
the Marketplace; or, to use the name that stamps it as a peculiarly
Greek institution,--the Agora.

[*]The mere matter of CLIMATE would of course have to come in as
a serious factor.  The Athenian would have found his life becoming
infinitely more complex along the material side when he tried
to live like a "kalos-k'agathos"--i.e. a "noble and good man," or
a "gentleman,"--in a land where the thermometer might sink to 15¬∞
below zero Fahrenheit (or even lower) from time to time during the
winter.





Chapter III.  The Agora and its Denizens.




13.  The Buildings around the Agora.--Full market time![*]  The great
plaza of the Agora is buzzing with life.  The contrast between the
dingy, dirty streets and this magnificent public plaza is startling.
The Athenians manifestly care little for merely private display,
rather they frown upon it; their wealth, patriotism, and best
artistic energy seem all lavished upon their civic establishments
and buildings.

[*]Between nine and twelve A.M.

The Agora is a square of spacious dimensions, planted here and
there with graceful bay trees.  Its greatest length runs north and
south.  Ignoring for the time the teeming noisy swarms of humanity,
let our eyes be directed merely upon the encircling buildings.  The
place is almost completely enclosed by them, although not all are
of equal elegance or pretension.  Some are temples of more or less
size, like the temple of the "Paternal Apollo" near the southwestern
angle; or the "Metro√∂n," the fane of Cybele "the Great Mother
of the Gods," upon the south.  Others are governmental buildings;
somewhat behind the Metro√∂n rise the imposing pillars of the Council
House, where the Five Hundred are deliberating on the policy of
Athens; and hard by that is the Tholos, the "Round House," with a
peaked, umbrella-shaped roof, beneath which the sacred public hearth
fire is ever kept burning, and where the presiding Committee of
the Council[*] and certain high officials take their meals, and a
good deal of state business is transacted.  The majority of these
buildings upon the Agora, however, are covered promenades, porticoes,
or sto√¶.

[*]This select committee was known technically as the "Prytanes."

The sto√¶ are combinations of rain shelters, shops, picture galleries,
and public offices.  Turn under the pillars of the "Royal Stoa"
upon the west, and you are among the whispering, nudging, intent
crowd of listeners, pushing against the barriers of a low court.
Long rows of jurors are sitting on their benches; the "King Archon"
is on the president's stand, and some poor wight is being arraigned
on a charge of "Impiety"[*]; while on the walls behind stand graved
and ancient laws of Draco and Solon.

[*]The so-called "King Archon" had special cognizance of most cases
involving religious questions; and his court was in this stoa.

Cross the square, and on the opposite side is one of the most
magnificent of the porticoes, the "Painted Porch" ("Stoa Poikil√´"),
a long covered walk, a delightful refuge alike from sun and rain.
Almost the entire length of the inner walls (for it has columns
only on the side of the Agora) is covered with vivid frescoes.  Here
Polygnotus and other master painters have spread out the whole
legendary story of the capture of Troy and of the defeat of the
Amazons; likewise the more historical tale of the battle of Marathon.
Yet another promenade, the "Stoa of Zeus," is sacred to Zeus, Giver
of Freedom.  The walls are not frescoed, but hung with the shields
of valiant Athenian warriors.

In the open spaces of the plaza itself are various alters, e.g. to
the "Twelve Gods," and innumerable statues of local worthies, as
of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, the tyrant-slayers; while across the
center, cutting the Market Place from east to west, runs a line of
stone posts, each surmounted with a rude bearded head of Hermes,
the trader's god; and each with its base plastered many times over
with all kinds of official and private placards and notices.


14.  The Life in the Agora.--So much for the physical setting of
the Agora:  of far greater interest surely are the people.  The
whole square is abounding with noisy activity.  If an Athenian has
no actual business to transact, he will at least go to the Agora
to get the morning news.  Two turns under the "Painted Porch" will
tell him the last rumor as to the foreign policy of Thebes;  whether
it is true that old King Agesilaus has died at Sparta; whether corn
is likely to be high, owning to a failure of crops in the Euxine
(Black Sea) region; whether the "Great King" of Persia is prospering
in his campaign against Egypt.  The crowd is mostly clad in white,
though often the cloaks of the humbler visitors are dirty, but there
is a sprinkling of gay colors,--blue, orange, and pink.  Everybody
is talking at once in melodious Attic; everybody (since they are
all true children of the south) is gesticulating at once.  To the
babel of human voices is added the wheezing whistle of donkeys,
the squealing of pigs, the cackle of poultry.  Besides, from many
of the little factories and workshops on or near the Agora a great
din is rising.  The clamor is prodigious.  Criers are stalking
up and down the square, one bawling out that Andocides has lost a
valuable ring and will pay well to recover it; another the Pheidon
has a desirable horse that he will sell cheap.  One must stand
still for some moments and let eye and ear accustom themselves to
such utter confusion.


15.  The Booths and Shops in the Agora.--At length out of the chaos
there seems to emerge a certain order.  The major part of the square
is covered with little booths of boards and wicker work, very frail
and able to be folded up, probably every night.  There are little
lanes winding amid these booths; and each manner of huckster has
its own especial "circle" or section of the market.  "Go to the
wine," "to the fish," "to the myrtles" (i.e. the flowers), are
common directions for finding difficult parts of the Agora.  Trade
is mostly on a small scale,--the stock of each vendor is distinctly
limited in its range, and Athens is without "department stores."  Behind
each low counter, laden with its wares, stands the proprietor, who
keeps up a din from leathern lungs:  "Buy my oil!"  "Buy charcoal!"
"Buy sausage!" etc., until he is temporarily silenced while dealing
with a customer.

In one "circle" may be found onions and garlic (a favorite food
of the poor); a little further on are the dealers in wine, fruit,
and garden produce.  Lentils and peas can be had either raw, or
cooked and ready to eat on the spot.  An important center is the
bread market.  The huge cylindrical loaves are handed out by shrewd
old women with proverbially long tongues.  Whosoever upsets one of
their delicately balanced piles of loaves is certain of an artistic
tongue lashing.  Elsewhere there is a pottery market, a clothes
market, and, nearer the edge of the Agora, are "circles," where
objects of real value are sold, like jewelry, chariots, good
furniture.  In certain sections, too, may be seen strong-voiced
individuals, with little trays swung by straps before them, pacing
to and fro, and calling out, not foods, but medicines, infallible
cure-alls for every human distemper.  Many are the unwary fools
who patronize them.


16.  The Flower and the Fish Vendors.--Two circles attract especial
attention, the Myrtles and the Fish.  Flowers and foliage, especially
when made up into garlands, are absolutely indispensable to the
average Greek.  Has he a great family festival, e.g. the birth
of a son, then every guest should wear a crown of olives; is it a
wedding, then one of flowers.[*]  Oak-leaves do the honors for Zeus;
laurel for Apollo; myrtle for Aphrodite (and is not the Love-Goddess
the favorite?).  To have a social gathering without garlands, in
short, is impossible.  The flower girls of Athens are beautiful,
impudent, and not at all prudish.  Around their booths press
bold-tongued youths, and not too discreet sires; and the girls can
call everybody familiarly by name.  Very possibly along with the
sale of the garlands they make arrangements (if the banquet is
to be of the less respectable kind) to be present in the evening
themselves, perhaps in the capacity of flute girls.

[*]The Greeks lacked many of our common flowers.  Their ordinary
flowers were white violets, narcissus, lilies, crocuses, blue
hyacinths, and roses ("the Flower of Zeus").  The usual garland
was made of myrtle or ivy and then entwined with various flowers.

More reputable, though not less noisy, is the fish market.  Athenians
boast themselves of being no hearty "meat eaters" like their B≈ìotian
neighbors, but of preferring the more delicate fish.  No dinner
party is successful without a seasonable course of fish.  The arrival
of a fresh cargo from the harbor is announced by the clanging of
a bell, which is likely to leave all the other booths deserted,
while a crowd elbows around the fishmonger.  He above all others
commands the greatest flow of billingsgate, and is especially notorious
for his arrogant treatment of his customers, and for exacting the
uttermost farthing.  The "Fish" and the "Myrtles" can be sure of
a brisk trade on days when all the other booth keepers around the
Agora stand idle.

All this trade, of course, cannot find room in the booths of the
open Agora.  Many hucksters sit on their haunches on the level
ground with their few wares spread before them.  Many more have
little stands between the pillars of the sto√¶; and upon the various
streets that converge on the market there is a fringe of shops,
but these are usually of the more substantial sort.  Here are the
barbers' shops, the physicians' offices (if the good leech is more
than an itinerant quack), and all sorts of little factories, such
as smithies, where the cutler's apprentices in the rear of the shop
forge the knives which the proprietor sells over the counter, the
slave repositories, and finally wine establishments of no high
repute, where wine may not merely be bought by the skin (as in the
main Agora), but by the potful to be drunk on the premises.


17.  The Morning Visitors to the Agora.--The first tour of inspection
completed, several facts become clear to the visitor.  One is the
extraordinarily large proportion of MEN among the moving multitudes.
Except for the bread women and the flower girls, hardly one female
is to be found among the sellers.  Among the purchasers there is
not a single reputable lady.  No Athenian gentlewoman dreams of
frequenting the Agora.  Even a poor man's wife prefers to let her
spouse do the family marketing.  As for the "men folk," the average
gentleman will go daily indeed to the Agora, but if he is really
pretentious, it will be merely to gossip and to meet his friends;
a trusted servant will attend to the regular purchasing.  Only when
an important dinner party is on hand will the master take pains to
order for himself.  If he does purchase in person, he will never
CARRY anything himself.  The slaves can attend to that; and only
the slaveless (the poorest of all) must take away their modest
rations of boiled lentils, peas, beans, onions, and garlic, usually
in baskets, though yonder now is a soldier who is bearing off a
measure of boiled peas inside his helmet.

Another thing is striking.  The average poor Athenian seems to
have no purse.  Or rather he uses the purse provided by nature.  At
every booth one can see unkempt buyers solemnly taking their small
change from their mouths.[*]  Happy the people that has not learned
the twentieth century wisdom concerning microbes!  For most Athenians
seem marvelously healthy.

[*]A wealthier purchaser would, of course, have his own pouch, or
more probably one carried for him by a slave.

Still one other fact is brought home constantly.  "Fixed prices"
are absolutely unknown.  The slightest transaction involves a war of
bargaining.  Wits are matched against wits, and only after a vast
deal of wind do buyer and seller reach a fair compromise.  All
this makes retail trade in the Agora an excellent school for public
affairs or litigation.


18.  The Leisured Class in Athens.--Evidently Athens, more than
many later-day cities, draws clear lines between the workers and the
"gentlemen of leisure."  There is no distinction of dress between
the numerous slaves and the humbler free workers and traders; but
there is obvious distinction between the artisan of bent shoulders
who shambles out of yonder pungent tannery, with his scant garments
girded around him, and the graceful gentleman of easy gestures
and flowing drapery who moves towards the Tholos.  There is great
POLITICAL democracy in Athens, but not so much SOCIAL democracy.
"Leisure," i.e. exemption from every kind of sordid, money-getting,
hard work, is counted the true essential for a respectable existence,
and to live on the effort of others and to devote oneself to public
service or to letters and philosophy is the open satisfaction or
the private longing of every Athenian.

A great proportion of these, therefore, who frequent the Agora are
not here on practical business, unless they have official duties
at the government offices.[*]  But in no city of any age has the
gracious art of doing nothing been brought to such perfection.
The Athenians are an intensely gregarious people.  Everybody knows
everybody else.  Says an orator, "It is impossible for a man to
be either a rascal or an honest man in this city without your all
knowing it."  Few men walk long alone; if they do keep their own
company, they are frowned on as "misanthropes."  The morning visit
to the Agora "to tell or to hear some new thing"[+] will be followed
by equally delightful idling and conversation later in the day at
the Gymnasia, and later still, probably, at the dinner-party.  Easy
and unconventional are the personal greetings.  A little shaking
out of the mantle, an indescribable flourish with the hands.  A
free Greek will despise himself for "bowing," even to the Great
King.  To clasp hands implies exchanging a pledge, something for
more than mere salutation.

"Chaire, Aristomenes!"

"Chaire, Cleandros!"

Such is the usual greeting, using an expressive word which can mean
equally well "hail!" and "farewell!"

[*]To serve the state in any official capacity (usually without any
salary attached to the office) would give the highest satisfaction
to any Greek.  The desire for participation in public affairs might
be described as a mania.

[+]Acts of the Apostles, 17:21.


19.  Familiar Types around the Agora.--These animated, eager-faced
men whose mantles fall in statuesque folds prefer obviously to walk
under the Painted Porch, or the blue roof of heaven, while they
evolve their philosophies, mature their political schemes, or
organize the material for their orations and dramas, rather than to
bend over desks within close offices.  Around the Athenian Agora,
a true type of this preference, and busy with this delightful
idleness, half a century earlier could have been seen a droll
figure with "indescribable nose, bald head, round body, eyes rolling
and twinkling with good humor," scantily clad,--an incorrigible
do-nothing, windbag, and hanger-on, a later century might assert,--yet
history has given to him the name of Socrates.

Not all Athenians, of course, make such justifiable use of their
idleness.  There are plenty of young men parading around in long
trailing robes, their hair oiled and curled most effeminately,
their fingers glittering with jewels,--"ring-loaded, curly-locked
coxcombs," Aristophanes, the comic poet, has called them,--and
they are here only for silly display.  Also there are many of their
elders who have no philosophy or wit to justify their continuous
talking; nevertheless, all considered, it must be admitted that
the Athenian makes a use of their dearly loved "leisure," which
men of a more pragmatic race will do well to consider as the fair
equivalent of much frantic zeal for "business."  Athenian "leisure" has
already given the world Pericles, Thucydides, √Üschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, Socrates, and Plato, not to name such artists as Phidias,
whose profession cannot exempt them from a certain manual occupation.


20.  The Barber Shops.--This habit of genteel idleness naturally
develops various peculiar institutions.  For example, the barber
shops are almost club rooms.  Few Hellenes at this time shave their
beards[*], but to go with unkempt whiskers and with too long hair
is most disgraceful.  The barber shops, booths, or little rooms let
into the street walls of the houses, are therefore much frequented.
The good tonsors have all the usual arts.  They can dye gray hair
brown or black; they can wave or curl their patrons' locks (and
an artificially curled head is no disgrace to a man).  Especially,
they keep a good supply of strong perfumes; for many people will
want a little scent on their hair each morning, even if they wish
no other attention.  But it is not an imposition to a barber to
enter his shop, yet never move towards his low stool before the
shining steel mirror.  Anybody is welcome to hang around indefinitely,
listening to the proprietor's endless flow of talk.  He will pride
himself on knowing every possible bit of news or rumor:  Had the
Council resolved on a new fleet-building program?  Had the Tyrant
of Syracuse's "four" the best chance in the chariot race in the
next Olympic games?  The garrulity of barbers is already proverbial.

[*] Alexander the Great (336-323 B.C.) required his soldiers to be
shaved (as giving less grasp for the enemy!), and the habit then
spread generally through the whole Hellenic world.

"How shall I cut your hair, sir?" once asked the court tonsure of
King Archel√§us of Macedon.

"In silence," came the grim answer.

But the proprietor will not do all the talking.  Everybody in the
little room will join.  Wits will sharpen against wits; and if the
company is of a grave and respectable sort, the conversation will
grow brisk upon Plato's theory of the "reality of ideas," upon
Euripides's interpretation of the relations of God to man, or upon
the spiritual symbolism of Scopas's bas-reliefs at Halicarnassus.

The barber shops by the Agora then are essential portions of
Athenian social life.  Later we shall see them supplemented by the
Gymnasia;--but the Agora has detained us long enough.  The din and
crowds are lessening.  People are beginning to stream homeward.
It lacks a little of noon according to the "time-staff" (gnomon),
a simple sun dial which stands near one of the porticoes, and we
will now follow some Athenian gentleman towards his dwelling.





Chapter IV.  The Athenian House and its Furnishings.




21.  Following an Athenian Gentleman Homeward.--Leaving the Agora
and re√´ntering the streets the second impression of the residence
districts becomes more favorable.  There are a few bay trees planted
from block to block; and ever and anon the monotonous house walls
recede, giving space to display some temple, like the Fane of
Heph√¶stos[*] near the Market Place, its columns and pediment flashing
not merely with white marble, but with the green, scarlet, and gold
wherewith the Greeks did not hesitate to decorate their statuary.

[*]Wrongly called the "Theseum" in modern Athens.

At street corners and opposite important mansions a Hermes-bust
like those in the plaza rises, and a very few houses have a couple
of pillars at their entrances and some outward suggestion of hidden
elegance.

We observe that almost the entire crowd leaving the Agora goes
on foot.  To ride about in a chariot is a sign of undemocratic
presumption; while only women or sick men will consent to be borne
in a litter.  We will select a sprucely dressed gentleman who has
just been anointed in a barber's shop and accompany him to his home.
He is neither one of the decidedly rich, otherwise his establishment
would be exceptional, not typical, nor is he of course one of
the hard-working poor.  Followed by perhaps two clean and capable
serving lads, he wends his way down several of the narrow lanes that
lie under the northern brow of the Acropolis[*].  Before a plain
solid house door he halts and cries, "Pai!  Pai!" ["Boy!  Boy!"].
There is a rattle of bolts and bars.  A low-visaged foreign-born
porter, whose business it is to show a surly front to all unwelcome
visitors, opens and gives a kind of salaam to his master; while
the porter's huge dog jumps up barking and pawing joyously.

[*]This would be a properly respectable quarter of the city, but
we do not know of any really "aristocratic residence district" in
Athens.

As we enter behind him (carefully advancing with right foot foremost,
for it is bad luck to tread a threshold with the LEFT) we notice
above the lintel some such inscription as "Let no evil enter here!"
or "To the Good Genius," then a few steps through a narrow passage
bring us into the Aula, the central court, the indispensable feature
of every typical Greek house.


22.  The Type and use of a Greek House.--All domestic architecture,
later investigators will discover, falls into two great categories--of
the northern house and the southern house.  The northern house begins
with a single large room, "the great hall," then lesser rooms are
added to it.  It gets its light from windows in the outer walls,
and it is covered by a single steep roof.  The southern (Greek and
Oriental) house is a building inclosing a rectangular court.  The
rooms, many or few, get their light from this court, while they
are quite shut off from the world outside.  All in all, for warm
climates this style of house is far more airy, cool, comfortable
than the other.  The wide open court becomes the living room of
the house save in very inclement weather.

Socrates is reported to have uttered what was probably the average
sensible view about a good house.[*]  The good house, he thought,
should be cool in summer, and warm in winter, convenient for the
accommodation of the family and its possessions.  The central rooms
should therefore be lofty and should open upon the south, yet for
protection in summer there should be good projecting eaves (over
the court) and again the rooms on the northern exposure should be
made lower.  All this is mere sense, but really the average male
Athenian does not care a great deal about his dwelling.  He spends
surprisingly little money beautifying it.  Unless he is sick, he
will probably be at home only for sleeping and eating.  The Agora,
the Public Assembly, the Jury Courts, the Gymnasium, the great
religious festivals consume his entire day.  "I never spend my time
indoors," says Xenophon's model Athenian, "my wife is well able
to run the household by herself."[+]  Such being the case, even
wealthy men have very simple establishments, although it is at length
complained (e.g. by Demosthenes) that people are now building more
luxurious houses, and are not content with the plain yet sufficient
dwellings of the great age of Pericles.[@]

[*]In Xenophon's "Memorabilia," III. 8, ¬ß¬ß 9,10.

[+]Xenophon, "Economics," VII. 3.

[@]Very probably in such outlying Greek cities as Syracuse, Taras
(Tarentum), etc., more elegant houses could be found than any at
this time in Athens.


23.  The Plan of a Greek House.--The plan of a Greek house naturally
varies infinitely according to the size of the land plot, the size
of the owner's family, his own taste, and wealth.  It will usually
be rectangular, with the narrower side toward the street; but this
is not invariable.  In the larger houses there will be two courts
(aul√¶), one behind the other, and each with its own circuit of
dependent chambers.  The court first entered will be the Andronitis
(the Court of the Men), and may be even large enough to afford a
considerable promenade for exercise.  Around the whole of the open
space run lines of simple columns, and above the opening swings an
awning if the day is very hot.  In the very center rises a small
stone alter with a statue of Zeus the Protector (Zeus Herke√Øos),
where the father of the family will from time to time offer sacrifice,
acting as the priest for the household.  Probably already on the
alter there has been laid a fresh garland; if not, the newcomers
from the Agora have now fetched one.

The Andronitis is the true living room of the house:  here the
master will receive his visitors, here the male slaves will work,
and the women also busy themselves (promptly retiring, however,
on the appearance of masculine strangers).  The decoration is very
plain:  the walls are neatly tinted with some kind of wash; the
floor is of simple plaster, or, in a humbler house, common earth
pounded hard.  Under the colonnade at all four sides open the
various chambers, possibly twelve in all.  They really are cells
or compartments rather than rooms, small and usually lighted only
by their doors.  Some are used for storerooms, some for sleeping
closets for the male slaves and for the grown-up sons of the
house, if there are any.  Dark, ill ventilated, and most scantily
furnished, it is no wonder that the average Athenian loves the
Agora better than his chamber.

The front section of the house is now open to us, but it is time
to penetrate farther.  Directly behind the open court is a sizable
chamber forming a passage to the inner house.  This chamber is the
Andron, the dining hall and probably the most pretentious room in
the house.  Here the guests will gather for the dinner party, and
here in one corner smokes the family hearth, once the real fire for
the whole household cooking, but now merely a symbol of the domestic
worship.  It is simply a little round alter sacred to Hestia, the
hearth goddess,[*] and on its duly rekindled flame little "meat
offerings and drink offerings" are cast at every meal, humble or
elaborate.

[*]Who corresponds to the Roman goddess Vesta.

In the rear wall of the Andron facing the Andronitis is a solid
door.  We are privileged guests indeed if we pass it.  Only the
father, sons, or near male kinsmen of the family are allowed to go
inside, for it leads into the Gyn√¶conitis, the hall of the women.
To thrust oneself into the Gyn√¶conitis of even a fairly intimate
friend is a studied insult at Athens, and sure to be resented by
bodily chastisement, social ostracism, and a ruinous legal prosecution.
The Gyn√¶conitis is in short the Athenian's holy of holies.  Their
women are forbidden to participate in so much of public life that
their own peculiar world is especially reserved to them.  To invade
this world is not bad breeding; it is social sacrilege.

In the present house, the home of a well-to-do family, the Gyn√¶conitis
forms a second pillared court with adjacent rooms of substantially
the same size and shape as the Andronitis.  One of the rooms in
the very rear is proclaimed by the clatter of pots and pans and
the odor of a frying turbot to be the kitchen; others are obviously
the sleeping closets of the slave women.  On the side nearest to
the front of the house, but opening itself upon this inner court,
is at least one bed chamber of superior size.  This is the Thalamos,
the great bedroom of the master and mistress, and here are kept all
the most costly furnishings and ornaments in the house.  If there
are grown-up unmarried daughters, they have another such bedroom
(anti-thalamos) that is much larger than the cells of the slave
girls.  Another special room is set apart for the working of wool,
although this chief occupation of the female part of the household
is likely to be carried on in the open inner court itself, if the
weather is fine.  Here, around a little flower bed, slave girls
are probably spinning and embroidering, young children playing or
quarreling, and a tame quail is hopping about and watching for a
crumb.  There are in fact a great many people in a relatively small
space; everything is busy, chattering, noisy, and confusing to an
intruding stranger.

24.  Modifications in the Typical Plan.--These are the essential
features of an Athenian house.  If the establishment is a very
pretentious one, there may be a small garden in the rear carefully
hedged against intruders by a lofty wall.[*]  More probably the
small size of the house lot would force simplifications in the
scheme already stated.  In a house one degree less costly, the
Gyn√¶conitis would be reduced to a mere series of rooms shut off in
the rear.  In more simple houses still there would be no interior
section of the house at all.  The women of the family would be
provided for by a staircase rising from the main hall to a second
story, and here a number of upper chambers would give the needful
seclusion.[+]  Of course as one goes down the social scale, the
houses grow simpler and simpler.  Small shops are set into the
street wall at either side of the entrance door, and on entering
one finds himself in a very limited and utterly dingy court with
a few dirty compartments opening thence, which it would be absurd
to dignify by the name of "rooms."  Again one ceases to wonder
that the male Athenians are not "home folk" and are glad to leave
their houses to the less fortunate women!

[*]Such a luxury would not be common in city houses; land would be
too valuable.

[+]Houses of more than two stories seem to have been unknown
in Athens.  The city lacked the towering rookeries of tenements
(insul√¶) which were characteristic of Rome; sometimes, however, a
house seems to have been shared between several families.


25.  Rents and House Values.--Most native Athenians own their houses.
Houses indeed can be rented, usually by the foreign traders and
visitors who swam into the city; and at certain busy seasons one can
hire "lodgings" for a brief sojourn.  Rents are not unreasonable,
8% or 8 1/3% of the value of the house being counted a fair annual
return.  But the average citizen is also a householder, because
forsooth houses are very cheap.  The main cost is probably for
the land.  The chief material used in building, sun-dried brick,
is very unsubstantial,[*] and needs frequent repairs, but is
not expensive.  Demosthenes the Orator speaks of a "little house"
(doubtless of the kind last described) worth only seven minu√¶ [about
$126.00 (1914) or $2,242.80 (2000)], and this is not the absolute
minimum.  A very rich banker has had one worth 100 minu√¶ [about
$1,800.00 (1914) or $32,040.00 (2000)], and probably this is close
to the maximum.  The rent question is not therefore one of the
pressing problems at Athens.

[*]This material was so friable and poor that the Greek burglar
was known as a "Wall-digger."  It did not pay him to pick a lock;
it was simpler for him to quarry his way through the wall with a
pickax.


26.  The Simple yet Elegant Furnishings of an Athenian Home.--These
houses, even owned by the lordly rich, are surprisingly simple
in their furnishings.  The accumulation of heavy furniture, wall
decorations, and bric-a-brac which will characterize the dwellings
of a later age, would be utterly offensive to an Athenian--contradicting
all his ideas of harmony and "moderation."  The Athenian house
lacks of course bookcases and framed pictures.  It probably too
lacks any genuine closets.  Beds, couches, chairs (usually backless),
stools, footstools, and small portable tables,--these alone seem
in evidence.  In place of bureaus, dressers and cupboards, there
are huge chests, heavy and carved, in which most of the household
gear can be locked away.  In truth, the whole style of Greek
household life expresses that simplicity on which we have already
commented.  Oriental carpets are indeed met with, but they are
often used as wall draperies or couch covers rather than upon the
floors.  Greek costume (see p. 43) is so simple that there is small
need for elaborate chests of drawers, and a line of pegs upon the
wall cares for most of the family wardrobe.

All this is true; yet what furniture one finds is fashioned with
commendable grace.  There is a marked absence of heavy and unhealthful
upholstery; but the simple bed (four posts sustaining a springless
cushion stuffed with feathers or wool) has its woodwork adorned
with carving which is a true mean betwixt the too plain and the
too ornate; and the whole bed is given an elegant effect by the
magnificently embroidered scarlet tapestry which overspreads it.
The lines of the legs of the low wooden tables which are used at
the dinner parties will be a lesson (if we have time to study them)
upon just proportion and the value of subtle curves.  Moreover,
the different household vessels, the stone and bronze lamps, the
various table dishes, even the common pottery put to the humblest
uses, all have a beauty, a chaste elegance, a saving touch of deft
ornamentation, which transforms them out of "kitchen ware" into
works of art.  Those black water pots covered with red-clay figures
which the serving maids are bearing so carelessly into the scullery
at the screaming summons of the cook will be some day perchance
the pride of a museum, and teach a later age that costly material
and aristocratic uses are not needful to make an article supremely
beautiful.

Of course the well-to-do Athenian is proud to possess certain
"valuables."  He will have a few silver cups elegantly chased,
and at least one diner's couch in the andron will be made of rare
imported wood, and be inlaid with gilt or silver.  On festival
days the house will be hung with brilliant and elaborately wrought
tapestries which will suddenly emerge from the great chests.  Also,
despite frowns and criticisms, the custom is growing of decorating
one's walls with bright-lined frescoes after the manner of the Agora
colonnades.  In the course of a few generations the homes of the
wealthier Greeks will come to resemble those of the Romans, such
as a later age has resurrected at Pompeii.





Chapter V.  The Women of Athens.



27.  How Athenian Marriages are Arranged.--Over this typical Athenian
home reigns the wife of the master.  Public opinion frowns upon
celibacy, and there are relatively few unmarried men in Athens.
An Athenian girl is brought up with the distinct expectation of
matrimony.[*]  Opportunities for a romance almost never will come
her way; but it is the business of her parents to find her a suitable
husband.  If they are kindly people of good breeding, their choice
is not likely to be a very bad one.  If they have difficulties,
they can engage a professional "matchmaker," a shrewd old woman
who, for a fee, will hunt out an eligible young man.  Marriage is
contracted primarily that there may be legitimate children to keep
up the state and to perpetuate the family.  That the girl should
have any will of her own in the matter is almost never thought of.
Very probably she has never seen "Him," save when they both were
marching in a public religious procession, or at some rare family
gathering (a marriage or a funeral) when there were outside guests.
Besides she will be "given away" when only about fifteen, and
probably has formed no intelligent opinion or even prejudices on
the subject.

[*]The vile custom of exposing unwelcome female babies probably
created a certain preponderance of males in Attica, and made it
relatively easy to marry off a desirable young girl.

If a young man (who will marry at about thirty) is independent in
life, the negotiations will be with him directly.  If he is still
dependent on the paternal allowance, the two sets of parents will
usually arrange matters themselves, and demand only the formal
consent of the prospective bridegroom.  He will probably accept
promptly this bride whom his father has selected; if not, he risks
a stormy encounter with his parents, and will finally capitulate.
He has perhaps never seen "Her," and can only hope things are for
the best; and after all she is so young that his friends tell him
that he can train her to be very useful and obedient if he will only
take pains.  The parents, or, failing them, the guardians, adjust
the dowry--the lump sum which the bride will bring with her towards
the new establishment.[*]  Many maxims enjoin "marry only your equal
in fortune."  The poor man who weds an heiress will not be really
his own master; the dread of losing the big dowry will keep him in
perpetual bondage to her whims.

[*]The dowry was a great protection to the bride.  If her husband
divorced her (as by law he might), the dowry must be repaid to her
guardians with 18 per cent. interest.


28.  Lack of Sentiment in Marriages.--Sometimes marriages are
arranged in which any sentiment is obviously prohibited.  A father
can betroth his daughter by will to some kinsman, who is to take
her over as his bride when he takes over the property.  A husband
can bequeath his wife to some friend who is likely to treat her and
the orphan children with kindness.  Such affairs occur every day.
Do the Athenian women revolt at these seemingly degrading conditions,
wherein they are handed around like slaves, or even cattle?--According
to the tragic poets they do.  Sophocles (in the "Tereus") makes
them lament,


"We women are nothing;--happy indeed is our childhood, for THEN we
are thoughtless; but when we attain maidenhood, lo! we are driven
away from our homes, sold as merchandise, and compelled to marry
and say 'All's well.'"


Euripides is even more bitter in his "Medea":--


Surely of creatures that have life and wit,
We women are of all things wretchedest,
Who first must needs, as buys the highest bidder,
Thus buy a husband, and our body's master.[*/


[*]Way's translation.


29.  Athenian Marriage Rites.--However, thus runs public custom.
At about fifteen the girl must leave her mother's fostering care
and enter the house of the stranger.  The wedding is, of course,
a great ceremony; and here, if nowhere else, Athenian women can
surely prepare, flutter, and ordain to their heart's content.  After
the somewhat stiff and formal betrothal before witnesses (necessary
to give legal effect to the marriage), the actual wedding will
probably take place,--perhaps in a few days, perhaps with a longer
wait till the favorite marriage month Gamelion [January].[*]  Then
on a lucky night of the full moon the bride, having, no doubt
tearfully, dedicated to Artemis her childish toys, will be decked
in her finest and will come down, all veiled, into her father's
torchlit aula, swarming now with guests.  Here will be at last
that strange master of her fate, the bridegroom and his best man
(paranymphos).  Her father will offer sacrifice (probably a lamb),
and after the sacrifice everybody will feast on the flesh of the
victim; and also share a large flat cake of pounded sesame seeds
roasted and mixed with honey.  As the evening advances the wedding
car will be outside the door.  The mother hands the bride over to
the groom, who leads her to the chariot, and he and the groomsman
sit down, one on either side, while with torches and song the
friends to with the car in jovial procession to the house of the
young husband.

[*]This winter month was sacred to Hera, the marriage guardian.


"Ho, Hymen!  Ho, Hymen!  Hymen√¶ous!  Io!"


So rings the refrain of the marriage song; and all the doorways
and street corners are crowded with onlookers to shout fair wishes
and good-natured raillery.

At the groom's house there is a volley of confetti to greet the
happy pair.  The bride stops before the threshold to eat a quince.[*]
There is another feast,--possibly riotous fun and hard drinking.  At
last the bride is led, still veiled, to the perfumed and flower-hung
marriage chamber.  The doors close behind the married pair.  Their
friends sing a merry rollicking catch outside, the Epithalamium.
The great day has ended.  The Athenian girl has experienced the
chief transition of her life.

[*]The symbol of fertility.


30.  The Mental Horizon of Athenian Women.--Despite the suggestions
in the poets, probably the normal Athenian woman is neither degraded
nor miserable.  If she is a girl of good ancestry and the usual
bringing up, she has never expected any other conditions than
these.  She knows that her parents care for her and have tried to
secure for her a husband who will be her guardian and solace when
they are gone.  Xenophon's ideal young husband, Ischomachus, says
he married his wife at the age of fifteen.[*]  She had been "trained
to see and to hear as little as possible"; but her mother had taught
her to have a sound control of her appetite and of all kinds of
self-indulgence, to take wool and to make a dress of it, and to
manage the slave maids in their spinning tasks.  She was at first
desperately afraid of her husband, and it was some time before he
had "tamed" her sufficiently to discuss their household problems
freely.  Then Ischomachus made her join with him in a prayer to
the gods that "he might teach and she might learn all that could
conduce to their joint happiness"; after which they took admirable
counsel together, and her tactful and experienced husband (probably
more than twice her age) trained her into a model housewife.

[*]See Xenophon's "The Economist," VII ff.  The more pertinent
passages are quoted in W. S. Davis's "Readings in Ancient History,"
Vol. I, pp. 265-271.


31.  The Honor paid Womanhood in Athens.--Obviously from a young
woman with a limited intellectual horizon the Athenian gentleman
can expect no mental companionship; but it is impossible that he
can live in the world as a keenly intelligent being, and not come
to realize the enormous value of the "woman spirit" as
it affects all things good.  Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite, above
all Pallas-Athena,--city-warder of Athens,--who are they all
but idealizations of that peculiar genius which wife, mother, and
daughter show forth every day in their homes?  An Athenian never
allows his wife to visit the Agora.  She cannot indeed go outside
the house without his express permission, and only then attended by
one or two serving maids; public opinion will likewise frown upon
the man who allowed his wife to appear in public too freely[*];
nevertheless there are compensations.  Within her home the Athenian
woman is within her kingdom.  Her husband will respect her, because
he will respect himself.  Brutal and harsh he may possibly be, but
that is because he is also brutal and harsh in his outside dealings.
In extreme cases an outraged wife can sue for divorce before the
archon.  And very probably in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
the Athenian woman is contented with her lot:  partly because she
knows of nothing better; partly because she has nothing concrete
whereof to complain.

[*]Hypereides, the orator, says, "The woman who goes out of her
own home ought to be of such an age that when men meet her, the
question is not 'Who is her husband?' but 'Whose mother is she?'"
Pericles, in the great funeral oration put in his mouth by Thucydides,
says that the best women are those who are talked of for good or
ill the very least.

Doubtless it is because an Athenian house is a "little oasis
of domesticity," tenderly guarded from all insult,--a miniature
world whose joys and sorrows are not to be shared by the outer
universe,--that the Athenian treats the private affairs of his
family as something seldom to be shared, even with an intimate
friend.  Of individual women we hear and see little in Athens, but
of NOBLE WOMANHOOD a great deal.  By a hundred tokens, delightful
vase paintings, noble monuments, poetic myths, tribute is paid to
the self-mastery, the self-forgetfulness, the courage, the gentleness "of
the wives and mothers who have made Athens the beacon of Hellas";
and there is one witness better than all the rest.  Along the
"Street of Tombs," by the gate of the city, runs the long row of
stel√¶ (funeral monuments), inimitable and chaste memorials to the
beloved dead; and here we meet, many times over, the portrayal of
a sorrow too deep for common lament, the sorrow for the lovely and
gracious figures who have passed into the great Mystery.  Along
the Street of the Tombs the wives and mothers of Athens are honored
not less than the wealthy, the warriors, or the statesmen.


32.  The Sphere of Action of Athenian Women.--Assuredly the Athenian
house mother cannot match her husband in discussing philosophy or
foreign politics, but she has her own home problems and confronts
them well.  A dozen or twenty servants must be kept busy.  From
her, all the young children must get their first education, and the
girls probably everything they are taught until they are married.
Even if she does not meet many men, she will strive valiantly to
keep the good opinion of her husband.  If she has shapely feet and
hands (whereupon great stress is laid in Hellas), she will do her
utmost to display them to the greatest advantage[*]; and she has,
naturally, plenty of other vanities (see ¬ß 38).  Her husband has
turned over to her the entire management of the household.  This
means that if he is an easy-going man, she soon understands his
home business far better than he does himself, and really has him
quite at her mercy.  Between caring for her husband's wants, nursing
the sick slaves, acting as arbitress in their inevitable disputes,
keeping a constant watch upon the storeroom, and finally in attending
to the manufacture of nearly all the family clothing, she is not
likely to rust in busy idleness, or sit complaining of her lot.  At
the many great public festivals she is always at least an onlooker
and often she marches proudly in the magnificent processions.  She
is allowed to attend the tragedies in the theater.[+]  Probably,
too, the family will own a country farm, and spend a part of the
year thereon.  Here she will be allowed a delightful freedom of
movement, impossible in the closely built city.  All in all, then,
she will complain of too much enforced activity rather than of too
much idleness.

[*]The custom of wearing sandals instead of shoes of course aided
the developing of beautiful feet.

[+]Not the comedies--they were too broad for refined women.  But
the fact that Athenian ladies seem to have been allowed to attend
the tragedies is a tribute to their intellectual capacities.  Only
an acute and intelligent mind can follow √Üschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides.

Nevertheless our judgment upon the Athenian women is mainly one
of regret.  Even if not discontented with their lot, they are not
realizing the full possibilities which Providence has placed within
the reach of womanhood, much less the womanhood of the mothers of
the warriors, poets, orators, and other immortals of Athens.  One
great side of civilization which the city of Athens might develop
and realize is left unrealized.  THIS CIVILIZATION OF ATHENS IS
TOO MASCULINE; it is therefore one sided, and in so far it does not
realize that ideal "Harmony" which is the average Athenian's boast.





Chapter VI.  Athenian Costume.




33.  The General Nature of Greek Dress.--In every age the important
kingdom of dress has been reserved for the peculiar sovereignty of
woman.  This is true in Athens, though not perhaps to the extent of
later ages.  Still an Athenian lady will take an interest in "purple
and fine linen" far exceeding that of her husband, and where is there
a more fitting place than this in which to answer for an Athenian,
the ever important question "wherewithal shall I be clothed"?

Once again the Athenian climate comes in as a factor, this time
in the problem of wardrobe.  Two general styles of garment have
divided the allegiance of the world,--the clothes that are PUT ON
and the clothes that are WRAPPED AROUND.  The former style, with
its jackets, trousers, and leggings, is not absolutely unknown to
the Athenians,--their old enemies, the Persians, wear these[*];
but such clumsy, inelegant garments are despised and ridiculed as
fit only for the "Barbarians" who use them.  They are not merely
absurdly homely; they cannot even be thrown off promptly in an
emergency, leaving the glorious human form free to put forth any
noble effort.  The Athenians wear the wrapped style of garments,
which are, in final analysis, one or two large square pieces of cloth
flung skillfully around the body and secured by a few well-placed
pins.  This costume is infinitely adjustable; it can be expanded
into flowing draperies or contracted into an easy working dress
by a few artful twitches.  It can be nicely adjusted to meet the
inevitable sense of "beauty" bred in the bone of every Athenian.
True, on the cold days of midwinter the wearers will go about
shivering; but cold days are the exception, warm days the rule, in
genial Attica.[+]

[*]The Persians no doubt learned to use this style of garment during
their life on the cold, windy steppes of Upper Asia, before they
won their empire in the more genial south.

[+]The whole civilization of Athens was, of course, based on a
climate in which artificial heat would be very little needed.  A
pot of glowing charcoal might be used to remove the chill of a
room in the very coldest weather.  Probably an Athenian would have
regarded a climate in which furnace heat was demanded nearly eight
months in the year as wholly unfit for civilized man.

This simplicity of costume has produced certain important results.
There are practically no tailors in Athens, only cloth merchants,
bleachers, and dyers.  Again fashions (at least in the cut of the
garments) seldom change.  A cloak that was made in the days of
Alcibiades (say 420 B.C.) can be worn with perfect propriety to-day
(360 B.C.) if merely it has escaped without severe use or moth
holes.  It may be more usual this year to wear one's garments a
little higher or a little more trailing than formerly; but THAT is
simply a matter for a shifting of the pins or of the girdle.

As a result, the Athenian seldom troubles about his "spring" or
"winter" suit.  His simple woolen garments wear a very long time;
and they have often been slowly and laboriously spun and woven by
his wife and her slave girls.  Of course even a poor man will try
to have a few changes of raiment,--something solid and coarse for
every day, something of finer wool and gayer color for public and
private festivals.  The rich man will have a far larger wardrobe,
and will pride himself on not being frequently seen in the same
dress; yet even his outfit will seem very meager to the dandies of
a later age.


34.  the Masculine Chiton, Himation, and Chlamya.--The essential
garments of an Athenian man are only two--the CHITON and the HIMATION.
The chiton may be briefly described as an oblong of woolen cloth
large enough to wrap around the body somewhat closely, from the
neck down to just above the knees.  The side left open is fastened
by fibul√¶--elegantly wrought pins perhaps of silver or gold; in the
closed side there is a slit for the arm.  There is a girdle, and,
if one wishes, the skirt of the chiton may be pulled up through it,
and allowed to hang down in front, giving the effect of a blouse.
The man of prompt action, the soldier, traveler, worker, is "well
girded,"--his chiton is drawn high, but the deliberate old gentleman
who parades the Agora, discussing poetry or statecraft, has his
chiton falling almost to a trailing length.  Only occasionally short
sleeves were added to this very simple garment; they are considered
effeminate, and are not esteemed.  If one's arms get cold, one can
protect them by pulling up the skirt, and wrapping the arms in the
blouse thus created.

An Athenian gentleman when he is in the house wears nothing but
his chiton; it is even proper for him to be seen wearing nothing
else upon the streets, but then more usually he will add an outer
cloak,--his HIMATION.

The himation is even simpler than the chiton.  It is merely a generous
oblong woolen shawl.  There are innumerable ways of arranging it
according to the impulse of the moment; but usually it has to be
worn without pins, and that involves wrapping it rather tightly
around the body, and keeping one of the hands confined to hold the
cloak in place.  That is no drawback, however, to a genteel wearer.
It proclaims to the world that HE does not have to work, wearing
his hands for a living; therefore he can keep them politely idle.[*]
The adjustment of the himation is a work of great art.  A rich man
will often have a special slave whose business it is to arrange
the hang and the folds before his master moves forth in public;
and woe to the careless fellow if the effect fails to display due
elegance and dignity!

[*]Workingmen often wore no himation, and had a kind of chiton (an
ex√∂mis) which was especially arranged to leave them with free use
of their arms.

There is a third garment sometimes worn by Athenians.  Young men
who wish to appear very active, and genuine travelers, also wear
a CHLAMYS, a kind of circular mantle or cape which swings jauntily
over their shoulders, and will give good protection in foul weather.

There are almost no other masculine garments.  No shirts (unless
the chiton be one), no underwear.  In their costume, as in so many
things else, the Athenians exemplify their oft-praised virtue of
simplicity.


35.  The Dress of the Women.--The dress of the women is like that
of the men, but differs, of course, in complexity.  They also have
a chiton,[*] which is more elaborately made, especially in the
arrangement of the blouse; and probably there is involved a certain
amount of real SEWING[+]; not merely of PINNING.

[*]This robe was sometimes known by the Homeric name of PEPLOS.

[+]Probably with almost all Greek garments the main use of the
needle was in the embroidery merely, or in the darning of holes
and rents.  It was by no means an essential in the real manufacture.

Greater care is needed in the adjustment of the "zone" (girdle),
and half sleeves are the rule with women, while full sleeves are
not unknown.  A Greek lady again cannot imitate her husband, and
appear in public in her chiton only.  A himation, deftly adjusted,
is absolutely indispensable whenever she shows herself outside the
house.

These feminine garments are all, as a rule, more elaborately
embroidered, more adorned with fringes and tassels, than those of
the men.  In arranging her dress the Athenian lady is not bound
by the rigid precepts of fashion.  Every separate toilette is an
opportunity for a thousand little niceties and coquetries which she
understands exceedingly well.  If there is the least excuse for an
expedition outside the house, her ladyship's bevy of serving maids
will have a serious time of it.  While their mistress cools herself
with a huge peacock-feather fan, one maid is busy over her hair; a
second holds the round metallic mirror before her; a third stands
ready to extend the jewel box whence she can select finger rings,
earrings, gold armlets, chains for her neck and hair, as well as the
indispensable brooches whereon the stability of the whole costume
depends.  When she rises to have her himation draped around her,
the directions she gives reveal her whole bent and character.  A
dignified and modest matron will have it folded loosely around her
entire person, covering both arms and hands, and even drawing it
over her head, leaving eyes and nose barely visible.  Younger ladies
will draw it close around the body so as to show the fine lines of
their waists and shoulders.  And in the summer heat the himation
(for the less prudish) will become a light shawl floating loose
and free over the shoulders, or only a kind of veil drawn so as to
now conceal, now reveal, the face.

Children wear miniature imitations of the dress of their elders.
Boys are taught to toughen their bodies by refraining from thick
garments in cold weather.  In hot weather they can frequently be
seen playing about with very little clothing at all!


36.  Footwear and Head Coverings.--Upon his feet the Athenian
frequently wears nothing.  He goes about his home barefoot; and not
seldom he enjoys the delight of running across the open greensward
with his unsandaled feet pressing the springing ground; but normally
when he walks abroad, he will wear SANDALS, a simple solid pair of
open soles tied to his feet by leather thongs passing between the
toes.  For hard country walking and for hunting there is something
like a high leather boot,[*] though doubtless these are counted
uncomfortable for ordinary wear.  As for the sandals, simple as
they are, the Attic touch of elegance is often upon them.  Upon the
thongs of the sandals there is usually worked a choice pattern, in
some brilliant color or even gilt.

[*]Actors, too, wore a leather boot with high soles to give them
extra height--the COTHURNUS.

The Athenians need head coverings even less than footgear.  Most of
them have thick hair; baldness is an uncommon affliction; everybody
is trained to walk under the full glare of Helios with little
discomfort.  Of course certain trades require hats, e.g. sailors
who can be almost identified by their rimless felt caps.  Genteel
travelers will wear wide-brimmed hats; but  the ladies, as a rule,
have no headgear besides their tastefully arranged hair, although
they will partly atone for the lack, by having a maid walk just
behind them with a gorgeously variegated parasol.


37.  The Beauty of the Greek Dress.--Greek Costume, then, is
something fully sharing in the national characteristics of harmony,
simplicity, individuality.  It is easy to see how admirably this
style of dress is adapted to furnish over ready models and inspiration
for the sculptor.[*]  Unconventional in its arrangement, it is
also unconventional in its color.  A masculine crowd is not one
unmitigated swarm of black and dark grays or browns, as with the
multitude of a later age.  On the contrary, white is counted as
theoretically the most becoming color on any common occasion for
either sex;[+] and on festival days even grave and elderly men
will appear with chitons worked with brilliant embroidery along the
borders, and with splendid himatia of some single clear hue--violet,
red, purple, blue, or yellow.  As for the costume of the groom at
a wedding, it is far indeed from the "conventional black" of more
degenerate days.  He may well wear a purple-edged white chiton of
fine Milesian wool, a brilliant scarlet himation, sandals with blue
thongs and clasps of gold, and a chaplet of myrtle and violets.
His intended bride is led out to him in even more dazzling array.
Her white sandal-thongs are embroidered with emeralds, rubies, and
pearls.  Around her neck is a necklace of gold richly set,--and
she has magnificent golden armlets and pearl eardrops.  Her hair
is fragrant with Oriental nard, and is bound by a purple fillet
and a chaplet of roses.  Her ungloved fingers shine with jewels
and rings.  Her main costume is of a delicate saffron, and over it
all, like a cloud, floats the silvery tissue of the nuptial veil.

[*]"The chiton became the mirror of the body," said the late writer
Achilles Tatius.

[+]No doubt farmers and artisans either wore garments of a
non-committal brown, or, more probably, let their originally white
costume get utterly dirty.


38.  Greek Toilet Frivolities.--From the standpoint of inherent
fitness and beauty, this Athenian costume is the noblest ever seen
by the world.  Naturally there are ill-advised creatures who do
not share the good taste of their fellows, or who try to deceive
the world and themselves as to the ravages of that arch-enemy of
the Hellene,--Old Age.  Athenian women especially (though the men
are not without their follies) are sometimes fond of rouge, false
hair, and the like.  Auburn hair is especially admired, and many
fine dames bleach their tresses in a caustic wash to obtain it.
The styles of feminine hair dressing seem to change from decade to
decade much more than the arrangements of the garments.  Now it is
plaited and crimped hair that is in vogue, now the more beautiful
"Psyche-knots"; yet even in their worst moods the Athenian women
exhibit a sweet reasonableness.  They have not yet fallen into the
clutches of the Parisian hairdresser.

The poets, of course, ridicule the foibles of the fair sex.[*]
Says one:--


The golden hair Nikylla wears
   Is hers, who would have thought it?
She swears 'tis hers, and true she swears
   For I know where she bought it!


And again:--


You give your cheeks a rosy stain,
With washes dye your hair;
But paint and washes both are vain
To give a youthful air.
An art so fruitless then forsake,
Which, though you much excel in,
You never can contrive to make
Old Hecuba young Helen.


[*]Translated in Falke's "Greece and Rome" (English translation,
p. 69).  These quotations probably date from a time considerably
later than the hypothetical period of this sketch; but they are
perfectly proper to apply to conditions in 360 B.C.

But enough of such scandals!  All the best opinion--masculine and
feminine--frowns on these follies.  Let us think of the simple,
dignified, and √¶sthetically noble costume of the Athenians as not
the least of their examples to another age.





Chapter VII.  The Slaves.




39.  Slavery an Integral Part of Greek Life.--An Athenian lady cares
for everything in her house,--for the food supplies, for the clothing,
yet probably her greatest task is to manage the heterogeneous
multitude of slaves which swarm in every wealthy or even well-to-do
mansion.[*]

[*]The Athenians never had the absurd armies of house slaves which
characterized Imperial Rome; still the numbers of their domestic
servants were, from a modern standpoint, extremely large.

Slaves are everywhere:  not merely are they the domestic servants,
but they are the hands in the factories, they run innumerable little
shops, they unload the ships, they work the mines, they cultivate
the farms.  Possibly there are more able-bodied male slaves in
Attica than male free men, although this point is very uncertain.
Their number is the harder to reckon because they are not required
to wear any distinctive dress, and you cannot tell at a glance
whether a man is a mere piece of property, or a poor but very proud
and important member of the "Sovereign Demos [People] of Athens."

No prominent Greek thinker seems to contest the righteousness and
desirability of slavery.  It is one of the usual, nay, inevitable,
things pertaining to a civilized state.  Aristotle the philosopher
puts the current view of the case very clearly.  "The lower sort
of mankind are BY NATURE slaves, and it is better for all inferiors
that they should be under the rule of a master.  The use made of
slaves and of tame animals is not very different; for both by their
bodies minister to the needs of life."  The intelligent, enlightened,
progressive Athenians are naturally the "masters"; the stupid,
ignorant, sluggish minded Barbarians are the "inferiors."  Is it
not a plain decree of Heaven that the Athenians are made to rule,
the Barbarians to serve?--No one thinks the subject worth serious
argument.

Of course the slave cannot be treated quite as one would treat an
ox.  Aristotle takes pains to point out the desirability of holding
out to your "chattel" the hope of freedom, if only to make him work
better; and the great philosopher in his last testament gives freedom
to five of his thirteen slaves.  Then again it is recognized as
clearly against public sentiment to hold fellow Greeks in bondage.
It is indeed done.  Whole towns get taken in war, and those of
the inhabitants who are not slaughtered are sold into slavery.[*]
Again, exposed children, whose parents have repudiated them, get
into the hands of speculators, who raise them "for market."  There
is also a good deal of kidnapping in the less civilized parts of
Greece like √Ütolia.  Still the proportion of genuinely GREEK slaves
is small.  The great majority of them are "Barbarians," men born
beyond the pale of Hellenic civilization.

[*]For example, the survivors, after the capture of Melos, in the
Peloponesian War.


40.  The Slave Trade in Greece.--There are two great sources of
slave supply:  the Asia Minor region (Lydia and Phrygia, with Syria
in the background), and the Black Sea region, especially the northern
shores, known as Scythia.  It is known to innumerable heartless
"traders" that human flesh commands a very high price in Athens
or other Greek cities.  Every little war or raid that vexes those
barbarous countries so incessantly is followed by the sale of the
unhappy captives to speculators who ship them on, stage by stage,
to Athens.  Perhaps there is no war; the supply is kept up then
by deliberately kidnapping on a large scale, or by piracy.[*]  In
any case the arrival of a chain gang of fettered wretches at the
Peir√¶us is an everyday sight.  Some of these creatures are submissive
and tame (perhaps they understand some craft or trade); these can
be sold at once for a high price.  Others are still doltish and
stubborn.  They are good for only the rudest kind of labor, unless
they are kept and trained at heavy expense.  These brutish creatures
are frequently sold off to the mines, to be worked to death by the
contractors as promptly and brutally as one wears out a machine;
or else they become public galley slaves, when their fate is
practically the same.  But we need not follow such horrors.

[*]A small but fairly constant supply of slaves would come from
the seizure of the persons and families of bankrupt debtors, whose
creditors, especially in the Orient, might sell them into bondage.

The remainder are likely to be purchased either for use upon the
farm, the factory, or in the home.  There is a regular "circle"
at or near the Agora for traffic in them.  They are often sold at
auction.  The price of course varies with the good looks, age,[*]
or dexterity of the article, or the abundance of supply.  "Slaves
will be high" in a year when there has been little warfare and
raiding in Asia Minor.  "Some slaves," says Xenophon, "are well
worth two min√¶ [$36.00 (1914) or $640.80 (2000)] and others barely
half a mina [$9.00 (1914) or $160.20 (2000)]; some sell up to five
min√¶ [$90.00 (1914) or $1,602.00 (2000)] and even for ten [$180.00
(1914) or $3,204.00 (2000)].  Nicias, the son of Nicaretus, is
said to have given a talent [over $1,000.00 (1914) or $17,800.00
(2000)] for an overseer in the mines."[+]  The father of Demosthenes
owned a considerable factory.  He had thirty-two sword cutters
worth about five min√¶ each, and twenty couch-makers (evidently less
skilled) worth together 40 min√¶ [about $720.00 (1914) or $12,816.00
(2000)].  A girl who is handsome and a clever flute player, who will
be readily hired for supper parties, may well command a very high
price indeed, say even 30 min√¶ [about $540.00 (1914) or $9,612.00
(2000)].

[*]There was probably next to no market for old women; old men in
broken health would also be worthless.  Boys and maids that were
the right age for teaching a profitable trade would fetch the most.

[+]Xenophon, "Memorabilia," ii. 5, ¬ß 2.


41.  The Treatment of Slaves in Athens.--Once purchased, what is
the condition of the average slave?  If he is put in a factory, he
probably has to work long hours on meager rations.  He is lodged
in a kind of kennel; his only respite is on the great religious
holidays.  He cannot contract valid marriage or enjoy any of the
normal conditions of family life.  Still his evil state is partially
tempered by the fact that he has to work in constant association
with free workmen, and he seems to be treated with a moderate amount
of consideration and good camaraderie.  On the whole he will have
much less to complain of (if he is honest and industrious) than
his successors in Imperial Rome.

In the household, conditions are on the whole better.  Every Athenian
citizen tries to have at least ONE slave, who, we must grant, may
be a starving drudge of all work.  The average gentleman perhaps
counts ten to twenty as sufficient for his needs.  We know of
households of fifty.  There must usually be a steward, a butler in
charge of the storeroom or cellar, a marketing slave, a porter,
a baker, a cook,[*] a nurse, perhaps several lady's maids,
the indispensable attendant for the master's walks (a graceful,
well-favored boy, if possible), the pedagogue for the children,
and in really rich families, a groom, and a mule boy.  It is the
business of the mistress to see that all these creatures are kept
busy and reasonably contented.  If a slave is reconciled to his
lot, honest, cheerful, industrious, his condition is not miserable.
Athenian slaves are allowed a surprising amount of liberty, so
most visitors to the city complain.  A slave may be flogged most
cruelly, but he cannot be put to death at the mere whim of his
master.  He cannot enter the gymnasium, or the public assembly; but
he can visit the temples.  As a humble member of the family he has
a small part usually in the family sacrifices.  But in any case he is
subject to one grievous hardship:  when his testimony is required
in court he must be "put to the question" by torture.  On the
other hand, if his master has wronged him intolerably, he can take
sanctuary at the Temple of Theseus, and claim the privilege of being
sold to some new owner.  A slave, too, has still another grievance
which may be no less galling because it is sentimental.  His name
(given him arbitrarily perhaps by his master) is of a peculiar
category, which at once brands him as a bondsman:  Geta, Manes,
Dromon, Sosias, Xanthias, Pyrrhias,--such names would be repudiated
as an insult by a citizen.

[*]Who, however, could not be trusted to cook a formal dinner.  For
such purpose an expert must be hired.


42.  Cruel and Kind Masters.--Slavery in Athens, as everywhere
else, is largely dependent upon the character of the master; and
most Athenian masters would not regard crude brutality as consistent
with that love of elegance, harmony, and genteel deliberation
which characterizes a well-born citizen.  There do not lack masters
who have the whip continually in their hands, who add to the raw
stripes fetters and branding, and who make their slaves unceasingly
miserable; but such masters are the exception, and public opinion
does not praise them.  Between the best Athenians and their slaves
there is a genial, friendly relation, and the master will put up
with a good deal of real impertinence, knowing that behind this
forwardness there is an honest zeal for his interests.

Nevertheless the slave system of Athens is not commendable.  It
puts a stigma upon the glory of honest manual labor.  It instills
domineering, despotic habits into the owners, cringing subservience
into the owned.  Even if a slave becomes freed, he does not become
an Athenian citizen; he is only a "metic," a resident foreigner,
and his old master, or some other Athenian, must be his patron and
representative in every kind of legal business.  It is a notorious
fact that the MERE STATE of slavery robs the victim of his self-respect
and manhood.  Nevertheless nobody dreams of abolishing slavery as
an institution, and the Athenians, comparing themselves with other
communities, pride themselves on the extreme humanity of their
slave system.


43.  The "City Slaves" of Athens.--A large number of nominal "slaves"
in Athens differ from any of the creatures we have described.  The
community, no less than an individual, can own slaves just as it
can own warships and temples.  Athens owns "city slaves" (Demosioi)
of several varieties.  The clerks in the treasury office, and the
checking officers at the public assemblies are slaves; so too are
the less reputable public executioners and torturers; in the city
mint there is another corps of slave workers, busy coining "Athena's
owls"--the silver drachmas and four-drachma pieces.  But chiefest
of all, THE CITY OWNS ITS PUBLIC POLICE FORCE.  The "Scythians"
they are called from their usual land of origin, or the "bowmen,"
from their special weapon, which incidentally makes a convenient
cudgel in a street brawl.  There are 1200 of them, always at the
disposal of the city magistrates.  They patrol the town at night,
arrest evil-doers, sustain law and order in the Agora, and especially
enforce decorum, if the public assemblies or the jury courts become
tumultuous.  They have a special cantonment on the hill of Areopagus
near the Acropolis.  "Slaves" they are of course in name, and
under a kind of military discipline; but they are highly privileged
slaves.  The security of the city may depend upon their loyal zeal.
In times of war they are auxiliaries.  Life in this police force
cannot therefore be burdensome, and their position is envied by
all the factory workers and the house servants.





Chapter VIII.  The Children.




44.  The Desirability of Children in Athens.--Besides the oversight
of the slaves the Athenian matron has naturally the care of the
children.  A childless home is one of the greatest of calamities.
It means a solitary old age, and still worse, the dying out of the
family and the worship of the family gods.  There is just enough
of the old superstitious "ancestor worship" left in Athens to make
one shudder at the idea of leaving the "deified ancestor" without
any descendants to keep up the simple sacrifices to their memory.
Besides, public opinion condemns the childless home as not contributing
to the perpetuation of the city.  How Corinth, Thebes, or Sparta
will rejoice, if it is plain that Athens is destroying herself by
race suicide!  So at least ONE son will be very welcome.  His advent
is a day of happiness for the father, of still greater satisfaction
for the young mother.


45.  The Exposure of Infants.--How many more children are welcome
depends on circumstances.  Children are expensive luxuries.  They
must be properly educated and even the boys must be left a fair
fortune.[*]  The girls must always have good dowries, or they cannot
"marry according to their station."  Public opinion, as well as
the law, allows a father (at least if he has one or two children
already) to exercise a privilege, which later ages will pronounce
one of the foulest blots on Greek civilization.  After the birth
of a child there is an anxious day or two for the poor young mother
and the faithful nurses.--Will he 'nourish' it?  Are there boys
enough already?  Is the disappointment over the birth of a daughter
too keen?  Does he dread the curtailment in family luxuries necessary
to save up for an allowance or dowry for the little stranger?  Or
does the child promise to be puny, sickly, or even deformed?  If
any of these arguments carry adverse weight, there is no appeal
against the father's decision.  He has until the fifth day after
the birth to decide.  In the interval he can utter the fatal words,
"Expose it!"  The helpless creature is then put in a rude cradle,
or more often merely in a shallow pot and placed near some public
place; e.g. the corner of the Agora, or near a gymnasium, or the
entrance to a temple.  Here it will soon die of mere hunger and
neglect unless rescued.  If the reasons for exposure are evident
physical defects, no one will touch it.  Death is certain.  If,
however, it seems healthy and well formed, it is likely to be
taken up and cared for.  Not out of pure compassion, however.  The
harpies who raise slaves and especially slave girls, for no honest
purposes, are prompt to pounce upon any promising looking infant.
They will rear it as a speculation; if it is a girl, they will
teach it to sing, dance, play.  The race of light women in Athens
is thus really recruited from the very best families.  The fact
is well known, but it is constantly winked at.  Aristophanes, the
comic poet, speaks of this exposure of children as a common feature
of Athenian life.  Socrates declares his hearers are vexed when
he robs them of pet ideas, "like women who have had their children
taken from them."  There is little or nothing for men of a later
day to say of this custom save condemnation.[+]

[*]The idea of giving a lad a "schooling" and then turning him loose
to earn his own living in the world was contrary to all Athenian
theory and practice.

[+]About the only boon gained by this foul usage was the fact that,
thanks to it, the number of physically unfit persons in Athens
was probably pretty small, for no one would think of bringing up
a child which, in its first babyhood, promised to be a cripple.


46.  The Celebration of a Birth.--But assuredly in a majority
of cases, the coming of a child is more than welcome.  If a girl,
tufts of wool are hung before the door of the happy home; if a boy,
there is set out an olive branch.  Five days after the birth, the
nurse takes the baby, wrapped almost to suffocation in swaddling
bands, to the family hearth in the "andron," around which she runs
several times, followed doubtless, in merry, frolicking procession,
by most of the rest of the family.  The child is now under the care
of the family gods.  There is considerable eating and drinking.
Exposure now is no longer possible.  A great load is off the mind
of the mother.  But on the "tenth day" comes the real celebration
and the feast.  This is the "name day."  All of the kinsmen are
present.  The house is full of incense and garlands.  The cook is
in action in the kitchen.  Everybody brings simple gifts, along with
abundant wishes of good luck.  There is a sacrifice, and during
the ensuing feast comes the naming of the child.  Athenian names
are very short and simple.[*]  A boy has often his father's name,
but more usually his grandfather's, as, e.g., Themistocles, the
son of Neocles, the son of Themistocles:  the father's name being
usually added in place of a surname.  In this way certain names
will become a kind of family property, and sorrowful is the day
when there is no eligible son to bear them!

The child is now a recognized member of the community.  His father
has accepted him as a legitimate son, one of his prospective heirs,
entitled in due time to all the rights of an Athenian citizen.

[*]Owing to this simplicity and the relatively small number of
Athenian names, a directory of the city would have been a perplexing
affair.

47.  Life and Games of Young Children.--The first seven years of a
Greek boy's life are spent with his nurses and his mother.  Up to
that time his father takes only unofficial interest in his welfare.
Once past the first perilous "five days," an Athenian baby has
no grounds to complain of his treatment.  Great pains are taken
to keep him warm and well nourished.  A wealthy family will go to
some trouble to get him a skilful nurse, those from Sparta being
in special demand, as knowing the best how to rear healthy infants.
He has all manner of toys, and Aristotle the philosopher commends
their frequent donation; otherwise, he says, children will be
always "breaking things in the house."  Babies have rattles.  As
they grow older they have dolls of painted clay or wax, sometimes
with movable hands and feet, and also toy dishes, tables, wagons,
and animals.  Lively boys have whipping toys, balls, hoops, and
swings.  There is no lack of pet dogs, nor of all sorts of games on
the blind man's bluff and "tag" order.[*]  Athenian children are,
as a class, very active and noisy.  Plato speaks feelingly of their
perpetual "roaring."  As they grow larger, they begin to escape
more and more from the narrow quarters of the courts of the house,
and play in the streets.

[*]It is not always easy to get the exact details of such ancient
games, for the "rules" have seldom come down to us; but generally
speaking, the games of Greek children seem extremely like those of
the twentieth century.


48.  Playing in the Streets.--Narrow, dirty, and dusty as the
streets seem, children, even of good families, are allowed to play
in them.  After a rain one can see boys floating toy boats of
leather in every mud puddle, or industriously making mud pies.  In
warm weather the favorite if cruel sport is to catch a beetle, tie
a string to its legs, let it fly off, then twitch it back again.
Leapfrog, hide-and-seek, etc., are in violent progress down every
alley.  The streets are not all ideal playgrounds.  Despite genteel
ideas of dignity and moderation, there is a great deal of foul talk
and brawling among the passers, and Athenian children have receptive
eyes and ears.  Yet on the other hand, there is a notable regard
and reverence for childhood.  With all its frequent callousness and
inhumanity, Greek sentiment abhors any brutality to young children.
Herodotus the historian tells of the falling of a roof, whereby one
hundred and twenty school children perished, as being a frightful
calamity,[*] although recounting cold-blooded massacres of thousands
of adults with never a qualm; and Herodotus is a very good spokesman
for average Greek opinion.

[*]Herodotus, VI. 27.


49.  The First Stories and Lessons.--Athens has no kindergartens.
The first teaching which children will receive is in the form of
fables and goblin tales from their mothers and nurses,--usually
with the object of frightening them into "being good,"--tales of the
spectral Lami√¶, or of the horrid witch Mormo who will catch nasty
children; or of Empusa, a similar creature, who lurks in shadows
and dark rooms; or of the Kabaloi, wild spirits in the woods.  Then
come the immortal fables of √Üsop with their obvious application
towards right conduct.  Athenian mothers and teachers have no
two theories as to the wisdom of corporeal punishment.  The rod
is never spared to the spoiling of the child, although during the
first years the slipper is sufficient.  Greek children soon have
a healthy fear of their nurses; but they often learn to love them,
and funeral monuments will survive to perpetuate their grateful
memory.


50.  The Training of Athenian Girls.--Until about seven years old
brothers and sisters grow up in the Gyn√¶conitis together.  Then the
boys are sent to school.  The girls will continue about the house
until the time of their marriage.  It is only in the rarest of
cases that the parents feel it needful to hire any kind of tutor
for THEM.  What the average girl knows is simply what her mother
can teach her.  Perhaps a certain number of Athenian women (of good
family, too) are downright illiterate; but this is not very often
the case.  A normal girl will learn to read and write, with her
mother for school mistress.[*]  Very probably she will be taught
to dance, and sometimes to play on some instrument, although this
last is not quite a proper accomplishment for young women of good
family.  Hardly any one dreams of giving a woman any systematic
intellectual training.[+]  Much more important it is that she
should know how to weave, spin, embroider, dominate the cook, and
superintend the details of a dinner party.  She will have hardly
time to learn these matters thoroughly before she is "given a
husband," and her childhood days are forever over (see ¬ß 27).

[*]There has come down to us a charming Greek terra-cotta (it is
true, not from Athens) showing a girl seated on her mother's knee,
and learning from a roll which she holds.

[+]Plato suggested in his "Republic" (V. 451 f.) that women should
receive the same educational opportunities as the men.  This was
a proposition for Utopia and never struck any answering chord.

Meantime her brother has been started upon a course of education
which, both in what it contains and in what it omits, is one of
the most interesting and significant features of Athenian life.





Chapter IX.  The Schoolboys of Athens.




51.  Athenians Generally Literate.--Education is not compulsory by
law in Athens, but the father who fails to give his son at least a
modicum of education falls under a public contempt, which involves no
slight penalty.  Practically all Athenians are at least literate.
In Aristophanes's famous comedy, "The Knights," a boorish
"sausage-seller" is introduced, who, for the purposes of the play,
must be one of the very scum of society, and he is made to cry,
"Only consider now my education!  I can but barely read, just in
a kind of way."[*]  Evidently if illiterates are not very rare in
Athens, the fellow should have been made out utterly ignorant.  "He
can neither swim[+] nor say his letters," is a common phrase for
describing an absolute idiot.  When a boy has reached the age of
seven, the time for feminine rule is over; henceforth his floggings,
and they will be many, are to come from firm male hands.

[*]Aristophanes, "Knights", II. 188-189.

[+]Swimming was an exceedingly common accomplishment among the
Greeks, naturally enough, so much of their life being spent upon
or near the sea.


52.  Character Building the Aim of Athenian Education.--The true
education is of course begun long before the age of seven.  CHARACTER
NOT BOOK-LEARNING, IS THE MAIN OBJECT OF ATHENIAN EDUCATION, i.e.
to make the boy self-contained, modest, alert, patriotic, a true
friend, a dignified gentleman, able to appreciate and participate
in all that is true, harmonius and beautiful in life.  To that end
his body must be trained, not apart from, but along with his mind.
Plato makes his character Protagoras remark, "As soon as a child
understands what is said to him, the nurse, the mother, the pedagogue,
and the father vie in their efforts to make him good, by showing
him in all that he does that 'THIS is right,' and 'THAT is wrong';
'this is pretty,' and 'that is ugly'; so that he may learn what to
follow and what to shun.  If he obeys willingly--why, excellent.
If not, then try by threats and blows to correct him, as men
straighten a warped and crooked sapling."  Also after he is fairly
in school "the teacher is enjoined to pay more attention to his
morals and conduct than to his progress in reading and music."


53.  The Schoolboy's Pedagogue.--It is a great day for an Athenian
boy when he is given a pedagogue.  This slave (perhaps purchased
especially for the purpose) is not his teacher, but he ought to be
more than ordinarily honest, kindly, and well informed.  His prime
business is to accompany the young master everywhere out-of-doors,
especially to the school and to the gymnasium; to carry his books
and writing tablets; to give informal help upon his lessons; to
keep him out of every kind of mischief; to teach him social good
manners; to answer the thousand questions a healthy boy is sure to
ask; and finally, in emergencies, if the schoolmaster or his father
is not at hand, to administer a needful whipping.  A really capable
pedagogue can mean everything to a boy; but it is asking too much
that a purchased slave should be an ideal companion.[*]  Probably
many pedagogues are responsible for their charges' idleness or
downright depravity.  It is a dubious system at the best.

[*]No doubt frequently the pedagogue would be an old family servant
of good morals, loyalty, and zeal.  In that case the relation might
be delightful.

The assigning of the pedagogue is simultaneous with the beginning
of school days; and the Athenians are not open to the charge
of letting their children waste their time during possible study
hours.  As early as Solon's day (about 590 B.C.) a law had to be
passed forbidding schools to open BEFORE daybreak, or to be kept
open after dusk.  This was in the interest not of good eyesight,
but of good morals.  Evidently schools had been keeping even longer
than through the daylight.  In any case, at gray dawn every yawning
schoolboy is off, urged on by his pedagogue, and his tasks will
continue with very little interruption through the entire day.
It is therefore with reason that the Athenian lads rejoice in the
very numerous religious holidays.


54.  An Athenian School.--Leaving the worthy citizen's home, where
we have lingered long chatting on many of the topics the house and
its denizens suggest, we will turn again to the streets to seek
the school where one of the young sons of the family has been duly
conducted (possibly, one may say, driven) by his pedagogue.  We
have not far to go.  Athenian schools have to be numerous, because
they are small.  To teach children of the poorer classes it is
enough to have a modest room and a few stools; an unrented shop
will answer.  But we will go to a more pretentious establishment.
There is an anteroom by the entrance way where the pedagogues can
sit and doze or exchange gossip while their respective charges are
kept busy in the larger room within.  The latter place, however,
is not particularly commodious.  On the bare wall hang book-rolls,
lyres, drinking vessels, baskets for books, and perhaps some simple
geometric instruments.  The pupils sit on rude, low benches, each
lad with his boxwood tablet covered with wax[*] upon his lap, and
presumably busy, scratching letters with his stylus.  The master
sits on a high chair, surveying the scene.  He cultivates a grim
and awful aspect, for he is under no delusion that "his pupils
love him."  "He sits aloft," we are told, "like a juryman, with an
expression of implacable wrath, before which the pupil must tremble
and cringe."[+]

[*]This wax tablet was practically a slate.  The letters written
could be erased with the blunt upper end of the metallic stylus,
and the whole surface of the tablet could be made smooth again by
a judicious heating.

[+]The quotation is from the late writer Libanius, but it is
perfectly true for classic Athens.

Athenian schoolboys have at least their full share of idleness, as
well as of animal spirits.  There is soon a loud whisper from one
corner.  Instantly the ruling tyrant rises.  "Antiphon!  I have
heard you.  Come forward!"  If Antiphon is wise, he will advance
promptly and submit as cheerfully as possible to a sound caning;
if folly possesses him, he will hesitate.  At a nod from the master
two older boys, who serve as monitors, will seize him with grim
chuckles.  He will then be fortunate if he escapes being tied to a
post and flogged until his back is one mass of welts, and his very
life seems in danger.  It will be useless for him to complain to
his parents.  A good schoolmaster is supposed to flog frequently to
earn his pay; if he is sparing with the rod or lash, he is probably
lacking in energy.  Boys will be boys, and there is only one remedy
for juvenile shortcomings.

This diversion, of course, with its attendant howling, interrupts
the course of the school, but presently matters again become normal.
The scholars are so few that probably there is only one teacher,
and instruction is decidedly "individual," although poetry and
singing are very likely taught "in concert."


55.  The School Curriculum.--As to the subjects studied, the
Athenian curriculum is well fixed and limited:  letters, music, and
gymnastics.  Every lad must have a certain amount of all of these.
They gymnastics will be taught later in the day by a special
teacher at a "wrestling school."  The "music" may also be taught
separately.  The main effort with a young boy is surely to teach
him to read and write.  And here must be recalled the relative
infrequency of complete books in classic Athens.[*]  To read public
placards, inscriptions of laws, occasional epistles, commercial
documents, etc., is probably, for many Athenians, reading enough.
The great poets he will learn by ear rather than by eye; and he
may go through a long and respected life and never be compelled to
read a really sizable volume from end to end.  So the teaching of
reading is along very simple lines.  It is perhaps simultaneous
with the learning of writing.  The twenty-four letters are learned
by sheer power of memory; then the master sets lines upon the
tablets to be copied.  As soon as possible the boy is put to learning
and writing down passages from the great poets.  Progress in mere
literacy is very rapid.  There is no waste of time on history,
geography, or physical science; and between the concentration on a
singly main subject and the impetus given by the master's rod the
Athenian schoolboy soon becomes adept with his letters.  Possibly
a little arithmetic is taught him, but only a little.  In later life,
if he does not become a trader or banker, he will not be ashamed
to reckon simple sums upon his fingers or by means of pebbles;
although if his father is ambitious to have him become a philosopher,
he may have him taught something of geometry.

Once more we see the total absence of "vocational studies" in this
Athenian education.  The whole effort is to develop a fair, noble,
free, and lofty character, not to earn a living.  To set a boy
to study with an eye to learning some profitable trade is counted
illiberal to the last degree.  It is for this reason that practical
arithmetic is discouraged, yet a little knowledge of the art
of outline drawing is allowed; for though no gentleman intends to
train his son to be a great artist, the study will enable him to
appreciate good sculpture and painting.  Above all the schoolmaster,
who, despite his brutal austerity, ought to be a clear-sighted
and inspiring teacher, must lose no opportunity to instill moral
lessons, and develop the best powers of his charges.  Theoginis,
the old poet of Megara, states the case well:--


To rear a child is easy; but to teach
Morals and manners is beyond our reach.
To make the foolish wise, the wicked good,
That science never yet understood.


56.  The Study of the Poets.--It is for the developing of the best
moral and mental qualities in the lads that they are compelled to
memorize long passages of the great poets of Hellas.  Theoginis,
with his pithy admonitions cast in semi-proverb form, the worldly
wisdom of Hesiod, and of Phocylides are therefore duly flogged
into every Attic schoolboy.[*]  But the great text-book dwarfing
all others, is Homer,--"the Bible of the Greeks," as later ages
will call it.  Even in the small school we visit, several of the
pupils can repeat five or six long episodes from both the "Iliad"
and the "Odyssey," and there is one older boy present (an extraordinary,
but by no means an unprecedented case) who can repeat BOTH of the
long epics word for word.[+]  Clearly the absence of many books has
then its compensations.  The average Athenian lad has what seems
to be a simply marvelous memory.

[*]Phocylides, whose gnomic poetry is now preserved to us only in
scant fragments, was an Ionian, born about 560 B.C.  His verses
were in great acceptance in the schools.

[+]For such an attainment see Xenophon's "Symposium," 3:5.

And what an admirable text-book and "second reader" the Homeric poems
are!  What characters to imitate:  the high-minded, passionate, yet
withal loyal and lovable Achilles who would rather fight gloriously
before Troy (though death in the campaign is certain) than live a
long life in ignoble ease at home at Phthia; or Oysseus, the "hero
of many devices," who endures a thousand ills and surmounts them
all; who lets not even the goddess Calypso seduce him from his
love to his "sage Penelope"; who is ever ready with a clever tale,
a plausible lie, and, when the need comes, a mighty deed of manly
valor.  The boys will all go home to-night with firm resolves to
suffer all things rather than leave a comrade unavenged, as Achilles
was tempted to do and nobly refused, and to fight bravely, four
against forty, as Odysseus and his comrades did, when at the call
of duty and honor they cleared the house of the dastard suitors.
True, philosophers like Plato complain:  "Homer gives to lads very
undignified and unworthy ideas of the gods"; and men of a later
age will assert:  "Homer has altogether too little to say about
the cardinal virtues of truthfulness and honesty."[*]  But making
all allowances the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" are still the two grandest
secular text-books the world will ever know.  The lads are definitely
the better for them.

[*]The virtue of unflinching HONESTY was undoubtedly the thing least
cultivated by the Greek education.  Successful prevarication, e.g.
in the case of Odysseus, was put at altogether too high a premium.
It is to be feared that the average Athenian schoolboy was only
partially truthful.  The tale of "George Washington and the cherry
tree" would never have found favor in Athens.  The great Virginian
would have been blamed for failing to concoct a clever lie.

Three years, according to Plato, are needed to learn the rudiments
of reading and writing before the boys are fairly launched upon
this study of the poets.  For several years more they will spend
most of their mornings standing respectfully before their master,
while he from his chair reads to them from the roll of one author
or another,--the pupils repeating the lines, time and again, until
they have learned them, while the master interrupts to explain
every nice point in mythology, in real or alleged history, or a
moot question in ethics.


57.  The Greeks do not study Foreign Languages.--As the boys
grow older the scope of their study naturally increases; but in
one particular their curriculum will seem strangely limited.  THE
STUDY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES HAS NO PLACE IN A GREEK COURSE OF STUDY.
That any gentleman should learn say Persian, or Egyptian (unless
he intended to devote himself to distant travel), seems far more
unprofitable than, in a later age, the study of say Patagonian
or Papuan will appear.[*]  Down at the Peir√¶us there are a few
shipmasters, perhaps, who can talk Egyptian, Ph≈ìnecian, or Babylonish.
They need the knowledge for their trade, but even they will disclaim
any cultural value for their accomplishment.  The euphonious,
expressive, marvelously delicate tongue of Hellas sums up for the
Athenian almost all that is valuable in the world's intellectual
and literary life.  What has the outer, the "Barbarian," world
to give him?--Nothing, many will say, but some gold darics which
will corrupt his statesmen, and some spices, carpets, and similar
luxuries which good Hellenes can well do without.  The Athenian
lad will never need to crucify the flesh upon Latin, French, and
German, or an equivalent for his own Greek.  Therein perhaps he
may be heavily the loser, save that his own mother tongue is so
intricate and full of subtle possibilities that to learn to make
the full use thereof is truly a matter for lifelong education.

[*]This fact did not prevent the Greeks from having a considerable
respect for the traditions and lore of, e.g., the Egyptians, and
from borrowing a good many non-Greek usages and inventions; but
all this could take place without feeling the least necessity for
studying foreign languages.


58.  The Study of "Music."--But the Athenian has a substitute for
this omission of foreign language study:  MUSIC.  This is something
more comprehensive than "the art of combining tones in a manner to
please the ear" [Webster].  It is practically the study of whatever
will develop the noble powers of the emotions, as contrasted to
the mere intellect.[*]  Indeed everything which comes within the
ample provinces of the nine Muses, even sober history, might be
included in the term.  However, for special purposes, the study of
"Music" may be considered as centering around playing instruments
and singing.  The teacher very likely resides in a house apart
from the master of the school of letters.  Aristophanes gives this
picture of the good old customs for the teaching of music.  "The
boys from the same section of the town have to march thinly clad
and draw up in good order--though the snow be thick as meal--to the
house of the harp master.  There he will teach them [some famous
tune] raising a mighty melody.  If any one acts silly or turns any
quavers, he gets a good hard thrashing for 'banishing the Muses!'"[+]

[*]Aristotle ["Politics," V. (or VIII.) 1] says that the literary
education is to train the mind; while music, though of no practical
use, "provides a noble and liberal employment of leisure."

[+]Aristophanes's "The Clouds".  The whole passage is cited in
Davis's "Readings in Ancient History," vol. I, pp. 252-255.

Learning to sing is probably the most important item, for every
boy and man ought to be able to bear his part in the great chorals
which are a notable element in most religious festivals; besides,
a knowledge of singing is a great aid to appreciating lyric poetry,
or the choruses in tragedy, and in learning to declaim.  To learn
to sing elaborate solo pieces is seldom necessary,--it is not quite
genteel in grown-up persons, for it savors a little too much of the
professional.  So it is also with instrumental music.  The Greeks
lack the piano, the organ, the elaborate brass instruments of a
later day.  Their flutes and harps, although very sweet, might seem
thin to a twentieth-century critic.  But one can gain considerable
volume by the great NUMBER of instruments, and nearly everybody
in Athens can pick at the lyre after a fashion.  The common type of
harp is the lyre, and it has enough possibilities for the average boy.
The more elaborate CITHERA is usually reserved for professionals.[*]
An Athenian lad is expected to be able to accompany his song upon
his own lyre and to play in concert with his fellows.

[*]For the details of these harp types of instruments see Dictionary
of Antiquities.

The other instrument in common use is the FLUTE.  At its simplest,
this is a mere shepherd's pipe.  Anybody can make one with a knife
and some rushes.  Then come elaborations; two pipes are fitted
together into one wooden mouthpiece.  Now, we really have an
instrument with possibilities.  But it is not in such favor in the
schools as the lyre.  You cannot blow day after day upon the flute
and not distort your cheeks permanently.  Again the gentleman's
son will avoid "professionalism."  There are amateur flute players
moving in the best society, but the more fastidious frown upon the
instrument, save for hired performers.


59.  The Moral Character of Greek Music.--Whether it is singing,
harp playing, or flute playing, a most careful watch is kept upon
the CHARACTER of the music taught the lads.  The master who lets
his pupils learn many soft, dulcet, languishing airs will find his
charges' parents extremely angry, even to depriving him of their
patronage.  Very soft music, in "Lydian modes," is counted effeminate,
fit only for the women's quarters and likely to do boys no good.
The riotous type also, of the "Ionic mode," is fit only for drinking
songs and is even more under the ban.[*]  What is especially in
favor is the stern, strenuous Dorian mode.  This will make boys
hardy, manly, and brave.  Very elaborate music with trills and
quavers is in any case frowned upon.  It simply delights the trained
ear, and has no reaction upon the character; and of what value is
a musical presentation unless it leaves the hearers and performer
better, worthier men?  Let the average Athenian possess the
opportunity, and he will infallibly stamp with disapproval a great
part of both the popular and the classical music of the later
ages.[+]

[*]The "Phrygian mode" from which the "Ionic" was derived was still
more demoralizing; it was counted "orgiastic," and proper only in
certain excited religious rhapsodies.

[+]We have extremely few Greek melodies preserved to us and these
few are not attractive to the modern ear.  All that can fairly be
said is that the Hellenes were obvious such √¶sthetic, harmoniously
minded people that it is impossible their music should have failed
in nobility, beauty, and true melody.


60.  The Teaching of Gymnastics.--The visits to the reading school
and to the harp master have consumed a large part of the day; but
towards afternoon the pedagogues will conduct their charges to the
third of the schoolboys' tyrants:  the gymnastic teacher.  Nor do
his parents count this the least important of the three.  Must not
their sons be as physically "beautiful" (to use the common phrase
in Athens) as possible, and must they not some day, as good citizens,
play their brave part in war?  The pal√¶stras (literally "wrestling
grounds") are near the outskirts of the city, where land is cheap
and a good-sized open space can be secured.  Here the lads are
given careful instruction under the constant eye of an expert in
running, wrestling, boxing, jumping, discus hurling, and javelin
casting.  They are not expected to become professional athletes,
but their parents will be vexed if they do not develop a healthy
tan all over their naked bodies,[*] and if they do not learn at
least moderate proficiency in the sports and a certain amount of
familiarity with elementary military maneuvers.  Of course boys
of marked physical ability will be encouraged to think of training
for the various great "games" which culminate at Olympia, although
enlightened opinion is against the promoting of professional
athletics; and certain extreme philosophers question the wisdom of
any extensive physical culture at all, "for (say they) is not the
human mind the real thing worth developing?"[+]

[*]To have a pale, untanned skin was "womanish" and unworthy of a
free Athenian citizen.

[+]The details of the boys' athletic games, being much of a kind
with those followed by adults at the regular public gymnasia, are
here omitted.  See Chap. XVII.

Weary at length and ready for a hearty meal and sleep, the boys
are conducted homeward by their pedagogues.

As they grow older the lads with ambitious parents will be given
a more varied education.  Some will be put under such teachers of
the new rhetoric and oratory, now in vogue, as the famous socrates,
and be taught to play the orator as an aid to inducing their fellow
citizens to bestow political advancement.  Certain will be allowed
to become pupils of Plato, who has been teaching his philosophy
out at the groves of the Academy, or to join some of his rivals in
theoretical wisdom.  Into these fields, however, we cannot follow
them.


61.  The Habits and Ambitions of Schoolboys.--It is a clear fact,
that by the age say of thirteen, the Athenian education has had a
marked effect upon the average schoolboy.  Instead of being "the
most ferocious of animals," as Plato, speaking of his untutored
state describes him, he is now "the most amiable and divine of
living beings."  The well-trained lad goes now to school with his
eyes cast upon the ground, his hands and arms wrapped in his chiton,
making way dutifully for all his elders.  If he is addressed by an
older man, he stands modestly, looking downward and blushing in a
manner worthy of a girl.  He has been taught to avoid the Agora,
and if he must pass it, never to linger.  The world is full of
evil and ugly things, but he is taught to hear and see as little of
them as possible.  When men talk of his healthy color, increasing
beauty, and admire the graceful curves of his form at the wrestling
school, he must not grow proud.  He is being taught to learn relatively
little from books, but a great deal from hearing the conversation
of grave and well-informed men.  As he grows older his father will
take him to all kinds of public gatherings and teach him the working
details of the "Democratic Government" of Athens.  He becomes
intensely proud of his city.  It is at length his chief thought,
almost his entire life.  A very large part of the loyalty which
an educated man of a later age will divide between his home, his
church, his college, his town, and his nation, the Athenian lad
will sum up in two words,--"my polis"; i.e. the city of Athens.
His home is largely a place for eating and sleeping; his school
is not a great institution, it is simply a kind of disagreeable
though necessary learning shop; his church is the religion of his
ancestors, and this religion is warp and woof of the government,
as much a part thereof as the law courts or the fighting fleet;
his town and his nation are alike the sovran city-state of Athens.
Whether he feels keenly a wider loyalty to Hellas at large, as
against the Great King of Persia, for instance, will depend upon
circumstances.  In a real crisis, as at Salamis,--yes.  In ordinary
circumstances when there is a hot feud with Sparta,--no.


62.  The "Ephebi."--The Athenian education then is admirably adapted
to make the average lad a useful and worthy citizen, and to make
him modest, alert, robust, manly, and a just lover of the beautiful,
both in conduct and in art.  It does not, however, develop his
individual bent very strongly; and it certainly gives him a mean
view of the dignity of labor.  He will either become a leisurely
gentleman, whose only proper self-expression will come in warfare,
politics, or philosophy; or--if he be poor--he will at least envy
and try to imitate the leisure class.

By eighteen the young Athenian's days of study will usually come
to a close.  At that age he will be given a simple festival by
his father and be formally enrolled in his paternal deme.[*]  His
hair, which has hitherto grown down toward his shoulders, will be
clipped short.  He will allow his beard to grow.  At the temple
of Aglaurus he will (with the other youths of his age) take solemn
oath of loyalty to Athens and her laws.  For the next year he will
serve as a military guard at the Peir√¶us, and receive a certain
training in soldiering.  The next year the state will present
him with a new shield and spear, and he will have a taste of the
rougher garrison duty at one of the frontier forts towards B≈ìtia or
Megara.[+]  Then he is mustered out.  He is an ephebus no longer,
but a full-fledged citizen, and all the vicissitudes of Athenian
life are before him.

[*]One of the hundred or more petty townships or precincts into
which Attica was divided.

[+]These two years which the ephebi of Athens had to serve under
arms have been aptly likened to the military service now required
of young men in European countries.





Chapter X.  The Physicians of Athens.




63.  The Beginnings of Greek Medical Science.--As we move about
the city we cannot but be impressed by the high average of fine
physiques and handsome faces.  Your typical Greek is fair in color
and has very regular features.  The youths do not mature rapidly,
but thanks to the gymnasia and the regular lives, they develop not
merely admirable, but healthy, bodies.  The proportion of hale and
hearty OLD men is great; and probably the number of invalids is
considerably smaller than in later times and in more artificially
reared communities.[*]  Nevertheless, the Athenians are certainly
mortal, and subject to bodily ills, and the physician is no unimportant
member of society, although his exact status is much less clearly
determined than it will be in subsequent ages.

[*]A slight but significant witness to the general healthiness of
the Greeks is found in the very rare mention in their literature
of such a common ill as TOOTHACHE.

Greek medicine and surgery, as it appears in Homer, is simply a
certain amount of practical knowledge gained by rough experience,
largely supplemented by primitive superstition.  It was quite as
important to know the proper prayers and charms wherewith to approach
"Apollo the Healer," as to understand the kind of herb poultice
which would keep wounds from festering.  Homer speaks of Asclepius;
however, in early days he was not a god, but simply a skilful leach.
Then as we approach historic times the physician's art becomes
more regular.  Asclepius is elevated into a separate and important
deity, although it is not till 420 B.C. that his worship is formally
introduced into Athens.  Long ere that time, however, medicine and
surgery had won a real place among the practical sciences.  The
sick man stands at least a tolerable chance of rational treatment,
and of not being murdered by wizards and fanatical exorcists.


64.  Healing Shrines and their Methods.--There exist in Athens and
in other Greek cities real sanataria[*]; these are temples devoted
to the healing gods (usually Asclepius, but sometimes Apollo,
Aphrodite, and Hera).  Here the patient is expected to sleep over
night in the temple, and the god visits him in a dream, and reveals
a course of treatment which will lead to recovery.  Probably there
is a good deal of sham and imposture about the process.  The canny
priests know more than they care to tell about how the patient is
worked into an excitable, imaginative state; and of the very human
means employed to produce a satisfactory and informing dream.[+]
Nevertheless it is a great deal to convince the patient that he
is sure of recovery, and that nobody less than a god has dictated
the remedies.  The value of mental therapeutics is keenly appreciated.
Attached to the temple are skilled physicians to "interpret" the
dream, and opportunities for prolonged residence with treatment by
baths, purgation, dieting, mineral waters, sea baths, all kinds of
mild gymnastics, etc.  Entering upon one of these temple treatments
is, in short anything but surrendering oneself to unmitigated quackery.
Probably a large proportion of the former patients have recovered;
and they have testified their gratitude by hanging around the
shrine little votive tablets,[$] usually pictures of the diseased
parts now happily healed, or, for internal maladies, a written
statement of the nature of the disease.  This is naturally very
encouraging to later patients:  they gain confidence knowing that
many cases similar to their own have been thus cured.

[*]The most famous was at Epidaurus, where the Asclepius cult seems
to have been especially localized.

[+]The "healing sleep" employed at these temples is described, in
a kind of blasphemous parody, in Aristophanes's "Plutus."  (Significant
passages are quoted in Davis's "Readings in Ancient History," vol.
I, pp. 258-261.)

[$]Somewhat as in the various Catholic pilgrimage shrines (e.g.
Lourdes) to-day.

These visits to the healing temples are, however, expensive:  not
everybody has entire faith in them; for many lesser ills also they
are wholly unnecessary.  Let us look, then, at the regular physicians.


65.  An Athenian Physician's Office.--There are salaried public
medical officers in Athens, and something like a public dispensary
where free treatment is given citizens in simple cases; but the
average man seems to prefer his own doctor.[*]  We may enter the
office of Menon, a "regular private practitioner," and look about
us.  The office itself is a mere open shop in the front of a house
near the Agora; and, like a barber's shop is something of a general
lounging place.  In the rear one or two young disciples (doctors
in embryo) and a couple of slaves are pounding up drugs in mortars.
There are numbers of bags of dried herbs and little glass flasks
hanging on the walls.  Near the entrance is a statue of Asclepius
the Healer, and also of the great human founder of the real medical
science among the Greeks--Hippocrates.

[*]We know comparatively little of these public physicians; probably
they were mainly concerned with the health of the army and naval
force, the prevention of epidemics, etc.

Menon himself is just preparing to go out on his professional
calls.  He is a handsome man in the prime of his life, and takes
great pains with his personal appearance.  His himation is carefully
draped.  His finger rings have excellent cameos.  His beard has
been neatly trimmed, and he has just bathed and scented himself
with delicate Assyrian nard.  He will gladly tell you that he is
in no wise a fop, but that it is absolutely necessary to produce
a pleasant personal impression upon his fastidious, irritable
patients.  Menon himself claims to have been a personal pupil of
the great Hippocrates,[*] and about every other reputable Greek
physician will make the same claim.  He has studied more or less
in a temple of Asclepius, and perhaps has been a member of the
medical staff thereto attached.  He has also become a member of
the Hippocratic brotherhood, a semi-secret organization, associated
with the Asclepius cult, and cheerfully cherishing the dignity of
the profession and the secret arts of the guild.

[*]Who was still alive, an extremely old man.  He died in Thessaly
in 357 B.C., at an alleged age of 104 years.

66.  The Physician's Oath.--The oath which all this brotherhood has
sworn is noble and notable.  Here are some of the main provisions:--


"I swear by Apollo the Physician, and Asclepius and Hygeia; a
[Lady Health] and Panaceia [Lady All-Cure] to honor as my parents
the master who taught me this art, and to admit to my own instruction
only his sons, my own sons, and those who have been duly inscribed
as pupils, and who have taken the medical oath, and no others.  I
will prescribe such treatment as may be for the benefit of my
patients, according to my best power and judgment, and preserve
them from anything hurtful or mischievous.  I will never, even if
asked, administer poison, nor advise its use.  I will never give
a criminal draught to a woman.  I will maintain the purity and
integrity of my art.  Wherever I go, I will abstain from all mischief
or corruption, or any immodest action.  If ever I hear any secret
I will not divulge it.  If I keep this oath, may the gods give me
success in life and in my art.  If I break this oath, may all the
reverse fall upon me."[*]


[*]For the unabridged translation of this oath, see Smith's
"Dictionary of Antiquities" (revised edition), vol. II, p. 154.


67.  The Skill of Greek Physicians.--Menon's skill as a physician
and surgeon is considerable.  True, he has only a very insufficient
conception of anatomy.  His THEORETICAL knowledge is warped, but
he is a shrewd judge of human nature and his PRACTICAL knowledge
is not contemptible.  In his private pharmacy his assistants have
compounded a great quantity of drugs which he knows how to administer
with much discernment.  He has had considerable experience in dealing
with wounds and sprains, such as are common in the wars or in the
athletic games.  He understands that Dame Nature is a great healer,
who is to be assisted rather than coerced; and he dislikes resorting
to violent remedies, such as bleedings and strong emetics.  Ordinary
fevers and the like he can attack with success.  He has no modern
an√¶sthetics or opium, but has a very insufficient substitute in
mandragora.  He can treat simple diseases of the eye; and he knows
how to put gold filling into teeth.  His surgical instruments,
however, are altogether too primitive.  He is personally cleanly;
but he has not the least idea of antiseptics; the result is that
obscure internal diseases, calling for grave operations, are likely
to baffle him.  He will refuse to operate, or if he does operate
the chances are against the patient.[*]  In other words, his medical
skill is far in advance of his surgery.

[*]Seemingly a really serious operation was usually turned over
by the local physician to a traveling surgeon, who could promptly
disappear from the neighborhood if things went badly.

Menon naturally busies himself among the best families of Athens,
and commands a very good income.  He counts it part of his equipment
to be able to persuade his patients, by all the rules of logic and
rhetoric, to submit to disagreeable treatment; and for that end
has taken lessons in informal oratory from Isocrates or one of his
associates.  Some of Menon's competitors (feeling themselves less
eloquent) have actually a paid rhetorician whom they can take to
the bedside of a stubborn invalid, to induce him by irrefutable
arguments to endure an amputation.[*]

[*]Plato tells how Gorgias, the famous rhetorician, was sometimes
thus hired.  A truly Greek artifice--this substitution of oratory
for chloroform!

No such honor of course is paid to the intellects of the poorer fry,
who swarm in at Menon's surgery.  Those who cannot pay to have him
bandage them himself, perforce put up with the secondary skill and
wisdom of the "disciples."  The drug-mixing slaves are expected to
salve and physic the patients of their own class; but there seems
to be a law against allowing them to attempt the treatment of
free-born men.


68.  Quacks and Charlatans.--Unluckily not everybody is wise enough
to put up with the presumably honest efforts of Menon's underlings.
There appears to be no law against anybody who wishes to pose as
a physician, and to sell his inexperience and his quack nostrums.
Vendors of every sort of cure-all abound, as well as creatures who
work on the superstitions and pretend to cure by charms and hocus-pocus.
In the market there is such a swarm of these charlatans of healing
that they bring the whole medical profession into contempt.  Certain
people go so far as to distrust the efficacy of any part of the
lore of Asclepius.  Says one poet tartly:--


The surgeon Menedemos, as men say,
  Touched as he passed a Zeus of marble white;
  Neither the marble nor his Zeus-ship might
Avail the god--they buried him to-day.


And again even to dream of the quacks is dangerous:--


Diophantes, sleeping, saw
  Hermas the physician:
Diophantes never woke
  From that fatal vision.[*]


[*]Both of these quotations probably date from later than 360 B.C.,
but they are perfectly in keeping with the general opinion of Greek
quackery.

All in all, despite Menon's good intentions and not despicable
skill, it is fortunate the gods have made "Good Health" one of
their commonest gifts to the Athenians.  Constant exercise in the
gymnasia, occasional service in the army, the absence of cramping
and unhealthful office work, and a climate which puts out-of-door
existence at a premium, secure for them a general good health that
compensates for most of the lack of a scientific medicine.





Chapter XI.  The Funerals.




69.  An Athenian's Will.--All Menon's patient's are to-day set
out upon the road to recovery.  Hipponax, his rival, has been less
fortunate.  A wealthy and elderly patient, Lycophron, died the
day before yesterday.  As the latter felt his end approaching, he
did what most Athenians may put off until close to the inevitable
hour--he made his will, and called in his friends to witness it;
and one must hope there can be no doubt about the validity, the
signets attached, etc., for otherwise the heirs may find themselves
in a pretty lawsuit.

The will begins in this fashion:  "The Testament of Lyophron the
Marathonian.[*]  May all be well:--but if I do not recover from
this sickness, thus do I bestow my estate."  Then in perfectly
cold-blooded fashion he proceeds to give his young wife and the
guardianship of his infant daughter to Stobiades, a bachelor friend
who will probably marry the widow within two months or less of the
funeral.  Lycophron gives also specific directions about his tomb;
he gives legacies of money or jewelry to various old associates;
he mentions certain favorite slaves to receive freedom, and as
specifically orders certain others (victims of his displeasure)
to be kept in bondage.  Lastly three reliable friends are names as
executors.

[*]In all Athenian legal documents, it was necessary to give the
deme of the interested party or parties.


70.  The Preliminaries of a Funeral.--An elaborate funeral is the
last perquisite of every Athenian.  Even if Lycophron had been a poor
man he would now receive obsequies seemingly far out of proportion
to his estate and income.  It is even usual in Greek states to have
laws restraining the amount which may be spent upon funerals,--otherwise
great sums may be literally "burned up" upon the funeral pyres.
When now the tidings go out that Lycophron's nearest relative has
"closed his mouth," after he has breathed his last, all his male
kinsfolk and all other persons who HOPE to be remembered in the
will promptly appear in the Agora in black himatia[*] and hasten
to the barber shops to have their heads shaved.  The widow might
shave her hair likewise, with all her slave maids, did not her
husband, just ere his death, positively forbid such disfigurements.
The women of the family take the body in charge the minute the
physician has declared that all is over.  The customary obol is put
in the mouth of the corpse,[+] and the body is carefully washed in
perfumed water, clothed in festal white; then woolen fillets are
wound around the head, and over these a crown of vine leaves.  So
arrayed, the body is ready to be laid out on a couch in the front
courtyard of the house, with the face turned toward the door so
as to seem to greet everybody who enters.  In front of the house
there stands a tall earthen vase of water, wherewith the visitors
may give themselves a purifying sprinkling, after quitting the
polluting presence of a dead body.

[*]In the important city of Argos, however, WHITE was the proper
funeral color.

[+]This was not originally (as later asserted) a fee to Charon the
ferryman to Hades, but simply a "minimum precautionary sum, for the
dead man's use" (Dr. Jane Harrison), placed in the mouth, where a
Greek usually kept his small change.


71.  Lamenting of the Dead.--Around this funeral bed the relatives
and friends keep a gloomy vigil.  The Athenians after all are
southern born, and when excited seem highly emotional people.  There
are stern laws dating from Solon's day against the worst excesses,
but what now occurs seems violent enough.  The widow is beating
her breast, tearing her hair, gashing her cheeks with her finger
nails.  Lycophron's elderly sister has ashes sprinkled upon her gray
head and ever and anon utters piteous wails.  The slave women in
the background keep up a hideous moaning.  The men present do not
think it undignified to utter loud lamentation and to shed frequent
tears.  Least commendable of all (from a modern standpoint) are the
hired dirge singers, who maintain a most melancholy chant, all the
time beating their breasts, and giving a perfect imitation of frantic
grief.  This has probably continued day and night, the mourners
perhaps taking turns by relays.

All in all it is well that Greek custom enjoins the actual funeral,
at least, on the second day following the death.[*]  The "shade"
of the deceased is not supposed to find rest in the nether world
until after the proper obsequies.[+]  To let a corpse lie several
days without final disposition will bring down on any family severe
reproach.  In fact, on few points are the Greeks more sensitive
than on this subject of prompt burial or cremation.  After a land
battle the victors are bound never to push their vengeance so far
as to refuse a "burial truce" to the vanquished; and it is a doubly
unlucky admiral who lets his crews get drowned in a sea fight,
without due effort to recover the corpses afterward and to give
them proper disposition on land.

[*]It must be remembered that the Greeks had no skilled embalmers
at their service, and that they lived in a decidedly warm climate.

[+]See the well-known case of the wandering shade of Patrocius
demanding the proper obsequies from Achilles (Iliad, XXIII. 71).


72.  The Funeral Procession.--The day after the "laying-out" comes
the actual funeral.  Normally it is held as early as possible in
the morning, before the rising of the sun.  Perhaps while on the
way to the Agora we have passed, well outside the city, such a
mournful procession.  The youngest and stoutest of the male relatives
carry the litter:  although if Lycophron's relatives had desired
a really extravagant display they might have employed a mule car.
Ahead of the bier march the screaming flute players, earning their
fees by no melodious din.  Then comes the litter itself with the
corpse arrayed magnificently for the finalities, a honey cake set
in the hands,[*] a flask of oil placed under the head.  After this
come streaming the relatives in irregular procession:  the widow and
the chief heir (her prospective second husband!) walking closest,
and trying to appear as demonstrative as possible:  nor (merely
because the company is noisy and not stoical in its manner) need
we deny that there is abundant genuine grief.  All sorts of male
acquaintances of the deceased bring up the rear, since it is good
form to proclaim to wide Athens that Lycophon had hosts of friends.[+]

[*]The original idea of the honey cake was simply that it was a
friendly present to the infernal gods; later came the conceit that
it was a sop to fling to the dog Cerberus, who guarded the entrance
to Hades.

[+]Women, unless they were over sixty years of age, were not allowed
to join in funeral processions unless they were first cousins, or
closer kin, of the deceased.


73.  The Funeral Pyre.--So the procession moves through the still
gloomy streets of the city,--doubtless needing torch bearers as
well as flute players,--and out through some gate, until the line
halts in an open field, or better, in a quiet and convenient garden.
Here the great funeral pyre of choice dry fagots, intermixed with
aromatic cedar, has been heaped.  The bier is laid thereon.  There
are no strictly religious ceremonies.  The company stands in
a respectful circle, while the nearest male kinsman tosses a pine
link upon the oil-soaked wood.  A mighty blaze leaps up to heaven,
sending its ruddy brightness against the sky now palely flushed
with the bursting dawn.  The flutists play in softer measures.  As
the fire rages a few of the relatives toss upon it pots of rare
unguents; and while the flames die down, thrice the company shout
their farewells, calling their departed friend by name--"Lycophron!
Lycophron!  Lycophron!"

So fierce is the flame it soon sinks into ashes.  As soon as these
are cool enough for safety (a process hastened by pouring on water
or wine) the charred bones of the deceased are tenderly gathered
up to be placed in a stately urn.  The company, less formally now,
returns to Athens, and that night there will probably be a great
funeral feast at the house of the nearest relative, everybody
eating and drinking to capacity "to do Lycophron full honor"; for
it is he who is imagined as being now for the last time the host.


74.  Honors to the memory of the Dead.--Religion seems to have
very little place in the Athenian funeral:  there are no priests
present, no prayers, no religious hymns.  But the dead man is now
conceived as being, in a very humble and intangible way, a deity
himself:  his good will is worth propitiating; his memory is not
to be forgotten.  On the third, ninth, and thirtieth days after
the funeral there are simple religious ceremonies with offerings
of garlands, fruits, libations and the like, at the new tomb; and
later at certain times in the year these will be repeated.  The
more enlightened will of course consider these merely graceful
remembrances of a former friend; but there is a good deal of
primitive ancestor worship even in civilized Athens.

BURNING is the usual method for the Greeks to dispose of their
dead, but the burial of unburned bodies is not unknown to them.
Probably, however, the rocky soil and the limited land space around
Athens make regular cemeteries less convenient than elsewhere:  still
it would have been nothing exceptional if Lycophron had ordered in
his will that he be put in a handsome pottery coffin to be placed
in a burial ground pertaining to his family.


75.  The Beautiful Funeral Monuments.--If the noisy funeral customs
permitted to the Athenians may repel a later day observer, there
can be only praise for the Athenian tombs, or rather the funeral
monuments (st√´l√¶) which might be set over the urns or ashes or the
actual coffins.  Nearly every Athenian family has a private field
which it uses for sepulchral purposes:  but running outside of
the city, near the Itonian Gate along the road to the Peir√¶us, the
space to either side of the highway has been especially appropriated
for this purpose.  Waling hither along this "Street of the Tombs"
we can make a careful survey of some of the most touching memorials
of Athenian life.

The period of hot, violent grief seems now over; the mourners have
settled down in their dumb sense of loss.  This spirit of calm,
noble resignation is what is expressed upon these monuments.  All
is chaste, dignified, simple.  There are no labored eulogies of
the deceased; no frantic expressions of sorrow; no hint (let it
be also said) of any hope of reunions in the Hereafter.  Sometimes
there is simply a plain marble slab or pillar marked with the name
of the deceased; and with even the more elaborate monuments the
effort often is to concentrate, into one simple scene, the best and
worthiest that was connected with the dear departed.  Here is the
noble mother seated in quiet dignity extending her hand in farewell
to her sad but steadfast husband, while her children linger wonderingly
by; here is the athlete, the young man in his pride, depicted not
in the moment of weakness and death, but scraping his glorious form
with his strigil, after some victorious contest in the games; here
is the mounted warrior, slain before Corinth whilst battling for
his country, represented in the moment of overthrowing beneath
his flying charger some despairing foe.  We are made to feel that
these Athenians were fair and beautiful in their lives, and that
in their deaths they were not unworthy.  And we marvel, and admire
these monuments the more when we realize that they are not the work
of master sculptors but of ordinary paid craftsmen.  We turn away
praising the city that could produce such noble sculpture and
call it mere handicraft, and praising also the calm poise of soul,
uncomforted by revealed religion, which could make these monuments
common expressions of the bitterest, deepest, most vital emotions
which can ever come to men.[*]

[*]As Von Falke (Greece and Rome, p. 141) well says of these
monuments, "No skeleton, no scythe, no hour-glass is in them to
bring a shudder to the beholder.  As they [the departed] were in
life, mother and daughter, husband and wife, parents and children,
here they are represented together, sitting or standing, clasping
each other's hands and looking at one another with love and sympathy
as if it were their customary affectionate intercourse.  What the
stone perpetuates is the love and happiness they enjoyed together,
while yet they rejoiced in life and the light of day."





Chapter XII.  Trade, Manufactures, and Banking.




76.  The Commercial Importance of Athens.--While the funeral mourners
are wending their slow way homeward we have time to examine certain
phases of Athenian life at which we have previously glanced, then
ignored.  Certain it is, most "noble and good" gentlemen delight
to be considered persons of polite uncommercial leisure; equally
certain it is that a good income is about as desirable in Athens
as anywhere else, and many a stately "Eupatrid," who seems to
spend his whole time in dignified walks, discoursing on politics
or philosophy, is really keenly interested in trades, factories,
or farms, of which his less nobly born stewards have the active
management.  Indeed one of the prime reasons for Athenian greatness
is the fact that Athens is the richest and greatest commercial city
of Continental Hellas, with only Corinth as a formidable rival.[*]

[*]Syracuse in distant Sicily was possibly superior to Athens in
commerce and economic prosperity, although incomparably behind her
in the empire of the arts and literature.

To understand the full extent of Athenian commercial prosperity we
must visit the Peir√¶us, yet in the main city itself will be found
almost enough examples of the chief kinds of economic activity.


77.  The Manufacturing Activities of Athens.--Attica is the seat
of much manufacturing.  Go to the suburbs:  everywhere is the rank
odor of the tanneries; down at the harbors are innumerable ship
carpenters and sail and tackle makers, busy in the shipyards; from
almost every part of the city comes the clang of hammer and anvil
where hardware of all kinds is being wrought in the smithies; and
finally the potter makers are so numerous as to require special
mention hereafter.  But no list of all the manufacturing activities
is here possible; enough that practically every known industry is
represented in Athens, and the "industrial" class is large.[*]  A
very large proportion of the industrial laborers are slaves, but
by no means all.  A good many are real Athenian citizens; a still
larger proportion are "metics" (resident foreigners without political
rights).  The competition of slave labor, however, tends to keep
wages very low.  An unskilled laborer will have to be content with
his 3 obols (9 cents [1914] or $1.51 [2000]) per day; but a trained
workman will demand a drachma (18 cents [1914] or $3.02 [2000])
or even more.  There are no labor unions or trade guilds.  A son
usually, though not invariably, follows his father's profession.
Each industry and line of work tends to have its own little street
or alley, preferably leading off the Agora.  "The Street of the Marble
Workers," the "Street of the Box Makers," and notably the "Street
of the Potters" contain nearly all the workshops of a given kind.
Probably you can find no others in the city.  Prices are regulated
by custom and competition; in case any master artisan is suspected
of "enhancing" the price of a needful commodity, or his shady business
methods seem dangerous to the public, there is no hesitation in
invoking an old law or passing a new one in the Assembly to bring
him to account.

[*]For a very suggestive list of the numerous kinds of Greek industries
(practically all of which would be represented in Athens) see H.
J. Edwards, in Whibley's "Companion to Greek Studies," p. 431.

Manufacturers are theoretically under a social ban, and indeed
yonder petty shoemaker, who, with his two apprentices, first makes
up his cheap sandals, then sells them over the low counter before
his own ship, is very far from being a "leisurely" member of the
"noble and the good."  But he who, like the late Lycophron, owns
a furniture factory employing night threescore slaves, can be sure
of lying down on his couch at a dinner party among the very best;
for, as in twentieth century England, even manufacture and "trade," if
on a sufficiently large scale, cover a multitude of social sins.[*]

[*]Plato, probably echoing thoughtful Greek opinion, considered it
bad for manufacturers to be either too wealthy or too poor; thus
a potter getting too rich will neglect his art, and grow idle;
if, however, he cannot afford proper tools, he will manufacture
inferior wares, and his sons will be even worse workmen then he.
Such comment obviously comes from a society where most industrial
life is on a small scale.


78.  The Commerce of Athens.--Part of Athenian wealth comes from
the busy factories, great and small, which seem everywhere; still
more riches come in by the great commerce which will be found
centered at the Peir√¶us.  Here is the spacious Deigma, a kind
of exchange-house where ship masters can lay out samples of their
wares on display, and sell to the important wholesalers, who will
transmit to the petty shopkeepers and the "ultimate consumer."[*]

[*]Of course a very large proportion of Greek manufactures wares
were never exported, but were sold direct by the manufacturer to
the consumer himself.  This had various disadvantages; but there
was this large gain:  ONLY ONE PROFIT was necessary to be added
to the mere cost of production.  This aided to make Greece (from
a modern standpoint) a paradise of low prices.

There are certain articles of which various districts make a
specialty, and which Athens is constantly importing:  B≈ìtia sends
chariots; Thessaly, easy chairs; Chios and Miletos, bedding; and
Miletos, especially, very fine woolens.  Greece in general looks
to Syria and Arabia for the much-esteemed spices and perfumes; to
Egypt for papyri for the book rolls; to Babylonia for carpets.  To
discuss the whole problem of Athenian commerce would require a book
in itself; but certain main facts stand out clearly.  One is that
Attica herself has extremely few natural products to export--only her
olive oil, her Hymettus honey, and her magnificent marbles--dazzling
white from Pentelicos, gray from Hymettus, blue or black from
Eleusis.  Again we soon notice the great part which GRAIN plays in
Athenian commerce.  Attica raises such a small proportion of the
necessary breadstuffs, and so serious is the crisis created by any
shortage, that all kinds of measures are employed to compel a steady
flow of grain from the Black Sea ports into the Peir√¶us.  Here is
a law which Domsthenes quotes to us:--

"It shall not be lawful for any Athenian or any metic in Attica,
or any person under their control [i.e. slave or freedman] to lend
out money on a ship which is not commissioned to bring grain to
Athens."

A second law, even more drastic, forbids any such person to
transport grain to any harbor but the Peir√¶us.  The penalties for
evading these laws are terrific.  At set intervals also the Public
Assembly (Ecclesia) is in duty bound to consider the whole state
of the grain trade:  while the dealers in grain who seem to be
cornering the market, and forcing up the price of bread, are liable
to prompt and disastrous prosecution.


79.  The Adventurous Merchant Skippers.--Foreign trade at Athens
is fairly well systematized, but it still partakes of the nature
of an adventure.  The name for "skipper" (naukl√´ros) is often used
interchangeably for "merchant."  Nearly all commerce is by sea,
for land routes are usually slow, unsafe, and inconvenient[*]; the
average foreign trader is also a shipowner, probably too the actual
working captain.  He has no special commodity, but will handle
everything which promises a profit.  A war is breaking out in
Paphlagonia.  Away he sails thither with a cargo of good Athenian
shields, swords, and lances.  He loads up in that barbarous but
fertile country with grain; but leaves enough room in his hold for
some hundred skins of choice wine which he takes aboard at Chios.
The grain and wine are disembarked at the Pir√¶us.  Hardly are they
ashore ere rumor tells him that salt herring[+] are abundant and
especially cheap at Corcyra; and off he goes for a return cargo
thereof, just lingering long enough to get on a lading of Athenian
olive oil.

[*]Naturally there was a safe land route from Athens across the
Isthmus to Corinth and thence to Sparta or towards Ellis; again,
there would be fair roads into B≈ìtia.

[+]Salt fish were a very usual and important article of Greek
commerce.


80.  Athenian Money-changers and Bankers.--An important factor in the
commerce of Athens is the "Money-changer."  There is no one fixed
standard of coinage for Greece, let alone the Barbarian world.  Athens
strikes its money on a standard which has very wide acceptance,
but Corinth has another standard, and a great deal of business is
also transacted in Persian gold darics.  The result is that at the
Peir√¶us and near the Agora are a number of little "tables" where
alert individuals, with strong boxes beside them, are ready to sell
foreign coins to would-be travelers, or exchange darics for Attic
drachm√¶, against a pretty favorable commission.

This was the beginning of the Athenian banker; but from being a mere
exchanger he has often passed far beyond, to become a real master
of credit and capital.  There are several of these highly important
gentlemen who now have a business and fortune equal to that of the
famous Pasion, who died in 370 B.C.  While the firm of Pasion and
Company was at its height, the proprietor derived  a net income of
at least 100 min√¶ (over $1,800 [1914] or $30,248.07 [2000]) per year
from his banking; and more than half as much extra from a shield
factory.[*]

[*]These sums seem absurdly small for a great money magnate, but
the very high purchasing power of money in Athens must be borne in
mind.  We know a good deal about Pasion and his business from the
speeches which Deosthenes composed in the litigation which arose
over his estate.


81.  A Large Banking Establishment.--Enter now the "tables"
of Nicanor.  The owner is a metic; perhaps he claims to come from
Rhodes, but the shrewd cast of his eyes and the dark hue of his skin
gives a suggestion of the Syrian about him.  In his open office a
dozen young half-naked clerks are seated on low chairs--each with
his tablet spread out upon his knees laboriously computing long
sums.[*]  The proprietor himself acts as the cashier.  He has
not neglected the exchange of foreign moneys; but that is a mere
incidental.  His first visitor this morning presents a kind of letter
of credit from a correspondent in Syracuse calling for one hundred
drachm√¶.  "Your voucher?" asks Nicanor.  The stranger produces the
half of a coin broken in two across the middle.  The proprietor
draws a similar half coin from a chest.  The parts match exactly,
and the money is paid on the spot.  the next comer is an old
acquaintance, a man of wealth and reputation; he is followed by
two slaves bearing a heavy talent of coined silver which he wishes
the banker to place for him on an advantageous loan, against a due
commission.  The third visitor is a well-born but fast and idle
young man who is squandering his patrimony on flute girls and
chariot horses.  He wishes an advance of ten min√¶, and it is given
him--against the mortgage of a house, at the ruinous interest of
36 per cent, for such prodigals are perfectly fair play.  Another
visitor is a careful and competent ship merchant who is fitting
for a voyage to Crete, and who requires a loan to buy his return
cargo.  Ordinary interest, well secured, is 18 per cent, but a sea
voyage, even at the calmest season, is counted extra hazardous.
The skipper must pay 24 per cent at least.  A poor tradesman also
appears to raise a trifle by pawning two silver cups; and an unlucky
farmer, who cannot meet his loan, persuades the banker to extend
the time "just until the next moon"[+]--of course at an unmerciful
compounding of interest.

[*]Without the Arabic system of numerals, elaborate bookkeeping surely
presented a sober face to the Greeks.  Their method of numeration
was very much like that with the so-called Roman numerals.

[+]"Watching the moon," i.e. the end of the month when the debts
became due, appears to have been the melancholy recreation of many
Athenian debtors.  See Aristophanes's "Clouds," I. 18.


82.  Drawbacks to the Banking Business.--Nicanor has no paper money
to handle, no stocks, no bonds,--and the line between legitimate
interest and scandalous usury is by no means clearly drawn.  There
is at least one good excuse for demanding high interest.  It
is notoriously hard to collect bad debts.  Many and many a clever
debtor has persuaded an Athenian jury that ALL taking of interest
is somewhat immoral, and the banker has lost at least his interest,
sometimes too his principal.  So long as this is the case, a banker's
career has its drawbacks; and Demosthenes in a recent speech has
commended the choice by Pasion's son of a factory worth 60 min√¶
per year, instead of his father's banking business worth nominally
100.  The former was so much more secure than an income depending
on "other people's money!"

Finally it must be said that while Nicanor and Pasion have been
honorable and justly esteemed men, many of their colleagues have
been rogues.  Many a "table" has been closed very suddenly, when
its owner absconded, or collapsed in bankruptcy, and the unlucky
depositors and creditors have been left penniless, during the
"rearrangement of the tables," as the euphemism goes.


83.  The Potter of Athens.--There is one other form of economic
activity in Athens which deserves our especial notice, different as
it is from the bankers' tables,--the manufacture of earthen vases.
A long time might be spent investigating the subject; here there
is room only for a hasty glance.  For more than two hundred years
Attica has been supplying the world with a pottery which is in
some respects superior to any that has gone before, and also (all
things considered) to any that will follow, through night two and
a half millenniums.  The articles are primarily tall vases and
urns, some for mere ornament or for religious purposes,--some for
very humble household utility; however, besides the regular vases
there is a great variety of dishes, plates, pitchers, bowls, and
cups all of the same general pattern,--a smooth, black glaze[*]
covered with figures in the delicate red of the unglazed clay.  At
first the figures had been in black and the background in red, but
by about 500 B.C. the superiority of the black backgrounds had been
fully realized and the process perfected.  For a long time Athens
had a monopoly of this beautiful earthenware, but now in 360 B.C.
there are creditable manufactories in other cities, and especially
in the Greek towns of Southern Italy.  The Athenian industry is,
however, still considerable; in fifty places up and down the city,
but particularly in the busy quarter of the Ceramicus, the potters'
wheels are whirling, and the glazers are adding the elegant patterns.

[*]Sometimes this glaze tended to a rich olive green or deep brown.


84.  Athenian Pottery an Expression of the Greek Sense of
Beauty.--Athens is proud of her traditions of naval and military
glory; of the commerce of the Peir√¶us; of her free laws and
constitution; of her sculptured temples, her poets, her rhetoricians
and philosophers.  Almost equally well might she be proud of her
vases.  They are not made--let us bear clearly in mind--by avowed
artists, servants of the Muses and of the Beautiful; they are the
regular commercial products of work-a-day craftsmen.  But what
craftsmen!  In the first place, they have given to every vase
and dish a marvelous individuality.  There seems to be absolutely
no duplication of patterns.[*]  Again, since these vases are made
for Greeks, they must--no matter how humble and commonplace their
use--be made beautiful--elegantly shaped, well glazed, and well
painted:  otherwise, no matter how cheap, they will never find a
market.

[*]It is asserted that of the many thousands of extant Greek vases
that crowd the shelves of modern museums, there are nowhere two
patterns exactly alike.

The process of manufacture is simple, yet it needs a masterly touch.
After the potter has finished his work at the wheel and while the
clay is still soft, the decorator makes his rough design with a
blunt-pointed stylus.  A line of black glaze is painted around each
figure.  Then the black background is freely filled in, and the
details within the figure are added.  A surprisingly small number
of deft lines are needed to bring out the whole picture.[*]  Sometimes
the glaze is thinned out to a pale brown, to help in the drawing
of the interior contours.  When the design is completed, we have an
amount of life and expression which with the best potters is little
short of startling.  The subjects treated are infinite, as many as
are the possible phases of Greek life.  Scenes in the home and on
the farm; the boys and their masters at school; the warriors, the
merchants, the priests sacrificing, the young gallants serenading
a sweet-heart; all the tales, in short of poet-lore and mythology,--time
would fail to list one tenth of them.  Fairly we can assert that
were all the books and formal inscriptions about the Athenians to
be blotted out, these vase paintings almost photographs one might
say, of Athenian daily life, would give us back a very wide knowledge
of the habits of the men in the city of Athena.

[*]In this respect the Greek vase paintings can compete with the
best work in the Japanese prints.

The potters are justly proud of their work; often they do not
hesitate to add their signatures, and in this way later ages can
name the "craftsmen" who have transmitted to them these objects
of abiding beauty.  The designers also are accommodating enough to
add descriptive legends of the scenes which they depict,--Achilles,
Hercules, Theseus, and all the other heroes are carefully named,
usually with the words written above or beside them.

The pottery of Athens, then, is truly Athenian; that is to say,
it is genuinely elegant, ornamental, simple, and distinctive.  The
best of these great vases and mixing bowls are works of art no less
than the sculptures of Phidias upon the Parthenon.





Chapter XIII.  The Armed Forces of Athens.




85.  Military Life at Athens.--Hitherto we have seen almost nothing
save the peaceful civic side of Athenian life, but it is a cardinal
error to suppose that art, philosophy, farming, manufacturing, commerce,
and bloodless home politics sum up the whole of the activities of
Attica.  Athens is no longer the great imperial state she was in
the days of Pericles, but she is still one of the greatest military
powers in Greece,[*] and on her present armed strength rests a
large share of her prestige and prosperity.  Her fleet, which is
still her particular boast, must of course be seen at the Peir√¶us;
but as we go about the streets of the main city we notice many men,
who apparently had recently entered their house doors as plain,
harmless citizens, now emerging, clad in all the warrior's bravery,
and hastening towards one of the gates.  Evidently a review is to
be held of part of the citizen army of Athens.  If we wish, we can
follow and learn much of the Greek system of warfare in general
and of the Athenian army in particular.

[*]Of course the greatest military power of Greece had been Sparta
until 371 B.C., when the battle of Leuctra made Thebes temporarily
"the first land power."

Even at the present day, when there is plenty of complaint that
Athenians are not willing to imitate the sturdy campaigning of their
fathers, the citizens seem always at war, or getting ready for it.
Every citizen, physically fit, is liable to military service from
his eighteenth to his sixtieth year.  To make efficient soldiers
is really the main end of the constant physical exercise.  If a
young man takes pride in his hard and fit body, if he flings spears
at the stadium, and learns to race in full armor, if he goes on
long marches in the hot sun, if he sleeps on the open hillside, or
lies on a bed of rushes watching the moon rise over the sea,--it
is all to prepare himself for a worthy part in the "big day" when
Athens will confront some old or new enemy on the battlefield.  A
great deal of the conversation among the younger men is surely not
about Platonic ideals, Demosthenes's last political speech, nor
the best fighting cocks; it is about spears, shield-straps, camping
ground, rations, ambuscades, or the problems of naval warfare.

It is alleged with some show of justice that by this time Athenians
are so enamored with the pleasures of peaceful life that they prefer
to pay money for mercenary troops rather than serve themselves on
distant expeditions; and certain it is that there are plenty of
Arcadians, Thracians, and others, from the nations which supply
the bulk of the mercenaries, always in Athenian pay in the outlying
garrisons.  Still the old military tradition and organization for
the citizens is kept up, and half a generation later, when the freedom
of Athens is blasted before Philip the Macedonian at Ch√¶roneia, it
will be shown that if the Athenian militia does not know how to
conquer, it at least knows how to die.  So we gladly follow to the
review, and gather our information.


86.  The Organization of the Athenian Army.--After a young "ephebus"
has finished his two years of service in the garrisons he returns
home subject to call at the hour of need.  When there is necessity
to make up an army, enough men are summoned to meet the required
number and no more.  Thus for a small force only the eligibles
between say twenty and twenty-four years of age would be summoned;
but in a crisis all the citizens are levied up to the very graybeards.
The levy is conducted by the ten "Strategi" (at once 'generals,'
'admirals,' and 'war ministers') who control the whole armed power
of Athens.  The recruits summoned have to come with three days'
rations to the rendezvous, usually to the Lyceum wrestling ground
just outside the city.  In case of a general levy the old men are
expected to form merely a home guard for the walls; the young men
must be ready for hard service over seas.

The organization of the Athenian army is very simple; each of the
ten Attic tribes sends its own special battalion or "taxis," which
is large or small according to the total size of the levy.[*]  These
"taxeis" are subdivided into companies or "lochoi," of about an
average of 100 men each.  The "taxeis" are each under a tribal-colonel
("taxiarch"), and each company under its captain ("locharch").  The
ten strategi theoretically command the whole army together, but
since bitter experience teaches that ten generals are usually nine
too many, a special decree of the people often entrusts the supreme
command of a force to one commander, or at most to not over three.
The other strategi must conduct other expeditions, or busy themselves
with their multifarious home duties.

[*]Thus if 3000 men were called out, the average "taxis" would be
300 strong, but if 6000, then 600.


87.  The Hoplites and the Light Troops.--The unit of the Athenian
citizen army, like practically all Greek armies, is the heavy armed
infantry soldier, the HOPLITE.  An army of "three thousand men"
is often an army of so many hoplites, unless there is specific
statement to the contrary.  But really it is of six thousand men,
to be entirely accurate:  for along with every hoplite goes an
attendant, a "light-armed man," either a poor citizen who cannot
afford a regular suit of armor,[*] or possibly a trusted slave.
These "light-armed men" carry the hoplites' shields until the battle,
and most of the baggage.  They have javelins, and sometimes slings
and bows.  They act as skirmishers before the actual battle:  and
while the hoplites are in the real death-grip they harass the foe
as they can, and guard the camp.  When the fight is done they do
their best to cover the retreat, or slaughter the flying foe if
their own hoplites are victorious.

[*]The hoplite's panoply (see description later) was sufficiently
expensive to imply that its owner was at least a man in tolerable
circumstances.


88.  The Cavalry and the Peltasts.--There are certain divisions of
the army besides the hoplites and this somewhat ineffective light
infantry.  There is a cavalry corps of 1000.  Wealthy young Athenians
are proud to volunteer therein; it is a sign of wealth to be able
to provide your war horse.  The cavalry too is given the place of
honor in the great religious processions; and there is plenty of
chance for exciting scouting service on the campaign.  Again, the
cavalry service has something to commend it in that it is accounted
MUCH SAFER than the infantry![*]  The cavalry is, however, a rather
feeble fighting instrument.  Greek riders have no saddles and no
stirrups.  They are merely mounted on thin horse pads, and it is
very hard to grip the horse with the knees tightly enough to keep
from being upset ignominiously while wielding the spear.  The best
use for the cavalry perhaps is for the riders to take a sheaf of
javelins, ride up and discharge them at the foe as skirmishers,
then fall back behind the hoplites; though after the battle the
horsemen will have plenty to do in the retreat or the pursuit.

[*]Greeks could seldom have been brought to imitate the reckless
medieval cavaliers.  The example of Leonidas at Thermopyl√¶ was more
commended than imitated.  Outside of Sparta at least, few Greeks
would have hesitated to flee from a battlefield, when the day
(despite their proper exertions) had been wholly lost.

The Athenians have of course the Scythian police archers to send
into any battle near Athens; they can also hire mercenary archers
from Crete, but the Greek bows are relatively feeble, only three
or four feet long--by no means equal to the terrible yew bows which
will win glory for England in the Middle Ages.  There has also come
into vogue, especially since the Peloponnesian war, an improved
kind of light-javelin-men,--the "Peltasts,"--with small shields,
and light armor, but with extra long lances.  In recent warfare
this type of soldier, carefully trained and agile, has been known
to defeat bodies of the old-style over-encumbered hoplites.[*]
Nevertheless, most veteran soldiers still believe that the heavy
infantryman is everything, and the backbone of nearly every Greek
army is still surely the hoplite.  He will continue to be the regular
fighting unit until the improved "phalanx," and the "Companion
Cavalry" of Philip and Alexander of Macedon teach the captains of
the world new lessons.

[*]Especially the Athenian general Iphicrates was able to cut
to pieces a "mora" (brigade) of Spartan hoplites, in 392 B.C., by
skillful use of a force of peltasts.

89.  The Panoply of the Hoplite.--We have passed out one of the
gates and are very likely in a convenient open space south and east
of the city stretching away toward the ever visible slopes of gray
Hymettus.  Here is a suitable parade ground.  The citizen soldiers
are slipping on their helmets and tightening up their cuirasses.
Trumpets blow from time to time to give orders to "fall in" among
the respective "lochoi" and "taxeis."  There is plenty of time to
study the arms and armor of the hoplites during these preliminaries.

A very brief glance at the average infantryman's defensive weapons
tells us that to be able to march, maneuver, and fight efficiently
in this armor implies that the Athenian soldier is a well-trained
athlete.  The whole panoply weighs many pounds.[*]  The prime
parts in the armor are the helmet, the cuirass, the greaves, and
the shield.  Every able-bodied citizen of moderate means has this
outfit hanging in his andronitis, and can don it at brief notice.
The HELMET is normally of bronze; it is cut away enough in front
to leave the face visible, but sometimes a cautious individual will
insist on having movable plates (which can be turned up and down)
to protect the cheeks.[+]  Across the top there runs a firm metal
ridge to catch any hard down-right blow, and set into the ridge is
a tall nodding crest either of horsehair or of bright feathers--in
either case the joy and glory of the wearer.

[*]Possibly fifty or more--we have no correct means for an
exact estimate. [A note from Brett:  Looking at web sites where
reconstruction of the armor has been done and estimates made (ca.
1999) there seems to be a consistent top end of 70 pounds.  Scholarly
circles (e.g. Rudolph Storch of the University of Maryland) seem
to lock the estimate more tightly, with the consensus saying that
a fully armored Hoplite carried between 60 and 70 pounds.  Most
of this weight seems to be in the cuirass, which in some cases
was linen and weighed only 10-15 pounds (the actual thickness is
unknown, so the broad range of weight estimate covers the minimum
to maximum reasonable thickness).  For reference, a modern (2000)
soldier is generally limited to 50 pounds of gear when fighting
and 70 pounds when marching.]

[+]The "Corinthian" type of helmets came more closely over the face,
and the cheek protectors were not movable; these helmets were much
like the closed helms of the medieval knights.  The Spartans, in
their contempt for danger, wore plain pointed steel caps which gave
relatively little protection.

Buckled around the soldier's body is the CUIRASS.  It comprises
a breastplate and a back piece of bronze, joined by thongs, or by
straps with a buckle.  The metal comes down to the hips.  Below it
hangs a thick fringe of stout strips of leather strengthened with
bright metallic studs, and reaching halfway to the knees.  From this
point to the knees the legs are bare, but next come the GREAVES,
thin pliable plates of bronze fitted to the shape of the leg, and
opening at the back.  They have to be slipped on, and then are
fastened at the knees and ankle with leathern straps.

But the warrior's main protection is his SHIELD.  With a strong,
large shield you can fight passing well without any regular body
armor; while with the best outfit of the latter you are highly
vulnerable without your shield.  To know how to swing your shield
so as to catch every possible blow, to know how to push and lunge
with it against an enemy, to know how to knock a man down with it,
if needs be, THAT is a good part of the soldier's education.  The
shield is sometimes round, but more often oval.  It is about four
feet by the longest diameter.  It is made of several layers of heavy
bull's hide, firmly corded and riveted together, and has a good
metal rim and metal boss in the center.  On the inside are two
handles so that it can be conveniently wielded on the left arm.[*]
These shields are brilliantly painted, and although the Greeks have
no heraldic devices, there are all manner of badges and distinguishing
marks in vogue.  Thus all Theban shields are blazoned with a club;
Sicyonian shields are marked with the initial "Sigma" (S), and we
note that the Athenian shields are all marked Alpha (A).[+]

[*]Earlier Greek shields seem to have been very large and
correspondingly heavy.  These had only a single handle; and to aid
in shifting them they were swung on straps passed over the left
shoulder.

[+]This last is a matter of safe inference rather than of positive
information.


90.  The Weapons of a Hoplite.--The hoplites have donned their
armor.  Now they assume their offensive weapons.  Every man has a
lance and a sword.  The LANCE is a stout weapon with a solid wooden
butt, about six feet long in all.  It is really too heavy to use
as a javelin.  It is most effective as a pike thrust fairly into a
foeman's face, or past his shield into a weak spot in his cuirass.
The sword is usually kept as a reserve weapon in case the lance
gets broken.  It is not over 25 inches in length, making rather a
huge double-edged vicious knife than a saber; but it is terrible
for cut and thrust work at very close quarters.  Simple as these
weapons are, they are fearful instruments of slaughter in well-trained
hands, and the average Greek has spent a considerable part of his
life in being taught how to use them.


91.  Infantry Maneuvers.--The final trumpets have blown, and the
troops fall into their places.  Each tribal "taxis" lines up its
"lochoi."  The Greeks have no flags nor standards.  There is a
great deal of shouting by the subaltern officers, and running up
and down the ranks.  Presently everything is in formal array.  The
hoplites stand in close order, each man about two feet from the
next,[*] leaving no gaps between each division from end to end of
the lines.  The men are set in eight long ranks.  This is the normal
"phalanx"[+] order.  Only those in front can actually lunge and
strike at the enemy.  The men in the rear will add to the battering
force of the charge, and crowding in closely, wedge themselves
promptly to the front, when any of the first rank goes down.

[*]The object would be to give each man just enough distance to
let him make fair use of his lance, and yet have his shield overlap
that of his neighbor.

[+]The "phalanx" is sometimes spoken of as a Macedonian invention,
but Philip and Alexander simply improved upon an old Greek military
formation.

It is an imposing sight when the strategos in charge of the maneuvers,
a stately man in a red chlamys, gives the final word "March!"

Loud pipes begin screaming.  The long lines of red, blue, and orange
plumes nod fiercely together.  The sun strikes fire out of thousands
of brandished lance tips.  The phalanx goes swinging away over the
dusty parade ground, the subalterns up and down the files muttering
angrily to each inapt recruit to "Keep your distance:" or "Don't
advance your shield."  The commandant duly orders the "Half turn:"
"Left" or "Right turn:" "Formation by squares," and finally the
critical "Change front to rear."  If this last maneuver is successfully
accomplished, the strategos will compliment the drill sergeants;
for it is notoriously difficult to turn a ponderous phalanx around
and yet make it keep good order.  The drilling goes on until the
welcome order comes, "Ground arms!" and every perspiring soldier
lets his heavy shield slip from his arm upon the ground.


92.  The Preliminaries of a Greek Battle.--Later in the day, if
these are happy times of peace, the whole phalanx, so bristling
and formidable, will have resolved itself into its harmless units
of honest citizens all streaming home for dinner.

Our curiosity of course asks how does this army act upon the
campaign; what, in other words, is a typical Greek battle?  This
is not hard to describe.  Greek battles, until lately, have been
fought according to set formul√¶ in which there is little room for
original generalship, though much for ordinary circumspection and
personal valor.  A battle consists in the charging together of two
phalanxes of hoplites of about equal numbers.  If one army greatly
overmatches the other, the weaker side will probably retire without
risking a contest.  With a common purpose, therefore, the respective
generals will select a broad stretch of level ground for the
struggle, since stony, hilly, or uneven ground will never do for
the maneuvering of hoplites.  The two armies, after having duly
come in sight of one another, and exchanged defiances by derisive
shouts, catcalls, and trumpetings, will probably each pitch its camp
(protected by simple fortifications) and perhaps wait over night,
that the men may be well rested and have a good dinner and breakfast.
The soldiers will be duly heartened up by being told of any lucky
omens of late,--how three black crows were seen on the right, and
a flash of lightning on the left; and the seers and diviners with
the army will, at the general's orders, repeat any hopeful oracles
they can remember or fabricate, e.g. predicting ruin for Thebes,
or victory for Athens.  In the morning the soldiers have breakfast,
then the lines are carefully arrayed a little beyond bowshot from
the enemy, who are preparing themselves in similar fashion.  Every
man has his arms in order, his spear point and sword just from the
whetstone, and every buckle made fast.  The general (probably in
sight of all the men) will cause the seers to kill a chicken, and
examine its entrails.  "The omens are good; the color is favorable;
the gods are with us!"[*] he announces; and then, since he is
a Greek among Greeks, he delivers in loud voice an harangue to as
many as can hear him, setting forth the patriotic issues at stake
in the battle, the call of the fatherland to its sons, the glory
of brave valor, the shame of cowardice, probably ending with some
practical directions about "Never edging to the right!" and exhorting
his men to raise as loud a war-cry as possible, both to encourage
themselves and to demoralize the enemy.

[*]It may be suspected that it was very seldom the omens were
ALLOWED to be unfavorable when the general was really resolved on
battle.


93.  Joining the Battle.--The troops answer with a cheer then join
in full chorus in the "P√¶an--" a fierce rousing charging-song that
makes every faint-heart's blood leap faster.  Another p√¶an bellowed
from the hostile ranks indicates that similar preliminaries have been
disposed of there.  The moment the fierce chorus ends, the general
(who probably is at the post of danger and honor--the right wing)
nods to his corps of pipers.  The shrill flutes cut the air.  The
whole phalanx starts forward like one man, and the enemy seem springing
to meet it.  The tossing color, the flashing arms and armor, make
it a sight for men and gods.  If the enemy has a powerful archery
force, as had the Persians at Marathon, then the phalanx is allowed
to advance on the run,--for at all costs one must get through the
terrible zone of the arrow fire and come to grips; but if their
bowmen are weak, the hoplites will be restrained,--it is better
not to risk getting the phalanx disorganized.  Running or marching
the troops will emit a terrible roaring:  either the slow deep "A!
la! la! la!" or something quicker, "Eluleu!"  "Eluleu!" and the
flutes will blow all the while to give the time for the marching.

Closer at hand the two armies will fairly spring into unfriendly
embrace.  The generals have each measured his enemy's line and
extended his own to match it.[*]  With files of about equal depth,
and well-trained men on both sides, the first stage of the death
grapple is likely to be a most fearful yet indecisive pushing:
the men of the front ranks pressing against each other, shield to
shield, glaring out of their helmets like wild beasts against the
foeman three feet away, and lunging with their lances at any opening
between the hostile shields or above them.  The comrades behind
wedge in the front ranks closer and closer.  Men are crushed to
death, probably without a wound, just by this hellish impact.  The
shouts and yells emitted are deafening.  There is an unearthly
clashing of steel weapons on bronze armor.  Every now and then a
shrill, sharp cry tells where a soldier has been stabbed, and has
gone down in the press, probably trampled to death instantly.  In
this way the two writhing, thrusting phalanxes continue to push
on one another at sheer deadlock, until a cool observer might
well wonder whether the battle would not end simply with mutual
extermination.

[*]Any sudden attempt to extend your line BEYOND the foe's, so as
to outflank him, would probably have produced so much confusion in
your own phalanx as to promise certain disaster.  Of course for an
inferior force to accept battle by thinning its line, to be able
by extending to meet the long lines of the enemy, would involve
the greatest risk of being broken through at the center.  The best
remedy for inferior numbers was manifestly to decline a decisive
battle.


94.  The Climax and End of the Battle.--Boot look away now from the
center, towards the two wings.  What the generals of BOTH contending
armies have feared and warned against has come to pass.  Every
hoplite is admirably covered by his great shield on his left side;
but his right is unprotected.  It is almost impossible to resist
the impulse to take a step toward the right to get under the cover
of a comrade's shield.  And he in turn has been edging to the
right likewise.  The whole army ahs in fact done so, and likewise
the whole phalanx of the enemy.  So after a quarter of an hour of
brisk fighting, the two hosts, which began by joining with lines
exactly facing each other, have each edged along so much that each
overlaps the other on the right wing, thus:


+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


What will happen now is easy to predict with assurance up to a
certain point.  The overlapping right wings will EACH promptly turn
the left flank of their enemies, and falling upon the foe front
and rear catch them almost helpless.  The hoplite is an admirable
soldier when standing shoulder to shoulder with his comrades facing
his foe; but once beset in the rear he is so wedged in by the press
that it is next to impossible for him to turn and fight effectively.
Either he will be massacred as he stands or the panic will spread
betimes, and simultaneously both left wings will break formation
and hurry off the field in little better than flight.

Now will come the real test of discipline and deliberate valor.  Both
centers are holding stoutly.  Everything rests on the respective
victorious right wings.  Either they will foolishly forget that
there is still fighting elsewhere on the field, and with ill-timed
huzzaing pursue the men they have just routed, make for their camp
to plunder it, or worse still, disperse to spoil the slain; or,
if they can heed their general's entreaties, keep their ranks,
and wheeling around come charging down on the rear of the enemy's
center.  If one right wing does this, while the hostile right
wing has rushed off in heedless pursuit, the battle is infallibly
won by the men who have kept their heads; but if both right wings
turn back, then the real death grapple comes when these two sets
of victors in the first phase of the contest clash together in a
decisive grapple.

By this time the original phalanx formations, so orderly, and
beautiful, have become utterly shattered.  The field is covered by
little squares or knots of striking, cursing, raging men--clashing
furiously together.  If there are any effective reserves, now is
the time to fling them into the scale.  The hitherto timorous light
troops and armor bearers rush up to do what they can.  Individual
bravery and valor count now to the uttermost.  Little by little the
contest turns against one side or the other.  The crucial moment
comes.  The losing party begins to fear itself about to be surrounded.
Vain are the last exhortations of the officers to rally them.
"Every man for himself!" rings the cry; and with one mad impulse
the defeated hoplites rush off the field in a rout.  Since they
have been at close grip with their enemies, and now must turn
their ill-protected backs to the pursuing spears, the massacre of
the defeated side is sometimes great.  Yet not so great as might
be imagined.  Once fairly beaten, you must strip off helmet and
cuirass, cast away shield and spear, and run like a hare.  You
have lightened yourself now decidedly.  But your foe must keep HIS
ponderous arms, otherwise he cannot master you, if he overtakes
you.  Therefore the vanquished can soon distance the victors unless
the latter have an unusually efficient cavalry and javelin force.
However, the victors are likely to enter the camp of the vanquished,
and to celebrate duly that night dividing the plunder.


95.  The Burial Truce and the Trophy after the Battle.--A few
hours after the battle, while the victors are getting breath and
refreshing themselves, a shamefaced herald, bearing his sacred
wand of office, presents himself.  He is from the defeated army,
and comes to ask a burial truce.  This is the formal confession of
defeat for which the victors have been waiting.  It would be gross
impiety to refuse the request; and perhaps the first watch of the
nigh is spent by detachments of both sides in burying or burning
the dead.

The fates of prisoners may be various.  They may be sold as slaves.
If the captors are pitiless and vindictive, it is not contrary to
the laws of war to put the prisoners to death in cold blood; but
by the fourth century B.C. Greeks are becoming relatively humane.
Most prisoners will presently be released against a reasonable
ransom paid by their relatives.

The final stage of the battle is the trophy:  the visible sign on
the battlefield that here such-and-such a side was victorious.  The
limbs are lopped off a tree, and some armor captured from the foe
is hung upon it.  After indecisive battles sometimes both sides
set up trophies; in that case a second battle is likely to settle
the question.  Then when the victors have recovered from their
own happy demoralization, they march into the enemy's country; by
burning all the farmsteads, driving off the cattle, filling up the
wells, girdling the olive and fruit trees, they reduce the defeated
side (that has fled to its fortified town) to desperation.  If
they have any prisoners, they threaten to put them to death.  The
result, of course, is frequently a treaty of peace in favor of the
victors.


96.  The Siege of Fortified Towns.--If, however, one party cannot
be induced to risk an open battle; or if, despite a defeat, it allows
the enemy to ravage the fields, and yet persists in defending the
walls of its town,--the war is likely to be tedious and indecisive.
It is notorious that Greeks dislike hard sieges.  The soldiers
are the fellow townsmen of the generals.  If the latter order an
assault with scaling ladders and it is repulsed with bloody loss,
the generals risk a prosecution when they get home for "casting
away the lives of their fellow citizens."[*]  In short, fifty men
behind a stout wall and "able to throw anything" are in a position
to defy an army.

[*]In siege warfare Oriental kings had a great advantage over Greek
commanders.  The former could sacrifice as many of their "slaves"
as they pleased, in desperate assaults.  The latter had always to
bear in mind their accountability at home for any desperate and
costly attack.

The one really sure means of taking a town is to build a counter
wall around it and starve it out,--a slow and very expensive,
thought not bloody process.  Only when something very great is at
stake will a Greek city-state attempt this.[*]  There is always
another chance, however.  Almost every Greek town has a discontented
faction within its walls, and many a time there will be a traitor
who will betray a gate to the enemy; and then the siege will be
suddenly ended in one murderous night.

[*]As in the siege of Potidea (432-429 B.C.), when if Athens had
failed to take the place, her hold upon her whole empire would have
been jeopardized.


97.  The Introduction of New Tactics.--Greek battles are thus very
simple things as a rule.  It is the general who, accepting the
typical conditions as he finds them, and avoiding any gross and
obvious blunders, can put his men in a state of perfect fitness,
physical and moral, that is likely to win the day.  Of late there
has come indeed a spirit of innovation.  At Leuctra (371 B.C.)
Epaminodas the Theban defeated the Spartans by the unheard-of
device of massing a part of his hoplites fifty deep (instead of
the orthodox eight or twelve) and crushing the Spartan right wing
by the sheer weight of his charge, before the rest of the line
came into action at all.  If the experiment had not succeeded,
Epaminondas would probably have been denounced by his own countrymen
as a traitor, and by the enemy as a fool, for varying from the
time-honored long, "even line" phalanx; and the average general will
still prefer to keep to the old methods; then if anything happens,
HE at least will not be blamed for any undue rashness.  Only in
Macedon, King Philip II (who is just about to come to the throne)
will not hesitate to study the new battle tactics of Epaminondas,
and to improve upon them.

The Athenians will tell us that their citizen hoplites are a match
for any soldiers in Greece, except until lately the Spartans, and
now (since Leuctra) possibly the Thebans.  But Corinthians, Argives,
Sicyonians, they can confront more readily.  They will also add,
quite properly, that the army of Athens is in the main for home
defense.  She does not claim to be a pre√´minently military state.
The glory of Athens has been the mastery of the sea.  Our next
excursion must surely be to the Peir√¶us.





Chapter XIV.  The Peir√¶us and the Shipping.




98.  The "Long Walls" down to the Harbor Town.--It is some five
miles from the city to the Peir√¶us, and the most direct route this
time lies down the long avenue laid between the Long Walls, and
running almost directly southwest.[*]  The ground is quite level.
If we could catch glimpses beyond the walls, we would see fields,
seared brown perhaps by the summer sun, and here and there a
bright-kerchiefed woman gleaning among the wheat stubble.  The two
walls start from Athens close together and run parallel for some
distance, then they gradually diverge so as to embrace within their
open angle a large part of the circumference of the Peir√¶us.  This
open space is built up with all kinds of shops, factories, and
houses, usually of the less aristocratic kind.  In fact, all the
noxious sights and odors to be found in Athens seem tenfold multiplied
as we approach the Peir√¶us.

[*]These were the walls whereof a considerable section was thrown
down by Lysander after the surrender of Athens [404 B.C.].  The
demolition was done to the "music of flute girls," and was fondly
thought by the victors to mean the permanent crippling of Athens,
and therefore "the first day of the liberty of Greece."  In 393
B.C., by one of the ironies of history, Conon, an Athenian admiral,
but in the service of the king of Persia, who was then at war with
Sparta, appeared in the Peir√¶us, and WITH PERSIAN MEN AND MONEY
rebuilt the walls amid the rejoicings of the Athenians.

The straight highroad is swarming with traffic:  clumsy wagons are
bringing down marble from the mountains; other wains are headed
toward Athens with lumber and bales of foreign wares.  Countless
donkeys laden with panniers are being flogged along.  A great deal
of the carrying is done by half-naked sweating porters; for, after
all, slave-flesh is almost as cheap as beast-flesh.  So by degrees
the two walls open away from us:  before us now expands the humming
port town; we catch the sniff of the salt brine, and see the tangle
of spars of the multifarious shipping.  Right ahead, however,
dominating the whole scene, is a craggy height,--the hill of Munychia,
crowned with strong fortifications, and with houses rising terrace
above terrace upon its slopes.  At the very summit glitters in its
white marble and color work the temple of Artemis Munychia, the
guardian goddess of the port town and its citadel.[*]

[*]This fortress of Munychia, rather than the Acropolis in Athens
was the real citadel of Attica.  It dominated the all-important
harbors on which the very life of the state depended.


99.  Munychia and the Havens of Athens.--Making our way up a steep
lane upon the northwestern slope, we pass within the fortifications,
the most formidable near Athens.  A band of young ephebi of
the garrison eye us as we enter; but we seem neither Spartans nor
Thebans and are not molested.  From a convenient crag near the
temple, the whole scheme of the harbors of Athens is spread out
before us, two hundred and eighty odd feet below.  Behind us is
the familiar plain of Athens with the city, the Acropolis, and the
guardian mountains.  Directly west lies the expanse of roof of the
main harbor town, and then beyond is the smooth blue expanse of
the "Port of the Peir√¶us," the main mercantile harbor of Athens.
Running straight down from Munychia, southwest, the land tapers off
into a rocky promontory, entirely girt with strong fortifications.
In this stretch of land are two deep round indentations.  Cups
of bright water they seem, communicating with the outer sea only
by narrow entrances which are dominated by stout castles.  "Zea"
is the name of the more remote; the "haven" of "Munychia" is that
which seems opening almost at our feet.  These both are full of
the naval shipping, whereof more hereafter.  To the eastward, and
stretching down the coast, is a long sandy beach whereon the blue
ripples are crumbling between the black fishing boats drawn up
upon the strand.  This is Phaleron, the old harbor of Athens before
Themistocles fortified the "Peir√¶us"--merely an open roadstead in
fact, but still very handy for small craft, which can be hauled up
promptly to escape the tempest.


100.  The Glorious View from the Hill of Munychia.--These are
the chief points in the harbors; but the view from Munychia is
most extensive.  Almost everything in sight has its legend or its
story in sober history.  Ten miles away to the southward rise the
red rocky hills of √Ügina, Athens' old island enemy; and the tawny
headlands of the Argolic coasts are visible yet farther across he
horizon.  Again as we follow the purplish ridge of Mount √Ügaleos
as it runs down the Attic coast to westward, we come to a headland
then to a belt of azure water, about a mile wide, then the reddish
hills of an irregular island.  Every idler on the citadel can tell
us all the story.  On that headland on a certain fateful morning
sat Xerxes, lord of the Persians, with his sword-hands and mighty
men about him and his ships before him, to look down on the naval
spectacle and see how his slaves would fight.  The island beyond
is "holy Salamis," and in this narrow strip of water has been
the battle which saved the life of Hellas.  Every position in the
contest seems clearly in sight, even the insignificant islet of
Psytteleia, where Aristeides had landed his men after the battle,
and massacred the Persions stationed there "to cut off the Greeks
who tried to escape."

The water is indescribably blue, matching the azure of the sky.
Ships of all kinds under sails or oars are moving lightly over the
havens and the open Saronic bay.  It is matchless spectacle--albeit
very peaceful.  We now descend to the Peir√¶us proper and examine
the merchant shipping and wharves, leaving the navy yards and the
fighting triremes till later.


101.  The Town of Peir√¶us.--The Peir√¶us has all the life of the
Athenian Agora many times multiplied.  Everywhere there is work
and bustle.  Aristophanes has long since described the impression
it makes on strangers,[*]--sailors clamoring for pay, rations
being served out, figureheads being burnished, men trafficking for
corn, for onions, for leeks, for figs,--"wreaths, anchovies, flute
girls, blackened eyes, the hammering of oars from the dock yards,
the fitting of rowlocks, boatswains' pipes, fifes, and whistling."
There is such confusion one can hardly analyze one's surroundings.
However, we soon discover the Peir√¶us has certain advantages over
Athens itself.  The streets are much wider and are quite straight,[+]
crossing at right angles, unlike the crooked alleys of old Athens
which seem nothing but built-up cow trails.  Down at the water
front of the main harbor ("the Peir√¶us" harbor to distinguish it
from Zea and Munychia) we find about one third, nearest the entrance
passage and called the Cantharus, reserved for the use of the
war navy.  This section is the famous "Emporium," which is such
a repository of foreign wares that Isocrates boasts that here one
can easily buy all those things which it is extremely hard to purchase
anywhere else in Hellas.  Along the shore run five great stoas or
colonnades, all used by the traders for different purposes;--among
them are the Long Stoa (Makra' Stoa'), the "Deigma" (see section
78) used as a sample house by the wholesalers, and the great Corn
Exchange built by Pericles.  Close down near the wharves stands also
a handsome and frequented temple, that of Athena Euploia (Athena,
Giver of good Voyages), to whom many a shipman offers prayer
ere hoisting sail, and many another comes to pay grateful vows
after surviving a storm.[&]  Time fails us for mentioning all the
considerable temples farther back in the town.  The Peir√¶us in
short is a semi-independent community; with its shrines, its agoras,
its theaters, its court rooms, and other public buildings.  The
population contains a very high percentage of metics, and downright
Barbarians,--indeed, long-bearded Babylonians, clean bronze Egyptians,
grinning Ethiopians, never awaken the least comment, they are so
familiar.

[*]"Acharn."  54 ff.

[+]Pericles employed the famous architect Hippodamus to lay out
the Peir√¶us.  It seems to have been arranged much like many of the
newer American cities.

[&]There seems to have been still another precinct, sacred to
"Zeus and Athena the Preservers," where it was very proper to offer
thanksgivings after a safe voyage.


102.  The Merchant Shipping.--We can now cast more particular
eyes upon the shipping.  Every possible type is represented.  The
fishing craft just now pulling in with loads of shining tunnies
caught near √Ügina are of course merely broad open boats, with only
a single dirty orange sail swinging in the lagging breeze.  Such
vessels indeed depend most of the time upon their long oars.  Also
just now there goes across the glassy surface of the harbor a slim
graceful rowing craft, pulling eight swiftly plying oars to a side.
She is a "Lembus:"  probably the private cutter of the commandant
of the port.  Generally speaking, however, we soon find that all
the larger Greek ships are divided into two categories, the "long
ships" and the "round ships."  The former depend mainly on oars
and are for war; the latter trust chiefly to sail power and are
for cargo.  The craft in the merchant haven are of course nearly
all of this last description.

Greeks are clever sailors.  They never feel really happy at a great
distance from the sea which so penetrates their little country;
nevertheless, they have not made all the progress in navigation
which, considering the natural ingenuity of the race, might well
be expected.  The prime difficulty is that Greek ships very seldom
have comfortable cabins.  The men expect to sleep on shore every
night possible.  Only in a great emergency, or when crossing an
exceptionally wide gulf or channel,[*] can a captain expect the
average crew to forego the privilege of a warm supper and bivouac
upon the strand.  This means (since safe anchorages are by no means
everywhere) the ships must be so shallow and light they can often
be hauled up upon the beach.  Even with a pretty large crew,
therefore, the limit to a manageable ship is soon reached; and
during the whole of the winter season all long-distance voyaging
has to be suspended; while, even in summer, nine sailors out of ten
hug close to the land, despite the fact that often the distance of
a voyage is thereby doubled.

[*]For example, the trip from Crete to Cyrene--which would be
demanded first, before coasting along to Egypt.

However, the ships at Peir√¶us, if not large in size, are numerous
enough.  Some are simply big open boats with details elaborated.
They have a small forecastle and poop built over, but the cargo in
the hold is exposed to all wind and weather.  The propulsion comes
from a single unwieldy square sail swinging on a long yard the whole
length of the vessel.  Other ships are more completely decked, and
depend on two square sails in the place of one.  A few, however,
are real "deep sea" vessels--completely decked, with two or even
three masts; with cabins of tolerable size, and forward and aft
curious projections, like turrets,--the use whereof is by no means
obvious, but we soon gather that pirates still abound on the distant
seas, and that these turrets are useful when it comes to repelling
boarders.  The very biggest of these craft run up to 250 gross tons
(later day register),[*] although with these ponderous defense-works
they seem considerably larger.  The average of the ships, however,
will reckon only 30 to 40 tons or even smaller.  It is really a
mistake, any garrulous sailor will tell us, to build merchant ships
much bigger.  It is impossible to make sailing vessels of the Greek
model and rig sail very close to the wind; and in every contrary
breeze or calm, recourse must be had to the huge oars pile up along
the gunwales.  Obviously it is weary work propelling a large ship
with oars unless you have a huge and expensive crew,--far better
then to keep to the smaller vessels.

[*]The Greeks reckoned their ships by their capacity in talents
(= about 60 lbs.), e.g. a ship of 500 talents, of 2000, or (among
the largest) 10,000.


103.  The Three War Harbors and the Ship House.--Many other points
about these "round ships" interest us; but such matters they share
with the men-of-war, and our inspection has now brought us to the
navy yard.  There are strictly three separate navy yards, one at
each of the harbors of Munychia, Zea, and Cantharus, for the naval
strength of Athens is so great that it is impossible to concentrate
the entire fleet at one harbor.  Each of these establishments is
protected by having two strong battlements or breakwaters built
out, nearly closing the respective harbor entrances.  At the end of
each breakwater is a tower with parapets for archers, and capstans
for dragging a huge chain across the harbor mouth, thus effectively
sealing the entrance to any foe.[*]  The Zea haven has really the
greatest warship capacity, but the Cantharus is a good type for
the three.[+]  As we approach it from the merchant haven, we see
the shelving shore closely lined with curious structures which do
not easily explain themselves.  There are a vast number of dirty,
shelving roofs, slightly tilted upward towards the land side, and
set at right angles to the water's edge.  They are each about 150
feet long, some 25 feet wide, about 20 feet high, and are set up side
by side with no passage between.  On close inspection we discover
these are ship houses.  Under each of the roofs is accommodated the
long slim hull of a trireme, kept safe from sea and weather until
the time of need, when a few minutes' work at a tackle and capstan
will send it down into harbor, ready to tow beside a wharf for
outfitting.

[*]Ancient harbors were much harder to defend than modern ones,
because there was no long-range artillery to prevent an enemy from
thrusting into an open haven among defenseless shipping.

[+]Zea had accommodation for 196 triremes, Munychia, 82, and the
Cantharus, 94.


104.  The Great Naval Arsenal.--The ship houses are not the only
large structures at the navy yard.  Here is also the great naval
arsenal, a huge roofed structure open at the sides and entirely
exposed to public inspection.  Here between the lines of supporting
columns can be seen stacked up the staple requisites for the
ships,--great ropes, sail boxes, anchors, oars, etc.  Everybody
in Athens is welcome to enter and assure himself that the fleet
can be outfitted at a minute's notice[*]; and at all times crews
of half-naked, weather-beaten sailors are rushing hither and yon,
carrying or removing supplies to and from the wharves where their
ships are lying.

[*]This arsenal was replaced a little later than the hypothetical
time of this narrative by one designed by the famous architect,
Philo.  It was extremely elegant as well as commodious, with handsome
columns, tiled roofs, etc.  In 360 B.C., however, the arsenal seems
to have been a strictly utilitarian structure.


105.  An Athenian Triearch.--Among this unaristocratic crowd we
observe a dignified old gentleman with an immaculate himation and
a long polished cane.  Obsequious clerks and sailing masters are
hanging about him for his orders; it is easy to see that he is a
TRIERARCH--one of the wealthiest citizens on whom it fell, in turn,
at set intervals, to provide the less essential parts of a trireme's
outfit, and at least part of the pay for the crew for one year,
and to be generally responsible for the efficiency and upkeep of
the vessel.[*]  This is a year of peace, and the patriotic pressure
to spend as much on your warship as possible is not so great as
sometimes; still Eustatius, the magnate in question, knows that he
will be bitterly criticized (nay, perhaps prosecuted in the courts)
if he does not do "the generous thing."  He is therefore ordering
an extra handsome figurehead; promising a bonus to the rowing master
if he can get his hands to row in better rhythm than the ordinary
crew; and directing that wine of superior quality be sent aboard for
the men.[+]  It will be an anxious year in any case for Eustathius.
He has ill wishers who will watch carefully to see if the vessel
fails to make a creditable record for herself during the year, and
whether she is returned to the ship house or to the next trierarch
in a state of good repair.  If the craft does not then appear
seaworthy, her last outfitter may be called upon to rebuild her
completely, a matter which will eat up something like a talent.
Public service therefore does not provide beds of roses for the
rich men of Athens.

[*]Just how much of the rigging and what fraction of the pay
of the crew the government provided is by no means clear from our
evidence.  It is certain that a public-spirited and lavish trierarch
could almost ruin himself (unless very wealthy) during the year he
was responsible for the vessel.

[+]According to various passages in Demosthenes, the cost of
a trierachy for a year varied between 40 min√¶ (say $540 [1914 or
$9,304.20 in 2000]) and a talent (about $1000 [1914 or $17,230 in
2000]), very large sums for Athenians.  The question of the amount
of time spent in active service in foreign waters would of course
do much to determine the outlay.

Eustathius goes away towards one of the wharves, where his trireme,
the "Invincible," is moored with her crew aboard her.  Let us
examine a typical Athenian warship.


106.  The Evolution of the Trireme.--The genesis of the trireme
was the old PENTECONTER ("fifty-oar ship") which, in its prime
features, was simply a long, narrow, open hull, with slightly raised
prow and stern cabins, pulling twenty-five oars to a side.  There
are a few penteconters still in existence, though the great naval
powers have long since scorned them.  It was a good while before
the battle of salamis that the Greek sea warriors began to feel the
need of larger warships.  It was impossible to continue the simple
scheme of the penteconter.  To get more oars all on one tier you
must make a longer boat, but you could not increase the beam, for,
if you did, the whole craft would get so heavy that it would not
row rapidly; and the penteconter was already so long in relation
to its beam as to be somewhat unsafe.  A device was needed to get
more oars into the water without increasing the length over much.
The result was the BIREME (two-banker) which was speedily replaced
by the still more efficient TRIREME (three-banker), the standard
battleship of all the Greek navies.[*]

[*]By the end of the fourth century B.C., vessels with four and
five banks of oars (quadriremes and quinqueremes) had become the
regular fighting ships, but they differed probably only in size,
not in principle, from the trireme.


107.  The Hull of a Trireme.--The "Invincible" has a hull of fir
strengthened by a solid oak keel, very essential if she is to be hauled
up frequently.  Her hull is painted black, but there is abundance
of scarlet, bright blue, and gilding upon her prow, stern, and
upper works.  The slim hull itself is about 140 feet long, 14 feet
wide, and rides the harbor so lightly as to show it draws very little
water; for the warship, even more perhaps than the merchantman, is
built on the theory that her crew must drag her up upon the beach
almost every night.

While we study the vessel we are soon told that, although triremes
have been in general use since, say, 500 B.C., nevertheless the
ships that fought at Salamis were decidedly simpler affairs than
those of three generations later.  In those old "aphract" vessels
the upper tier of rowers had to sit exposed on their benches with
no real protection from the enemy's darts; but in the new "cataphract"
ships like the "Invincible" there is a stout solid bulwark built up
to shield the oarsmen from hostile sight and missiles alike.  All
this makes the ships of Demosthene's day much handsomer, taller
affairs than their predecessors which Themistocles commanded;
nevertheless the old and the new triremes have most essentials in
common.  The day is far off when a battleship twenty years old will
be called "hopelessly obsolete" by the naval critics.[*]

[*]There is some reason for believing that an Athenian trireme was
kept in service for many years, with only incidental repairs, and
then could still be counted as fit to take her place in the line
of battle.

The upper deck of the trireme is about eleven feet above the harbor
waves, but the lowest oar holes are raised barely three feet.  Into
the intervening space the whole complicated rowing apparatus has
to be crammed with a good deal of ingenuity.  Running along two
thirds of the length of the hull nearly the whole interior of the
vessel is filled with a series of seats and foot rests rising in
sets of three.  Each man has a bench and a kind of stool beneath
him, and sits close to a porthole.  The feet of the lowest rower
are near the level of the water line; swinging two feet above him
and only a little behind him is his comrade of the second tier;
higher and behind in turn is he of the third.[*]  Running down
the center of the ship on either side of these complicated benches
is a broad, central gangway, just under the upper deck.  Here the
supernumeraries will take refuge from the darts in battle, and here
the regular rowers will have to do most of their eating, resting,
and sleeping when they are not actually on the benches or on shore.

[*]The exact system by which these oar benches were arranged, the
crew taught to swing together (despite the inequalities in the
length of their oars), and several other like problems connected
with the trireme, have received no satisfactory solution by modern
investigators.  [Note from Brett:  Between 1985 and 1987 John
Morrison and John Coates oversaw a reproduction of a trireme which
has an excellent study of bench arrangements and several other
problems connected with the trireme were likely solved.]


108.  The Rowers' Benches of a Trireme.--With her full complement
of rowers the benches of the "Invincible" fairly swarm with life.
There are 62 rowers to the upper tier (thranites), 58 for the middle
tier (zygites), and 54 for the lower (thalamites), each man with
his own individual oar.  The TRHANITES with the longest oars (full
13 feet 6 inches) have the hardest pull and the largest pay, but
not one of the 174 oarsmen holds a sinecure.  In ordinary cruising,
to be sure, the trireme will make use of her sails, to help out a
single bank of oars which must be kept going almost all the time.
Even then it is weary work to break your back for a couple of hours
taking your turn on the benches.  But in battle the trireme almost
never uses sails.  She becomes a vast, many-footed monster, flying
over the foam; and the pace of the three oar banks, swinging
together, becomes maddening.  Behind their bulwarks the rowers can
see little of what is passing.  Everything is dependent upon their
rowing together in absolute rhythm come what may, and giving instant
obedience to orders.  The trireme is in one sense like a latter-day
steamer in her methods of propulsion; but the driving force is 174
straining, panting humans, not insensate water vapor and steel.


109.  The Cabins, Rigging, and Ram of a Trireme.--Forward and aft of
the rowers' benches and the great central gangway are the fore and
stern cabins.  They furnish something akin to tolerable accommodations
for the officers and a favored fraction of the crew.  Above the
forecastle rises a carved proudly curing prow, and just abaft it
are high bulwarks to guard the javelin men when at close quarters
with the foe.  There is also on either side of the prow a huge red
or orange "eye" painted around the hawse holes for the anchors.
Above the stern cabin is the narrow deck reserved for the pilot,
the "governor" of the ship, who will control the whole trireme with
a touch now on one, now on the other, of the huge steering paddles
which swing at the sides near the stern.  Within the stern cabin
itself is the little altar, sacred to the god or goddess to whom
the vessel is dedicated, and on which incense will be burned before
starting on a long cruise and before going into battle.  Two masts
rise above the deck, a tall mainmast nearly amidships, and a much
smaller mast well forward.  On each of these a square sail (red,
orange, blue, or even, with gala ships, purple) will be swung from
a long yard, while the vessel is cruising; but it is useless to set
sails in battle.  One could never turn the ship quickly enough to
complete the maneuvers.  The sails and yards will ordinarily be
sent ashore as the first measure when the admiral signals "clear
ship for action."

We have now examined all of the "Invincible" except for her main
weapon,--her beak; for the trireme is really herself one tremendous
missile to be flung by the well-trained rowers at the ill-starred
foe.  Projecting well in front of the prow and close to the water
line are three heavy metal spurs serrated one above the other,
somewhat thus[*]:

   |_______
   |=======\
   |====|___
   |========\
  =====|______   /=============\  / / */

Let this fang once crush against a foeman's broadside, and his
timbers are crushed in like eggshells.

[*]Probably at Salamis and in the earlier Athenian army the ram
had been composed of a single long, tapering beak.


110.  The Officers and Crew of a Trireme.--So much for the "Invincible"
herself, but obviously she is a helpless thing without an efficient
crew.  The life of an oarsman is far from luxurious, but the pay
seems to be enough to induce a goodly number of THETES (the poorest
class of the Athenian citizens) to accept service, and the rest
can be supplied by hired metics or any kind of foreign nondescript
who can be brought into discipline.  The rowers are of course the
real heart and soul of the trireme; but they are useless without proper
training.  Indeed it was the superior discipline of the Athenian
crews which in the days of Themistocles and Pericles gave Athens
the supremacy of the seas.  The nominal, and sometimes actual,
commander of the trireme is her trierarch; but obviously a cultivated
old gentleman like Eustathius is no man to manage the ship in a
sea fight.  He will name some deputy, perhaps a stout young friend
or a son, for the real naval work.  Even he may not possess great
experience.  The real commander of the "Invincible" is the "governor"
(KYBERNATES), a gnarled old seaman, who has spent all his life upon
the water.  Nominally his main duty is to act as pilot, but actually
he is in charge of the whole ship; and in battle the trierarch (if
aboard) will be very glad to obey all his "suggestions."  Next to
the "governor" there is the PROIREUS, another experienced sailor
who will have especial charge of the forecastle in battle.  Next in
turn are two "oar-masters" (TOIXARCHOI), who are each responsible
for the discipline and working of one of the long rowers' benches;
and following in grade, though highly important, are the KELEUST√ãS,
and the TRI√ãRAUL√ãS, who, by voice and by flute respectively, will
give the time and if needs be encouragement to the rowers.  These
are all the regular officers, but naturally for handling the sails
and anchors some common sailors are desirable.  The "Invincible"
carries 17 of these.  She also has 10 marines (EPIBAT≈í), men trained
to fight in hoplite's armor and to repel boarders.  The Persian
ships at Salamis carried 30 such warriors, and often various Greek
admirals have crowded their decks with these heavy marines; but
the true Athenian sea warrior disdains them.  Given a good helmsman
and well-trained rowers, and you can sink your opponent with your
ram, while he is clumsily trying to board you.  Expert opinion
considers the EPIBAT≈í somewhat superfluous, and their use in most
naval battles as disgracefully unscientific.


111.  A Trireme at Sea.--A trireme, then is an heroic fighting
instrument.  She goes into battle prepared literally to do or die.
If her side is once crushed, she fills with water instantly, and
the enemy will be too busy and too inhumane to do anything but cheer
lustily when they see the water covered with struggling wretches.
But the trireme is also a most disagreeable craft before and after
the battle.  Her light draft sets her tossing on a very mild sea.
In the hot southern climate, with very little ventilation beneath
the upper deck, with nigh two hundred panting, naked human beings
wedged in together below so closely that there is scarce room for
one more, the heat, the smells, the drudgery, are dreadful.  No
wonder the crew demanded that the trierarch and governor "make
shore for the night," or that they weary of the incessant grating
of the heavy oars upon the thole-pins.

Thus the "Invincible" will seem to any squeamish voyager, but not
so to the distant spectator.  For him a trireme is a most marvelous
and magnificent sight.  A sister ship, the "Dana√´,"[*] is just
entering the Peir√¶us from Lemnos (an isle still under the Athenian
sovereignty).  Her upper works have been all brightened for the
home-coming.  Long, brilliant streams trail from her sail yards
and poop.  The flute player is blowing his loudest.  The marines
stand on the forecastle in glittering armor.  A great column of
foam is spouting from her bow.[+]  Her oars, eighty-seven to the
side, pumiced white and hurling out the spray, are leaping back
and forth in perfect unison.  The whole vessel seems a thing of
springing, ardent life.  It is, indeed, a sight to stir the blood.
No later sailing ship in her panoply of canvas, no steam battleship
with her grim turrets and smoking funnels can ever match the
spectacle of a trireme moving in her rhythm and glory.

[*]The Greek ships seem to have been named either for mythological
characters, or for desirable qualities and virtues.

[+]At her best a trireme seems to have been capable of making 8 to
9 knots per hour.


112.  The Tactics of a Naval Battle.--Imagination can now picture
a Greek naval battle, fifty, a hundred, two hundred, or more of these
splendid battleships flying in two hostile lines to the charge.[*]
Round and round they will sail, each pilot watching the moment when
an unlucky maneuver by the foe will leave a chance for an attack;
and then will come the sudden swinging of the helm, the frantic
"Pull hard!" to the oarsmen, the rending crash and shock as the
ram tears open the opponents side, to be followed by almost instant
tragedy.  If the direct attack on the foe's broadside fails, there
is another maneuver.  Run down upon your enemy as if striking bow
to bow; the instant before contact let your aim swerve--a little.
Then call to your men to draw in their oars like lightning while
the enemy are still working theirs.  If your oarsmen can do the
trick in time, you can now ride down the whole of the foemen's
exposed oar bank, while saving your own.  He is left crippled
and helpless, like a huge centipede with all the legs on one side
stripped away.  You can now back off deliberately, run out your
oars, an in cold blood charge his exposed flank.  If he does not
now surrender, his people are dead men.  Excellent to describe!
Not always so excellent in performance.  Everything depends on the
perfect discipline and handiness of your crew.

[*]A more detailed picture of an ancient naval battle and its
tactics can be found in the author's historical novel, "A Victor
of Salamis" (Chap. XXIX).


113.  The Naval Strength of Athens.--The strength of Athens is
still upon the sea.  Despite her defeats in the Peloponnesian War
she has again the first navy in Hellas.  All in all she can send
out 400 triremes and since each trireme represents a crew of over
200 men, this means that Athens can dispose of over 80,000 souls
in her navy, whereof, however, only a minor fraction are Athenian
citizens.  Athens is quite right in thus laying stress upon her
sea power.  Her long walls and the Peir√¶us make her practically an
island.  Even after Ch√¶roneia, Philip of Macedon will be obliged
to give her honorable terms,--she has still her great navy.  Only
after the defeat of her fleet at Amorgos in 322 B.C. will she have
to know all the pangs of vassalage to Macedon.





Chapter XV.  An Athenian Court Trial.




114.  The Frequency of Litigation in Athens.--The visit to the
Peir√¶us and the study of the shipping have not been too long to
prevent a brief visit to one of the most characteristic scenes of
Athenian life--a law court.  Athens is notorious for the fondness
which her citizens display for litigation.  In fact it is a somewhat
rare and exceptionally peaceable, harmless, and insignificant
citizen who is not plaintiff or defendant in some kind of action
every few years or so.  Says Aristophanes, "The cicada [grasshopper]
sings for only a month, but the people of Athens are buzzing with
lawsuits and trials their whole life long."  In the jury courts the
contentious, tonguey man can spread himself and defame his enemies
to his heart's content; and it must be admitted that in a city like
Athens, where everybody seems to know everybody else's business almost
every citizen is likely to have a number both of warm friends and
of bitter enemies.  Athenians do not have merely "cold acquaintances,"
or "business rivals," as will men of the twentieth century.  They
make no pretenses to "Christian charity."  They freely call an
obnoxious individual their "personal foe" (ECHTHROS), and if they
can defeat, humiliate, and ruin him, they bless the gods.  The
usual outlet for such ill-feeling is a fierce and perhaps mutually
destructive lawsuit.

Then too, despite Athenian notions of what constitutes a gentleman,
many citizens are people of utterly penurious, niggardly habits.
Frequently enough the fellow who can discuss all Socrates's theories
with you is quarreling with his neighbor over the loan of salt or
a lamp wick or some meal for sacrifice.[*]  If one of the customary
"club-dinners"[+] is held at his house, he will be caught secreting
some of the vinegar, lamp oil, or lentils.  If he has borrowed
something, say some barley, take care; when he returns it, he will
measure it out in a vessel with the bottom dented inward.  A little
ill feeling, a petty grievance carefully cultivated,--the end in
due time will be a lawsuit, costly far out of proportion to the
originating cause.

[*]Persons of this kidney are delineated to us as typical characters
by Theophrastus.

[+]The nearest modern equivalent is a "basket lunch."


115.  Prosecutions in Athens.--Athens does not draw a sharp line
between public and private litigation.  There is no "state" or
"district attorney" to prosecute for the offenses against public
order.  Any full citizen can prosecute anybody else upon such
a criminal charge as murder, no less than for a civil matter like
breach of contract.  All this leads to the growth of a mischievous
clan--the SYCOPHANTS.  These harpies are professional accusers
who will prosecute almost any rich individual upon whom they think
they can fasten some technical offense.  Their gains are from two
quarters.  If they convict the defendant, about half of the fine
or property taken will go to the informer.  But very likely there
will be no trial.  The victim (either consciously guilty, or
innocent but anxious to avoid the risk) will pay a huge blackmail
at the first threat of prosecution, and the case is hushed up.

It is true there are very heavy penalties for trumped-up cases,
for unwarranted threat of legal proceedings, for perjured evidence;
still the abuse of the sycophants exists, and a great many of the
lawsuits originate with this uncanny tribe.


116.  The Preliminaries to a Trial.--There are official arbitrators
to settle petty cases, but it is too often that one or both parties
declare "the dicasts must settle it," and the lawsuit has to take
its way.  Athenian legal methods are simple.  Theoretically there are
no professional lawyers, and every man must look out for himself.
The first business is to file your complaint with one of the magistrates
(usually one of nine ARCHONS), and then with two witnesses give
formal summons to your opponent, the defendant, to appear on a set
day in court.  If he has defaulted, the case is usually ended then
in your favor.  This hearing before the magistrate is in any event
an important part of the trial.  Here each side proffers the laws
it cites to sustain its claims, and brings its witnesses, who can
be more or less cross-examined.  All the pertinent testimony is
now written down, and the tablets sealed up by the magistrate.  At
the final trial this evidence will be merely READ to the jury, the
witness in each instance standing up before the court and admitting
when duly asked, "This is my testimony on the case."

Free men testify under oath, but a slave's oath is counted worthless.
The slaves may be the only important witnesses to a given act,
but under only one condition can they testify.  With the consent
of their master they may testify UNDER TORTURE.  It is a critical
moment at this hearing when a litigant who is confident of his case
proudly announces, "I challenge my enemy to put my slaves under
torture"; or the other, attacking first, cries out, "I demand that
my enemy submit his slaves to torture."  Theoretically the challenged
party might refuse, practically a refusal is highly dangerous.  "If
his slaves didn't know something bad, why were they kept silent?"
the jury will ask.  So the rack is brought forth.  The wretched
menials are stretched upon it.  One must hope that often the whole
process involves more show of cruelty than actual brutality.  What
now the slaves gasp out between their twists and howls is duly
taken down as "important evidence," and goes into the record.[*]

[*]Athenian opinion was on the whole in favor of receiving as valid
testimony the evidence extorted thus from slaves by mere animal
fear.  Antiphon the orator speaks of how truth may be wrung from
slaves by torture; "by which they are compelled to speak the truth
though they must die for it afterward [at the hands of the master
they have incriminated], for the present necessity is to each
stronger than the future."  This has been well called one of the
few cases of extreme STUPIDITY on the part of the Athenians.


117.  The Athenian Jury Courts.--A convenient interval has elapsed
since one of these preliminary hearings.  To-day has been set for
the actual trial before a member of the archons in the "Green" court.
Ariston, a wealthy olive farmer, is suing Lamachus, an exporter of
the Peir√¶us, for failing to account for the proceeds of a cargo of
olives lately shipped to Naxos.  To follow the trial in its entirety
we should have been at the courthouse at first dawn.  Then we would
have seen the jurymen come grumbling in, some from the suburbs,
attended by link boys.  These jurors represent a large fraction of
the whole Athenian people.  There are about six thousand in all.
Pretty nearly every citizen above thirty years of age can give in
his name as desiring jury duty; but naturally it is the elderly
and the indolent who must prefer the service.  One thousand of the
six act as mere substitutes; the rest serve as often as the working
of a complicated system of drawing by lot assigns them to sit as
jurors on a particular case.  It is well there are five thousand
always thus available, for Athenian juries are very large; 201,
401, 501, 1001 are numbers heard of, and sometimes even greater.[*]
The more important the case, the larger the jury; but "Ariston v.
Lamachus" is only a commonplace affair; 401 jurors are quite enough.
Even with that "small court," the audience which the pleaders now
have to address will seem huge to any latter-day lawyer who is
accustomed to his "twelve men in a box"; and needless to say, quite
different methods must be used in dealing with such a company.

[*]The odd unit was no doubt added to prevent a tie.

Each "dicast" (to use the proper name) has a boxwood tablet to show
at the entrance as his voucher to the Scythian police-archers on
duty; he has also a special staff of the color of the paint on the
door of the court room.[*]  The chamber itself is not especially
elegant; a long line of hard benches rising in tiers for the dicasts,
and facing these a kind of pulpit for the presiding magistrates,
with a little platform for orators, a small alter for the preliminary
sacrifice, and a few stools for attendants and witnesses complete
the simple furnishings.  There are open spaces for spectators,
though no seats; but there will be no lack of an audience today,
for the rumor has gone around, "Hypereides has written Ariston's
argument."  The chance to hear a speech prepared by that famous
oration-monger is enough to bring every dicast out early, and to
summon a swarm of loiterers up from the not distant Agora.

[*]Each court room had is distinguishing color.  There were about
ten regular court rooms, besides some for special tribunals; e.g.
the Areopagus for the trial of homicides.


118.  The Juryman's Oath.--The dicasts are assumed to approach their
duty with all due solemnity.  They have sworn to vote according to
the laws of Athens, never to vote for a repudiation of debts, nor
to restore political exiles, nor to receive bribes for their votes,
nor take bribes in another's behalf, nor let anybody even tempt
them with such proffers.  They are to hear both sides impartially
and vote strictly according to the merits of the case:  and the oath
winds up awfully--"Thus do I invoke Zeus, Poseidon, and Demeter to
smite with destruction me and my house if I violate any of these
obligations, but if I keep them I pray for many blessings."[*]

[*]We have not the exact text of all the dicasts' oath, but we can
reproduce it fairly completely from Demosthenes's "Oration against
Timocrates."


119.  Opening the Trial.  The Plaintiff's Speech.--The oath
is admirable, but the dicasts are not in a wholly juridical state
of mind.  Just before the short sacrifice needful to commence
proceedings, takes place, old Zenosthenes on the second row nudges
his neighbor:  "I don't like the looks of that Lamachus.  I shall
vote against him."  "And I--my wife knows his wife, and--"  The
archon rises.  The crier bids, "Silence!"  The proceedings begin:
but all through the hearing there is whispering and nudging along
the jurors' benches.  The litigants are quite aware of the situation
and are trying their best to win some advantage therefrom.

Ariston is the first to speak.  He has taken great pains with the
folds of his himation and the trim of his beard this morning.  He
must be thoroughly genteel, but avoid all appearances of being a
dandy.  In theory every man has to plead his own case in Athens,
but not every man is an equally good orator.  If a litigant is
very inept, he can simply say a few words, then step aside with "My
friend so-and-so will continue my argument"; and a readier talker
will take his place.[*]  Ariston, however, is a fairly clever
speaker.  Having what he conceives a good case, he has obtained the
indirect services of Hypereides, one of the first of the younger
orators of Athens.  Hyperedies has written a speech which he thinks
is suitable to the occasion, Ariston has memorized it, and delivers
it with considerable gusto.  He has solid evidence, as is proved
from time to time when he stops to call, "Let the clerk read
the testimony of this or that."  There often is a certain hum of
approbation from the dicasts when he makes his points.  He continues
bravely, therefore, ever and anon casting an eye upon the CLEPSYDRA
near at hand, a huge water-clock which, something like an hour
glass, marks off the time allotted him.  Some of his arguments seem
to have nothing to do with the alleged embezzlement.  He vilifies
his opponent:  calls Lamachus's mother coarse names, intimates that
as a boy he had no decent schooling, charges him with cowardice
in the recent Mantinea campaign in which he served, hints that
he has quarreled with his relatives.  On the other hand, Ariston
grandiloquently praises HIMSELF as well born, well educated, an
honorable soldier and citizen, a man any Athenian would be glad to
consider a friend.  It is very plain all these personalia delight
the jury.[+]  When Ariston's "water has run out" and he concludes
his speech, there is a loud murmur of applause running along the
benches of the dicasts.

[*]These "friends," however, were never regularly professional
advocates; it would have been ruinous to let the jury get the
impression that an orator was being directly hired to speak to
them.

[+]For the depths of personal insult into which Greek litigants could
descend there is no better instance than Demosthenes's (otherwise
magnificent) "Oration on the Crown," wherein he castigates his foe
√Üschines.


120.  The Defendant's Speech.  Demonstrations by the Jury.--It is
now Lamachus's turn.  He also has employed a professional speech-writer
("logographos") of fame, Is√¶us, to prepare his defense.  But almost
at the outset he is in difficulties.  Very likely he has a bad case
to begin with.  He makes it worse by a shrill, unpleasant voice
and ungainly gestures.  Very soon many dicasts are tittering and
whispering jibes to their companions.  As his harangue proceeds,
the presiding archon (who has really very little control of the
dicasts) is obliged "to remind the gentlemen of the jury that the
have taken solemn oath to hear both sides of the question."

Lamachus fights doggedly on.  Having put in all his real arguments,
he takes refuge also in blackguarding his opponent.  Did Ariston
get his wealth honestly? was not his father a rascally grain dealer
who starved the people?  Yet there is still more impatience among
the dicasts.  Lamachus now uses his last weapon.  Upon the pleader's
stand clamber his five young children clad in black mourning
garments.  They all weep together, and when not wiping their eyes,
hold out their hands like religious suppliants, toward the dicasts.[*]

[*]For such an appeal to an Athenian dicastery, see Aristophanes's
"Wasps."  The pertinent passages are quoted in "Readings in Ancient
History," vol. I, p. 238-40.

"Ah! Gentlemen of the jury," whines their father, "if you are moved
by the voices of your lambs at home, pity these here.  Acquit me
for THEIR sakes.  Do not find against me and plunge these innocent
darlings into want and misery, by impoverishing their father."

Appeals like this have swayed more than one jury during the last
year, but the fates are all against Lamachus.  From a back bench
comes a dreaded shout that is instantly caught up by the front
tiers also:

"Kataba! Kataba!--Go down! Go Down!"

Lamachus hesitates.  If he obeys, he loses all the rest of his
defense.  If he continues now, he enrages many of the dicasts, who
will be absolutely sure to find against him.  The presiding archon
vainly rises, and tries to say something about "fair play."  Useless.
The uproar continues.  Like a flock of scared doves Lamachus and
all his five children flee incontinently from the tribune, amid
ironical cheers and laughter.


121.  The First Verdict.--There is silence at length.  "The dicasts
will proceed to vote," announces the court crier.  The huge urns
(one of bronze, one of wood) with narrow mouths are passed among
the benches.  Each juror has two round bronze disks, one solid,
one with a hole bored in the middle.  The solid acquit, the pierced
ones convict.  A juror drops the ballot he wishes to count into
the bronze urn; the other goes into the wooden urn.  The bronze
urn is carried to the archon, and there is an uneasy hush while the
401 ballots are counted by the court officers.  As expected, more
than 300 dicasts vote that Ariston is entitled to damages against
Lamachus as an embezzler.


122.  The Second and Final Verdict.--Ariston is smiling; his
friends are congratulating him, but the trial is by no means over.
If Lamachus had been found guilty of something for which the
law provided an absolute fixed penalty, this second part of the
proceedings would be omitted.  But here, although the jury has
said SOME damage or penalty or penalties are due, it has still to
fix the amount.  Ariston has now to propose to the dicasts a sum
which he thinks is adequate to avenge his wrongs and losses; Lamachus
can propose a smaller sum and try to persuade the court that it is
entirely proper.  Each side must act warily.  Athenian jurors are
fickle folk.  The very men who have just howled down Lamachus may,
in a spasm of repentance, vote for absurdly low damages.  Again,
Lamachus must not propose anything obviously inadequate, otherwise
the jurors who have just voted against him may feel insulted,
and accept Ariston's estimate.[*]  Ariston therefore says that he
deserves at least a talent.  Lamachus rejoins that half a talent
is more than ample, even conceding Arison's alleged wrongs.  The
arguments this time are shorter and more to the point.  Then comes
the second balloting.  A second time a majority (smaller this time,
but enough) is in favor of Ariston.  The better cause has conquered;
and there is at least this advantage to the Athenian legal system,
there will be no appeal nor tedious technicalities before a "higher
court."  The verdict of the dicastery is final.

[*]Undoubtedly Socrates would have escaped with his life, if (after
his original condemnation) he had proposed a real penalty to the
jury, instead of an absurdly small fine.  The only alternative for
the dicasts was to accept the proposition of his opponents,--in
his case, death.


123.  The Merits and Defects of the Athenian Courts.--No doubt
injustice is sometimes done.  Sometimes it is the honest man who
hears the dreaded "Kataba!"  Sometimes the weeping children have
their intended effect.  Sometimes it is the arguments about "My
opponent's scoundrelly ancestry" which win the verdict.  At the
same time, your Athenian dicast is a remarkably shrewd and acute
individual.  He can distinguish between specious rhetoric and a
real argument.  He is probably honestly anxious to do justice.  In
the ordinary case where his personal interests or prejudices do
not come into play, the decision is likely to match with justice
quite as often perhaps as in the intricate court system of a great
republic many centuries after the passing of Athens.

Certain features of some Athenian trials have not explained
themselves in the example just witnessed.  To prevent frivolous or
blackmailing litigation it is provided that, if the plaintiff in
a suit gets less than one fifth of the ballots in his favor (thus
clearly showing he had no respectable case), he is liable to a heavy
fine or, in default thereof, exile.  Again, we have not waited for
the actual closing scene--the dicasts each giving up his colored
staff as a kind of voucher to the court officers, and in return
getting his three obols (9 cents) daily jury fee, which each man
claps promptly in his cheek, and then goes off home to try the case
afresh at the family supper.


124.  The Usual Punishments in Athens.--Trials involving murder or
manslaughter come before the special court of Areopagus, and cannot
well be discussed here, but most other criminal cases are tried
before the dicasts in much the same way as a civil trial.  When the
law does not have a set penalty, the jury virtually has to sentence
the defendant after convicting him, choosing between one of two
proposed penalties.  Greek courts can inflict death, exile, fines,
but almost never imprisonment.  There is no "penitentiary" or
"workhouse" in Athens; and the only use for a jail is to confine
accused persons whom it is impossible to release on bail before
their trial.  The Athens city jail ("The House," as it is familiarly
called--"Oikema") is a very simple affair, one open building,
carelessly guarded and free to visitors all through the daylight.
The inmates have to be kept in heavy fetters, otherwise they would
be sure to take flight; and indeed escapes from custody are somewhat
common.


125.  The Heavy Penalty of Exile.--An Athenian will regard locking
a criminal up for a term of years as a very foolish and expensive
proceeding.  If he has nothing wherewith to pay a round fine, why,
simply send him into exile.  This penalty is direful indeed to a
Greek.  The exile has often no protector, no standing in the courts
of the foreign city, no government to avenge any outrage upon him.
He can be insulted, starved, stripped, nay, murdered, often with
impunity.  Worse still, he is cut off from his friends with whom
all his life is tied up; he is severed from the guardian gods of
his childhood,--"THE City," the city of his birth, hopes, longings,
exists no more for him.  If he dies abroad, he is not sure of a
decent funeral pyre; and meanwhile his children may be hungering
at home.  So long as the Athenians have this tremendous penalty of
exile at their disposal, they do not feel the need of penitentiaries.


126.  The Death Penalty at Athens.--There are also the stocks and
whipping posts for meting out summary justice to irresponsible
offenders.  When the death penalty is imposed (and the matter
often lies in the discretion of the dicasts), the criminal, if of
servile or Barbarian blood, may be put to death in some hideous
manner and his corpse tossed into the Barathron, a vile pit on the
northwest side of Athens, there to be dishonored by the kites and
crows.  The execution of Athenian citizens, however, is extremely
humane.  The condemned is given a cup of poisonous hemlock juice
and allowed to drink it while sitting comfortably among his friends
in the prison.  Little by little his body grows numb; presently
he becomes senseless, and all is over without any pain.[*]  The
friends of the victim are then at liberty to give his body a suitable
burial.

[*]No one can read the story of the death of Socrates in the prison,
as told by Plato in the "Ph√¶do," without feeling (aside from the
noble philosophical setting) how much more humane were such executions
by hemlock than is the modern gallows or electric chair.

An Athenian trial usually lasts all day, and perhaps we have been
able to witness only the end of it.  It may well happen, however,
that we cannot attend a dicastery at all.  This day may be one which
is devoted to a meeting of the public assembly, and duty summons
the jurors, not in the court room, but to the Pnyx.  This is no
loss to us, however.  We welcome the chance to behold the Athenian
Ecclesia in action.





Chapter XVI.  The Ecclesia of Athens.




127.  The Rule of Democracy in Athens.--The Ecclesia, or Public
Assembly, of Athens is something more than the chief governmental
organ in the state.  It is the great leveling engine which makes
Athens a true democracy, despite the great differences in wealth
between her inhabitants, and the marked social pretensions of "the
noble and the good"--the educated classes.  At this time Athens
is profoundly wedded to her democratic constitution.  Founded by
Solon and Clisthenes, developed by Themistocles and Pericles, it
was temporarily overthrown at the end of the Peloponnesian War;
but the evil rule then of the "Thirty Tyrants" has proved a better
lesson on the evils of oligarchic rule than a thousand rhetoricians'
declamations upon the advantages of the "rule of the many" as
against the "rule of the few."  Attica now acknowledges only one
Lord--KING DEMOS--"King Everybody"--and until the coming of bondage to
Macedon there will be no serious danger of an aristocratic reaction.


128.  Aristocracy and Wealth.  Their Status and Burdens.--True,
there are old noble families in Athens,--like the Alcm√¶onid√¶
whereof Pericles sprang, and the Eumolpid√¶ who supply the priests
to Demeter, the Earth Mother.  But these great houses have long
since ceased to claim anything but SOCIAL pre√´minence.  Even then
one must take pains not to assume airs, or the next time one is
litigant before the dicastery, the insinuation of "an undemocratic,
oligarchic manner of life" will win very many adverse votes among
the jury.  Nobility and wealth are only allowed to assert themselves
in Athens when justified by an extraordinary amount of public
service and public generosity.

Xenophon in his "Memorabilia" makes Socrates tell Critobuls, a
wealthy and self-important individual, that he is really so hampered
by his high position as to be decidedly poor.  "You are obliged,"
says Socrates, "to offer numerous and magnificent sacrifices; you
have to receive and entertain sumptuously a great many strangers,
and to feast [your fellow] citizens.  You have to pay heavy contributions
towards the public service, keeping horses and furnishing choruses
in peace times and in war bearing the expense of maintaining triremes
and paying the special war taxes; and if you fail to do all this,
they will punish you with as much severity as if you were caught
stealing their money."


129.  Athenian Society Truly Democratic up to a Certain Point.--Wealth,
then, means one perpetual round of public services and obligations,
sweetened perhaps with a little empty praise, an inscription, an
honorary crown, or best of all, an honorary statue "to the public
benefactor" as the chief reward.  On the other hand one may be
poor and be a thoroughly self-respecting, nay, prominent citizen.
Socrates had an absurdly small invested fortune and the gods knew
that he did little enough in the way of profitable labor.[*]  He
had to support his wife and three children upon this income.  He
wore no chiton.  His himation was always an old one, unchanged
from summer to winter.  He seems to have possessed only one pair
of good sandals all his life.  His rations were bread and water,
save when he was invited out.  Yet this man was welcome in the "very
best society."  Alcibiades, leader of the fast, rich set, and many
more of the gilded youth of Athens dogged his heels.  One meets not
the slightest evidence that his poverty ever prevented him from
carrying his philosophic message home to the wealthy and the noble.
There is no snobbishness, then, in this Athenian society.  Provided
a man is not pursuing a base mechanic art or an ignoble trade,
provided he has a real message to convey,--whether in literature,
philosophy, or statecraft,--there are no questions "who was
your father?" or "what is your income?"[+]  Athens will hear him
and accept his best.  For this open-mindedness--almost unique in
ancient communities--one must thank King Demos and his mouthpiece,
the Ecclesia.

[*]Socrates's regular income from invested property seems to have
been only about $12 per year.  It is to be hoped his wife, Xanthippe,
had a little property of her own!

[+]Possibly the son of a man whose parents notoriously had been
slaves in Athens would have found many doors closed to him.

Athenians are intensely proud of their democracy.  In √Üschylus's
"Persians," Atossa, the Barbarian queen, asks concerning the
Athenians:--


"Who is the lord and shepherd of their flock?"


Very prompt is the answer:--


"They are not slaves, they bow to no man's rule."


Again in Euripides's "Supplicants" there is this boast touching
Athens:--


       "No will of one
Holdeth this land:  it is a city and free.
The whole folk year by year, in parity of service is our king."


130.  The Voting Population of Athens.--Nevertheless when we ask
about this "whole folk," and who the voters are, we soon discover
that Athens is very far from being a pure democracy.  The multitudes
of slaves are of course without votes, and so is the numerous
class of the important, cultivated, and often wealthy metics.  To
get Athenian citizenship is notoriously hard.  For a stranger (say
a metic who had done some conspicuous public service) to be given
the franchise, a special vote must be passed by the Ecclesia itself;
even then the new citizen may be prosecuted as undeserving before
a dicastery, and disfranchised.  Again, only children both of whose
parents are free Athenian citizens can themselves be enrolled on the
carefully guarded lists in the deme books.  The status of a child,
one of whose parents is a metic, is little better than a bastard.[*]

[*]Of course women were entirely excluded from the Ecclesia, as from
all other forms of public life.  The question of "woman's rights"
had been agitated just enough to produce comedies like Aristophanes's
"Parliament of Women," and philosophical theories such as appear
in Plato's "Republic."

Under these circumstances the whole number of voters is very much
less than at a later day will appear in American communities of
like population.  Before the Peloponneisan War, when the power of
Athens was at its highest point, there were not less than 30,000
full citizens and possibly as many as 40,000.  But those days of
imperial power are now ended.  At present Athens has about 21,000
citizens, or a few more.  It is impossible, however, to gather all
these in any single meeting.  A great number are farmers living
in the remote villages of Attica; many city dwellers also will be
too busy to think the 3-obol (9-cent [1914 or $1.55 2000]) fee for
attendance worth their while.[*]  Six thousand seems to be a good
number for ordinary occasions and no doubt much business can be
dispatched with less, although this is the legal quorum set for most
really vital matters.  Of course a great crisis, e.g. a declaration
of war, will bring out nearly every voter whose farm is not too
distant.

[*]Payment for attendance at the Pnyx seems to have been introduced
about 390 B.C.  The original payment was probably only one obol,
and then from time to time increased.  It was a sign of the relative
decay of political interest in Athens when it became needful thus
to reward the commonalty for attendance at the Assembly.


131.  Meeting Time of the Ecclesia.--Four times in every prytany[*]
the Ecclesia must be convened for ordinary business, and oftener
if public occasion requires.  Five days' notice has to be given of
each regular meeting, and along with the notice a placard announcing
the proposals which are to come up has to be posted in the Agora.
But if there is a sudden crisis, formalities can be thrown to the
winds; a sudden bawling of the heralds in the streets, a great
smoky column caused by burning the traders' flimsy booths in the
Agora,--these are valid notices of an extraordinary meeting to
confront an immediate danger.

[*]"A prytany" was one tenth of a year, say 35 or 36 days, during
which time the 50 representatives of one of the ten Athenian tribes
then serving as members of the Council of 500 (each tribe taking
its turn) held the presidency of the Council and acted as a special
executive committee of the government.  There were thus at least
40 meetings of the Ecclesia each year, as well as the extraordinary
meetings.

If this has been a morning when the Ecclesia has been in session,
nothing unusual has occurred at first in the busy Agora, except
that the jury courts are hardly in action, and a bright flag is
whipping the air from the tall flagpole by the Pnyx (the Assembly
Place).  Then suddenly there is a shouting through the Agora.  The
clamor of traffic around the popular flower stalls ceases; everybody
who is not a slave or metic (and these would form a large fraction
of the crowd of marketers) begins to edge down toward one end of
the Agora.  Presently a gang of Scythian police-archers comes in
sight.  They have a long rope sprinkled with red chalk wherewith
they are "netting" the Agora.  The chalk will leave an infallible
mark on the mantle of every tardy citizen, and he who is thus marked
as late at the meeting will lose his fee for attendance, if not
subject himself to a fine.  So there is a general rush away from
the Agora and down one of the various avenues leading to the Pnyx.


132.  The Pnyx (Assembly Place) at Athens.--The Pnyx is an open
space of ground due west from the Acropolis.  It originally sloped
gently away towards the northeast, but a massive retaining wall
had been built around it, in an irregular semicircle, and the space
within filled with solidly packed earth sloping inwards, making a
kind of open air auditorium.  It is a huge place, 394 feet long,
and 213 feet at the widest.  The earthen slope is entirely devoid
of seats; everybody casts himself down sprawling or on his haunches,
perhaps with an old himation under him.  Directly before the sitters
runs a long ledge hewn out of the rock, forming, as it were, the
"stage" side of the theater.  Here the rock has been cut away, so
as to leave a sizable stone pulpit standing forth, with a small
flight of steps on each side.  This is the "Bema," the orator's
stand, whence speak the "demagogues,"[*] the molders of Athenian
public opinion.  In front of the Bema there is a small portable
altar for the indispensable sacrifices.  In the rear of the Bema
are a few planks laid upon the rock.  Here will sit the fifty
"Pryantes" in charge of the meeting.  There is a handsome chair
for the presiding officer upon the Bema itself.  These are all the
furnishings of the structure wherein Athens makes peace and war,
and orders her whole civil and foreign policy.  The Hellenic azure
is the only roof above her sovran law makers.  To the right, as
the orators stand on the Bema, they can point toward the Acropolis
and its glittering temples; to the left towards the Peir√¶us, and
the blue sea with the inevitable memories of glorious Salamis.
Surely it will be easy to fire all hearts with patriotism!

[*]A "demagogue" (=people-leader) might well be a great statesman,
and not necessarily a cheap and noisy politician.


133.  The Preliminaries of the Meeting.--Into this space the voters
swarm by hundreds--all the citizens of Athens, from twenty years
and upward, sufficiently interested to come.  At each crude entrance
stands a crops of watchful LEXIARCHS and their clerks, checking
off those present and turning back interlopers.  As the entering
crowds begin to thin, the entrance ways are presently closed by wicker
hurdles.  The flag fluttering on high is struck.  The Ecclesia is
ready for action.

Much earlier than this, the farmers and fishmen from the hill
towns or from Salamis have been in their places, grumbling at the
slowness of the officials.  People sit down where they can; little
groups and clans together, wedged in closely, chattering up to the
last minute, watching every proceeding with eyes as keen as cats'.
All the gossip left over from the Agora is disposed of ere the
prytanes--proverbially late--scramble into their seats of honor.
The police-archers move up and down, enforcing a kind of order.
Amid a growing hush a suckling pig is solemnly slaughtered by some
religious functionary at the altar, and the dead victim carried
around the circuit of the Pnyx as a symbolic purification of the
audience.

"Come inside the purified circuit," enjoins a loud herald to the
little groups upon the edge.[*]

[*]Aristophanes's "Acharnians" (ll. 50 ff.) gives a valuable
picture of this and other proceedings at the Pnyx, but one should
never forget the poet's exaggerations for comedy purposes, nor his
deliberate omission of matters likely to be mere tedious detail to
his audience.

Then comes a prayer invoking the gods' favor upon the Athenians,
their allies, and this present meeting in particular, winding up
(the herald counts this among the chief parts of his duty) with
a tremendous curse on any wretch who should deceive the folk with
evil counsel.  After this the real secular business can begin.
Nothing can be submitted to the Ecclesia which has not been previously
considered and matured by the Council of 500.  The question to be
proposed is now read by the heralds as a "Pro-bouleuma"--a suggested
ordinance by the Council.  Vast as is the audience, the acoustic
properties of the Pnyx are excellent, and all public officers and
orators are trained to harangue multitudes in the open air, so that
the thousands get every word of the proposition.


134.  Debating a Proposition.--"Resolved by the Boule, the tribe
Leontis holding the prytany, and Heraclides being clerk, upon the
motion of Timon the son of Timon the Eleusinian,[*] that"--and then
in formal language it is proposed to increase the garrison of the
allied city of Byzantium by 500 hired Arcadian mercenaries, since
the king of Thrace is threatening that city, and its continued
possession is absolutely essential to the free import of grain into
Attica.

[*]This seems to have been the regular form for beginning a
"probouleuma" although nearly all our information comes from the
texts of proposals AFTER they have been made formal decrees by the
sovran Demos.

There is a hush of expectancy; a craning of necks.

"Who wishes to speak?" calls the herald.

After a decent pause Timon, the mover of the measure, comes forward.
He is a fairly well-known character and commands a respectable
faction among the Demos.  There is some little clapping, mixed with
jeering, as he mounts the Bema.  The president of the prytanes--as
evidence that he has now the right to harangue--hands him a myrtle
wreath which he promptly claps on his head, and launches into his
argument.  Full speedily he has convinced at least a large share
of the audience that it was sheer destruction to leave Byzantium
without an efficient garrison.  Grain would soon be at famine
prices if the town were taken, etc., etc.  The only marvel is that
the merciful gods have averted the disaster so long in the face of
such neglect.--Why had the board of strategi, responsible in such
matters, neglected this obvious duty?  [Cheers intermixed with
catcalls.]  This was not the way the men who won Marathon had dealt
with dangers, nor later worthies like Nicias or Thrasybulus.  [More
cheers and catcalls.]  He winds up with a splendid invocation to
Earth, Sky, and Justice to bear witness that all this advice is
given solely with a view to the weal of Athens.

"He had Isocrates teach him how to launch that peroration," mutters
a crabbed old citizen behind his peak-trimmed beard, as Timon
descends amid mingled applause and derision.

"Very likely; Iphicrates is ready to answer him," replies a fellow.

"Who wishes to speak?" the herald demands again.  From a place
directly before the Bema a well-known figure, the elderly general,
Iphicrates, is rising.  At a nod from the president, he mounts the
Bema and assumes the myrtle.  He has not Timon's smooth tones nor
oratorical manner.  He is a man of action and war, and no tool of
the Agora coteries.  A salvo of applause greets him.  Very pithily
he observes that Byzantium will be safe enough if the city will only
be loyal to the Athenian alliance.  Athens needs all her garrisons
nearer home.  Timon surely knows the state of the treasury.  Is
he going to propose a special tax upon his fellow countrymen to
pay for those 500 mercenaries?  [Loud laughter and derisive howls
directed at Timon.]  Athens needs to keep her strength for REAL
dangers; and those are serious enough, but not at Byzantium.  At
the next meeting he and the other strategi will recommend--etc.,
etc.  When Iphicrates quits the Bema there is little left of Timon's
fine "Earth, Sky and Justice."


135.  Voting at the Pnyx.--But other orators follow on both sides.
Once Timon, egged on by many supporters, tries to gain the Bema
a second time, but is told by the president that one cannot speak
twice on the same subject.  Once the derision and shouting becomes
so violent that the president has to announce, "Unless there is
silence I must adjourn the meeting."  Finally, after an unsuccessful
effort to amend the proposal, by reducing the garrison at Byzantium
to 250, the movers of the measure realize that the votes will
probably be against them.  They try to break up the meeting.

"I hear thunder!"  "I feel rain!" they begin shouting, and such ill
omens, if really in evidence, would be enough to force an adjournment;
but the sky is delightfully clear.  The president simply shrugs
his shoulders; and now the Pnyx is fairly rocking with the yell,
"A vote!  A vote!"

The president rises.  Taking the vote in the Ecclesia is a very
simple matter when it is a plain question of "yes" or "no" on a
proposition.[*]

[*]When an INDIVIDUAL had to be voted for, then ballots were used.

"All who favor the 'probouleuma' of Timon will raise the right
hand!"

A respectable but very decided minority shows itself.

"Those who oppose."

The adverse majority is large.  The morning is quite spent.  There
is a great tumult.  Men are rising, putting on their himatia,
ridiculing Timon; while the herald at a nod from the president
declares the Ecclesia adjourned.


136.  The Ecclesia as an Educational Instrument.--Timon and his
friends retire crestfallen to discuss the fortunes of war.  They
are not utterly discouraged, however.  The Ecclesia is a fickle
creature.  What it withholds to-day it may grant to-morrow.
Iphicrates, whose words have carried such weight now, may soon be
howled down and driven from the Bema much as was the unfortunate
litigant in the jury court.  Still, with all its faults, the Ecclesia
is the great school for the adults of Athens.  All are on terms of
perfect equality.  King Demos is not the least respecter of wealth
or family.  Sophistries are usually penetrated in a twinkling
by some coarse expletive from a remote corner of the Pnyx.  Every
citizen understands the main issues of the public business.  HE IS
PART OF THE ACTUAL WORKING GOVERNMENT, not once per year (or less
often) at the ballot box, but at least forty times annually; and
dolt he would be, did he not learn at least all the superficialities
of statecraft.  He may make grievous errors.  He may be misled by
mob prejudice or mob enthusiasm; but he is not likely to persist
in a policy of crass blundering very long.  King Demos may indeed
rule a fallible human monarchy, but it is thanks to him, and to
his high court held at the Pnyx, that Athens owes at least half of
that sharpness of wit and intelligence which is her boast.





Chapter XVII.  The Afternoon at the Gymnasia.




137.  The Gymnasia.  Places of General Resort.--The market is thinning
after a busy day; the swarms of farmer-hucksters with their weary
asses are trudging homeward; the schoolrooms are emptying; the
dicasteries or the Ecclesia, as the case may be, have adjourned.
Even the slave artisans in the factories are allowed to slacken
work.  The sun, a ball of glowing fire, is slowly sinking to westward
over the slopes of √Ügaleos; the rock of the Acropolis is glowing
as if in flame; intense purple tints are creeping over all the
landscape.  The day is waning, and all Athenians who can possibly
find leisure are heading towards the suburbs for a walk, a talk,
and refreshment of soul and body at the several Gymnasia.

Besides various establishments and small "wrestling schools" for
the boys, there are three great public Gymnasia at Athens,--the
Lyceum to the east of the town; the Cynosarges[*] to the southward;
and last, but at all least, the Academy.  This is the handsomest,
the most famous, the most characteristic.  We shall do well to
visit it.

[*]The Cynosarges was the only one of these freely opened to such
Athenians as had non-Athenian mothers.  The other two were reserved
for the strictly "full citizens."


138.  The Road to the Academy.--We go out toward the northwest of
the city, plunging soon into a labyrinth of garden walls, fragrant
with the fruit and blossoms within, wander amid dark olive groves
where the solemn leaves of the sacred trees are talking sweetly;
and presently mount a knoll by some suburban farm buildings, then
look back to find that slight as is the elevation, here is a view
of marvelous beauty across the city, the Acropolis, and the guardian
mountains.  From the rustling ivy coverts come the melodious notes
of birds.  We are glad to learn that this is the suburb of Colonus,
the home of Sophocles the tragedian, and here is the very spot made
famous in the renowned chorus of his "≈ídipous at Colonus."  It is
too early, of course, to enjoy the nightingale which the poet asserts
sings often amid the branches, but the scene is one of marvelous
charm.  We are not come, however, to admire Colonus.  The numerous
strollers indicate our direction.  Turning a little to the south, we
see, embowered amid the olive groves which line the unseen stream
of the Cephissos, a wall, and once beyond it find ourselves in
a kind of spacious park combined with an athletic establishment.
This is the Academy,--founded by Hipparchus, son of Peisistratus
the tyrant, but given its real embellishments and beauty by Cimon,
the son of Militiades the victor of Marathon.


139.  The Academy.--The Academy is worthy of the visit.  The park
itself is covered with olive trees and more graceful plane trees.
The grass beneath us is soft and delightful to the bare foot (and
nearly everybody, we observe, has taken off his sandals).  There
are marble and bronze statues skillfully distributed amid the
shrubbery--shy nymphs, peeping fauns, bold satyrs.  Yonder is a
spouting fountain surmounted by a noble Poseidon with his trident;
above the next fountain rides the ocean car of Amphitrite.  Presently
we come to a series of low buildings.  Entering, we find them laid
out in a quadrangle with porticoes on every side, somewhat like the
promenades around the Agora.  Inside the promenades open a series
of ample rooms for the use of professional athletes during stormy
weather, and for the inevitable bathing and anointing with oil
which will follow all exercise.  This great square court formed by
the "gymnasium" proper is swarming with interesting humanity, but
we pass it hastily in order to depart by an exit on the inner side
and discover a second more conventionally laid out park.  Here to
right and to left are short stretches of soft sand divided into
convenient sections for wrestling, for quoit hurling, for javelin
casting, and for jumping; but a loud shout and cheering soon draw
us onward.  At the end of this park we find the stadium; a great
oval track, 600 feet (a "stadium") for the half circuit, with benches
and all the paraphernalia for a foot race.  The first contest have
just ended.  The races are standing, panting after their exertions,
but their friends are talking vehemently.  Out in the sand, near
the statue of Hermes (the patron god of gymnasia) is a dignified
and self-conscious looking man in a purple edged chiton--the
gymnasiarch, the official manager of the Academy.  While he waits
to organize a second race we can study the visitors and habitu√©s
of the gymnasium.


140.  The Social Atmosphere and Human Types at the Academy.--What
the Pnyx is to the political life of Athens, this the Academy and
the other great gymnasia are to its social and intellectual as
well as its physical life.  Here in daily intercourse, whether in
friendly contest of speed or brawn, or in the more valuable contest
of wits, the youth of Athens complete their education after escaping
from the rod of the schoolmaster.  Here they have daily lessons
on the mottoes, which (did such a thing exist) should be blazoned
on the coat of arms of Greece, as the summing up of all Hellenic
wisdom:--


"Know thyself,"


and again:--


"Be moderate."


Precept, example, and experience teach these truths at the gymnasia
of Athens.  Indeed, on days when the Ecclesia is not in session,
when no war is raging, and they are not busy with a lawsuit, many
Athenians will spend almost the whole day at the Academy.  For
whatever are your interests, here you are likely to find something
to engross you.

It must be confessed that not everybody at the Academy comes here
for physical or mental improvement.  We see a little group squatting
and gesticulating earnestly under an old olive tree--they are
obviously busy, not with philosophic theory, but with dice.  Again,
two young men pass us presenting a curious spectacle.  They are
handsomely dressed and over handsomely scented, but each carries
carefully under each arm a small cock; and from time to time they
are halted by fiends who admire the birds.  Clearly these worthies'
main interests are in cockfighting; and they are giving their
favorites "air and exercise" before the deadly battle, on which
there is much betting, a the supper party that night.  Also the
shouting and rumbling from a distance tells of the chariot course,
where the sons of the more wealthy or pretentious families are
lessening their patrimonies by training a "two" or a "four" to
contend at the Isthmian games or at Olympia.


141.  Philosophers and Cultivated Men at the Gymnasia.--All these
things are true, and Athens makes full display here of the usual
crop of knaves or fools.  Nevertheless this element is in the
minority.  Here a little earlier or a little later than our visit
(for just now he is in Sicily) one could see Plato himself--walking
under the shade trees and expounding to a little trailing host
of eager-eyed disciples the fundamental theories of his ideal
Commonwealth.  Here are scores of serious bearded faces, and heads
sprinkled with gray, moving to and fro in small groups, discussing
in melodious Attic the philosophy, the poetry, the oration, which
has been partly considered in the Agora this morning, and which
will be further discussed at the symposium to-night.  Everything
is entirely informal.  Even white-haired gentlemen do not hesitate
to cast off chiton and himation and spring around nimbly upon the
sands, to "try their distance" with the quoits, or show the young
men that they have not forgotten accuracy with the javelin, or
even, against men of their own age, to test their sinews in a mild
wrestling bout.  It is undignified for an old man to attempt feats
beyond his advanced years.  No one expects any great proficiency
from most of those present.  It is enough to attempt gracefully,
and to laugh merrily if you do not succeed.  Everywhere there is
the greatest good nature, and even frolicking, but very little of
the really boisterous.


142.  The Beautiful Youths at the Academy.--Yet the majority of
the visitors to the Academy have an interest that is not entirely
summed up in proper athletics, or in the baser sports, or in
philosophy.  Every now and then a little whisper runs among the
groups of strollers or athlete  "There he goes!--a new one!  How
beautiful!"--and there is a general turning of heads.

A youth goes by, his body quite stripped, and delicately bronzed by
constant exposure to the sun.  His limbs are graceful, but vigorous
and straight, his chest is magnificently curved.  He lifts his head
modestly, yet with a proud and easy carriage.  His hair is dark
blonde; his profile very "Greek"--nose and forehead joining in
unbroken straight line.  A little crowd is following him; a more
favored comrade, a stalwart, bearded man, walks at his side.  No
need of questioning now whence the sculptors of Athens get their
inspiration.  This happy youth, just out of the schoolroom, and
now to be enrolled as an armed ephebus, will be the model soon for
some immortal bronze or marble.  Fortunate is he, if his humility
is not ruined by all the admiration and flattery; if he can remember
the injunctions touching "modesty," which master and father have
repeated so long; if he can remember the precept that true beauty
of body can go only with true beauty of soul.  Now at least is his
day of hidden or conscious pride.  All Athens is commending him.
He is the reigning toast, like the "belle" of a later age.  Not the
groundlings only, but the poets, rhetoricians, philosophers, will
gaze after him, seek an introduction, compliment him delicately,
give themselves the pleasure of making him blush deliciously,
and go back to their august problems unconsciously stimulated and
refreshed by this vision of "the godlike."[*]

[*]For pertinent commentary on the effect of meeting a beautiful
youth upon very grave men, see, e.g., Plato's "Charmides" (esp.
158 a) and "Lysis" (esp. 206 d).  Or better still in Xenophon's
"Symposium" (I.9), where we hear of the beautiful youth Autolycus,
"even as a bright light at night draws every eye, so by HIS beauty
drew on him the gaze of all the company [at the banquet].  Not a
man was present who did not feel his emotions stirred by the sight
of him."


143.  The Greek Worship of Manly Beauty.--The Greek worship of the
beautiful masculine form is something which the later world will
never understand.  In this worship there is too often a coarseness,
a sensual dross, over which a veil is wisely cast.  but the great
fact of this worship remains:  to the vast majority of Greeks
"beauty" does not imply a delicate maid clad in snowy drapery; it
implies a perfectly shaped, bronzed, and developed youth, standing
forth in his undraped manhood for some hard athletic battle.  The
ideal possess the national life, and effects the entire Greek
civilization.  Not beauty in innocent weakness, but beauty in
resourceful strength--before this beauty men bow down.[*]

[*]Plato ("Republic," p. 402) gives the view of enlightened Greek
opinion when he states "There can be no fairer spectacle than that
of a man who combines the possession of MORAL beauty in his soul,
with OUTWARD beauty of body, corresponding and harmonizing with
the former, because the same great pattern enters into both."

It is this masculine type of beauty, whether summed up in a physical
form or translated by imagery into the realm of the spirit, that
Isocrates (a very good mouthpieces for average enlightened opinion)
praises in language which strains even his facile rhetoric.  "[Beauty]
is the first of all things in majesty, honor, and divineness.  Nothing
devoid of beauty is prized; the admiration of virtue itself comes
to this, that of all manifestations of life, virtue is the most
beautiful.  The supremacy of beauty over all things can be seen in
our own disposition toward it, and toward them.  Other things we
merely seek to attain as we need them, but beautiful things inspire us
with love, LOVE which is as much stronger than WISH as its object
is better.  To the beautiful alone, as to the gods, we are never
tired of doing homage; delighting to be their slaves rather than
to be the rulers of others."

Could we put to all the heterogeneous crowd in the wide gymnasium
the question, "What things do you desire most?" the answer "To
be physically beautiful" (not "handsome" merely, but "beautiful")
would come among the first wishes.  There is a little song, very
popular and very Greek.  It tells most of the story.


The best of gifts to mortal man is health;
   The next the bloom of beauty's matchless flower;
The third is blameless and unfraudful wealth;
   The fourth with friends to spend youths' joyous hour.[*]

[*]Translation by Milman.  The exact date of this Greek poem is
uncertain, but its spirit is entirely true to that of Athens in
the time of this sketch.


Health and physical beauty thus go before wealth and the passions
of friendship,--a true Greek estimate!


144.  The Detestation of Old Age.--Again, we are quick to learn
that this "beauty" is the beauty of youth.  It is useless to talk
to an Athenian of a "beautiful old age."  Old age is an evil to
be borne with dignity, with resignation if needs be, to be fought
against by every kind of bodily exercise; but to take satisfaction
in it?--impossible.  It means a diminishing of those keen powers
of physical and intellectual enjoyment which are so much to every
normal Athenian.  It means becoming feeble, and worse than feeble,
ridiculous.  The physician's art has not advanced so far as to
prevent the frequent loss of sight and hearing in even moderate age.
No hope of a future renewal of noble youth in a happier world gilds
the just man's sunset.  Old age must, like the untimely passing
of loved ones, be endured in becoming silence, as one of the fixed
inevitables; but it is gloomy work to pretend to find it cheerful.
Only the young can find life truly happy.  Euripides in "The Mad
Heracles" speaks for all his race:--


Tell me not of the Asian tyrant,
  Or of palaces plenished with gold;
For such bliss I am not an aspirant,
  If YOUTH I might only behold:--
Youth that maketh prosperity higher,
And ever adversity lighter.[*]

[*]Mahaffy, translator.  Another very characteristic lament for
the passing of youth is left us by the early elegiac poet Mimnermus.


145.  The Greeks unite Moral and Physical Beauty.--But here at the
Academy, this spirit of beautiful youth, and the "joy of life,"
is everywhere dominant.  All around us are the beautiful bodies
of young men engaged in every kind of graceful exercise.  When
we question, we are told that current belief is that in a great
majority of instances there is a development and a symmetry of
mind corresponding to the glory of the body.  It is contrary to all
the prevalent notions of the reign of "divine harmony" to have it
otherwise.  The gods abhor all gross contradictions!  Even now men
will argue over a strange breach of this rule;--why did heaven
suffer Socrates to have so beautiful a soul set in so ugly a
body?--Inscrutable are the ways of Zeus!

However, we have generalized and wandered enough.  The Academy is
a place of superabounding activities.  Let us try to comprehend
some of them.


146.  The Usual Gymnastic Sports and their Objects.--Despite all
the training in polite conversation which young men are supposed
to receive at the gymnasium, the object of the latter is after all
to form places of athletic exercise.  The Athenians are without
most of these elaborate field games such as later ages will call
"baseball" and "football"; although, once learned, they could
surely excel in these prodigiously.  They have a simple "catch"
with balls, but it hardly rises above the level of a children's
pastime.  The reasons for these omissions are probably, first,
because so much time is devoted to the "pal√¶stra" exercises;
secondly, because military training eats up about all the time not
needed for pure gymnastics.

The "pal√¶stra" exercises, taught first at the boys' training
establishments and later continued at the great gymnasia, are nearly
all of the nature of latter-day "field sports."  They do not depend
on the costly apparatus of the twentieth century athletic halls;
and they accomplish their ends with extremely simple means.  The
aim of the instructor is really twofold--to give his pupils a body
fit and apt for war (and we have seen that to be a citizen usually
implies being a hoplite), and to develop a body beautiful to the
eye and efficient for civil life.  The naturally beautiful youth
can be made more beautiful; the naturally homely youth can be made
at least passable under the care of a skilful gymnastic teacher.


147.  Professional Athletes:  the Pancration.--Athletics, then, are
a means to an end and should not be tainted with professionalism.
True, as we wander about the Academy we see heavy and over brawny
individuals whose "beauty" consists in flattened noses, mutilated
ears, and mouths lacking many teeth, and who are taking their way
to the remote quarter where boxing is permitted.  Here they will
wind hard bull's hide thongs around their hands and wrists, and
pummel one another brutally, often indeed (if in a set contest)
to the very risk of life.  These men are obviously professional
athletes who, after appearing with some success at the "Nemea," are
in training for the impending "Pythia" at Delphi.  A large crowd
of youths of the less select kind follows and cheers them; but
the better public opinion frowns on them.  They are denounced by
the philosophers.  Their lives no less than their bodies "are not
beautiful"--i.e. they offend against the spirit of harmony inherent
in every Greek.  Still less are they in genteel favor when, the
preliminary boxing round being finished, they put off their boxing
thongs and join in the fierce "Pancration," a not unskillful
combination of boxing with wrestling, in which it is not suffered
to strike with the knotted fist, but in which, nevertheless,
a terrible blow can be given with the bent fingers.  Kicking,
hitting, catching, tripping, they strive together mid the "Euge!
Euge!--Bravo! Bravo!" of their admirers until one is beaten down
hopelessly upon the sand, and the contest ends without harm.  Had
it been a real Pancration, however, it would have been desperate
business, for it is quite permissible to twist an opponent's wrist,
and even to break his fingers, to make him give up the contest.
Therefore it is not surprising that the Pancration, even more than
boxing, is usually reserved for professional athletes.


148.  Leaping Contests.--But near at hand is a more pleasing
contest.  Youths of the ephebus age are practicing leaping.  They
have no springboard, no leaping pole, but only a pair of curved
metal dumb-bells to aid them.  One after another their lithe brown
bodies, shining with the fresh olive oil, come forward on a lightning
run up the little mound of earth, then fly gracefully out across
the soft sands.  There is much shouting and good-natured rivalry.
As each lad leaps, an eager attendant marks his distance with a
line drawn by the pickaxe.  The lines gradually extend ever farther
from the mound.  The rivalry is keen.  Finally, there is one leap
that far exceeds the rest.[*]  A merry crowd swarms around the
blushing victor.  A grave middle-aged man takes the ivy crown from
his head, and puts it upon the happy youth.  "Your father will take
joy in you," he says as the knot breaks up.

[*]If the data of the ancients are to be believed, the Greeks achieved
records in leaping far beyond those of any modern athletes, but it
is impossible to rely on data of this kind.


149.  Quoit Hurling.--Close by the leapers is another stretch of
yellow sand reserved for the quoit throwers.  The contestants here
are slightly older,--stalwart young men who seem, as they fling the
heavy bronze discus, to be reaching out eagerly into the fullness
of life and fortune before them.  Very graceful are the attitudes.
Here it was the sculptor Miron saw his "Discobolus" which he
immortalized and gave to all the later world; "stooping down to
take aim, his body turned in the direction of the hand which holds
the quoit, one knee slightly bent as though he meant to vary the
posture and to rise with the throw."[*]  The caster, however, does
not make his attempt standing.  He takes a short run, and then the
whole of his splendid body seems to spring together with the cast.

[*]The quotation is from Lucian (Roman Imperial period).


150.  Casting the javelin.--The range of the quoit hurlers in turn
seems very great, but we cannot delay to await the issue.  Still
elsewhere in the Academy they are hurling the javelin.  Here is a
real martial exercise, and patriotism as well as natural athletic
spirit urges young men to excel.  the long light lances are being
whirled at a distant target with remarkable accuracy; and well they
may, for every contestant has the vision of some hour when he may
stand on the poop of a trireme and hear the dread call, "All hands
repel boarders," or need all his darts to break up the rush of a
pursuing band of hoplites.


151.  Wrestling.--The real crowds, however, are around the wrestlers
and the racers.  Wrestling in its less brutal form is in great
favor.  It brings into play all the muscles of a man; it tests
his resources both of mind and body finely.  It is excellent for
a youth and it fights away old age.  The Greek language is full of
words and allusions taken from the wrestler's art.  The pal√¶stras
for the boys are called "the wrestling school" par excellence.
It is no wonder that now the ring on the sands is a dense one and
constantly growing.  Two skilful amateurs will wrestle.  One--a
speedy rumor tells us--is, earlier and later in the day, a rising
comic poet; the other is not infrequently heard on the Bema.  Just
at present, however, they have forgotten anapests and oratory.  A
crowd of cheering, jesting friends thrusts them on.  Forth they
stand, two handsome, powerful men, well oiled for suppleness, but
also sprinkled with fine sand to make it possible to get a fair
grip in the contest.

For a moment they wag their sharp black beards at each other
defiantly, and poise and edge around.  Then the poet, more daring,
rushes in, and instantly the two have grappled--each clutching the
other's left wrist in his right hand.  The struggle that follows
is hot and even, until a lucky thrust from the orator's foot lands
the poet in a sprawling heap; whence he rises with a ferocious grin
and renews the contest.  The second time they both fall together.
"A tie!" calls the long-gowned friend who acts as umpire, with an
officious flourish of his cane.

The third time the poet catches the orator trickily under the thigh,
and fairly tears him to the ground; but at the fourth meeting the
orator slips his arm in decisive grip about his opponent's wrist
and with a might wrench upsets him.

"Two casts out of three, and victory!"

Everybody laughs good-naturedly.  The poet and the orator go away
arm in arm to the bathing house, there to have another good oiling
and rubbing down by their slaves, after removing the heavily caked
sand from their skin with the stirgils.  Of course, had it been a
real contest in the "greater games," the outcome might have been
more serious for the rules allow one to twist a wrist, to thrust an
arm or foot into the foeman's belly, or (when things are desperate)
to dash your forehead--bull fashion--against your opponent's brow,
in the hope that his skull will prove weaker than yours.


152.  Foot Races.--The continued noise from the stadium indicates
that the races are still running; and we find time to go thither.
The simple running match, a straight-away dash of 600 feet, seems
to have been the original contest at the Olympic games ere these
were developed into a famous and complicated festival; and the
runner still is counted among the favorites of Greek athletics.
As we sit upon the convenient benches around the academy stadium
we see at once that the track is far from being a hard, well-rolled
"cinder path"; on the contrary, it is of soft sand into which the
naked foot sinks if planted too firmly, and upon it the most adept
"hard-track" runner would at first pant and flounder helplessly.
The Greeks have several kinds of foot races, but none that are very
short.  The shortest is the simple "stadium" (600 feet), a straight
hard dash down one side of the long oval; then there is the "double
course" ("diaulos") down one side and back; the "horse race"--twice
clear around (2400 feet); and lastly the hard-testing "long course"
("dolichos") which may very in length according to arrangement,--seven,
twelve, twenty, or even twenty-four stadia, we are told; and it
is the last (about three miles) that is one of the most difficult
contests at Olympia.

At this moment a part of four hale and hearty men still in the
young prime are about to compete in the "double race."  They come
forward all rubbed with the glistening oil, and crouch at the
starting point behind the red cord held by two attendants.  The
gymnasiarch stands watchfully by, swinging his cane to smite painfully
whoever, in over eagerness, breaks away before the signal.  All
is ready; at his nod the rope falls.  The four fly away together,
pressing their elbows close to their sides, and going over the soft
sands with long rhythmic leaps, rather than with the usual rapid
running motion.  A fierce race it is, amid much exhortation from
friends and shouting.  At length, as so often--when speeding back
towards the stretched cord,--the rearmost runner suddenly gathers
amazing speed, and, flying with prodigious leaps ahead of his
rivals, is easily the victor.  His friends are at once about him,
and we hear the busy tongues advising, "You must surely race at
the Pythia; the Olympia; etc."

This simple race over, a second quickly follows:  five heavy, powerful
men this time, but they are to run in full hoplite's armor--the
ponderous shield, helmet, cuirass, and greaves.  This is the exacting
"Armor Race" ("Hoplitodromos"), and safe only for experienced
soldiers or professional athletes.[*]  Indeed, the Greeks take all
their foot races seriously, and there are plenty of instances when
the victor has sped up to the goal, and then dropped dead before
the applauding stadium.  There are no stop watches in the Academy;
we do not know the records of the present or of more famous runners;
yet one may be certain that the "time" made, considering the very
soft sand, has been exceedingly fast.

[*]It was training in races like these which enabled the Athenians at
Marathon to "charge the Persians on the run" (Miltiades' orders),
all armored though they were, and so get quickly through the terrible
zone of the Persian arrow fire.


153.  The Pentathlon:  the Honors paid to Great Athletes.--We have
now seen average specimens of all the usual athletic sports of the
Greeks.  Any good authority will tell us, however, that a truly
capable athlete will not try to specialize so much in any one kind
of contest that he cannot do justice to the others.  As an all
around well-trained man he will try to excel in the "Pentathlon,"
the "five contests."  Herein he will successfully join in running,
javelin casting, quoit throwing, leaping, and wrestling.[*]  As
the contest proceeds the weaker athletes will be eliminated; only
the two fittest will be left for the final trial of strength and
skill.  Fortunate indeed is "he who overcometh" in the Pentathlon.
It is the crown of athletic victories, involving, as it does, no
scanty prowess both of body and mind.  The victor in the Pentathlon
at one of the great Pan-Hellenic games (Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian,
or Nemean) or even in the local Attic contest at the Panathen√¶a is
a marked man around Athens or any other Greek city.  Poets celebrate
him; youths dog his heels and try to imitate him; his kinsfolk take
on airs; very likely he is rewarded as a public benefactor by the
government.  But there is abundant honor for one who has triumphed
in ANY of the great contests; and even as we go out we see people
pointing to a bent old man and saying, "Yes; he won the quoit
hurling at the Nema when Ithycles was archon."[+]

[*]The exact order of these contests, and the rules of elimination
as the games proceeded, are uncertain--perhaps they varied with
time and place.

[+]This would make it 398 B.C.  The Athenians dated their years by
the name of their "first Archon" ("Archon eponymos").

...The Academy is already thinning.  The beautiful youths and their
admiring "lovers" have gone homeward.  The last race has been run.
We must hasten if we would not be late to some select symposium.
The birds are more melodious than ever around Colonus; the red and
golden glow upon the Acropolis is beginning to fade; the night is
sowing the stars; and through the light air of a glorious evening
we speed back to the city.





Chapter XVIII.  Athenian Cookery and the Symposium.




154.  Greek Meal Times.--The streets are becoming empty.  The
Agora has been deserted for hours.  As the warm balmy night closes
over the city the house doors are shut fast, to open only for the
returning master or his guests, bidden to dinner.  Soon the ways
will be almost silent, to be disturbed, after a proper interval, by
the dinner guests returning homeward.  Save for these, the streets
will seem those of a city of the dead:  patrolled at rare intervals
by the Scythian archers, and also ranged now and then by cutpurses
watching for an unwary stroller, or miscreant roisterers trolling
lewd songs, and pounding on honest men's doors as they wander from
tavern to tavern in search of the lowest possible pleasures.

We have said very little of eating or drinking during our visit in
Athens, for, truth to tell, the citizens try to get through the day
with about as little interruption for food and drink as possible.
But now, when warehouse and gymnasium alike are left to darkness,
all Athens will break its day of comparative fasting.

Roughly speaking, the Greeks anticipate the latter-day "Continental"
habits in their meal hours.  The custom of Germans and of many
Americans in having the heartiest meal at noonday would never appeal
to them.  The hearty meal is at night, and no one dreams of doing
any serious work after it.  When it is finished, there may be
pleasant discourse or varied amusements, but never real business;
and even if there are guests, the average dinner party breaks up
early.  Early to bed and early to rise, would be a maxim indorsed
by the Athenians.

Promptly upon rising, our good citizen has devoured a few morsels
of bread sopped in undiluted wine; that has been to him what "coffee
and rolls" will be to the Frenchmen,--enough to carry him through
the morning business, until near to noon he will demand something
more satisfying.  He then visits home long enough to partake of a
substantial d√©jeuner ("ariston," first breakfast = "akratisma").
He has one or two hot dishes--one may suspect usually warmed over
from last night's dinner--and partakes of some more wine.  This
"ariston" will be about all he will require until the chief meal of
the day--the regular dinner ("de√Øpnon") which would follow sunset.


155.  Society desired at Meals.--The Athenians are a gregarious
sociable folk.  Often enough the citizen must dine alone at home
with "only" his wife and children for company, but if possible he
will invite friends (or get himself invited out).  Any sort of an
occasion is enough to excuse a dinner-party,--a birthday of some
friend, some kind of family happiness, a victory in the games, the
return from, or the departure upon, a journey:--all these will answer;
or indeed a mere love of good fellowship.  There are innumerable
little eating clubs; the members go by rotation to their respective
houses.  Each member contributes either some money or has his slave
bring a hamper of provisions.  In the find weather picnic parties
down upon the shore are common.[*]  "Anything to bring friends
together"--in the morning the Agora, in the afternoon the gymnasium,
in the evening they symposium--that seems to be the rule of Athenian
life.

[*]Such excursions were so usual that the literal expression "Let
us banquet at the shore" ([Note from Brett:  The Greek letters
are written out here as there is no way to portray them properly]
sigma eta mu epsilon rho omicron nu [next word] alpha kappa tau
alpha sigma omega mu epsilon nu [here is a rough transliteration
into English letters "s√™meron aktas√¥men"]) came often to mean simply
"Let us have a good time."

However, the Athenians seldom gather to eat for the mere sake
of animal gorging.  They have progressed since the Greeks of the
Homeric Age.  Odysseus[*] is made to say to Alcino√ºs that there is
nothing more delightful than sitting at a table covered with bread,
meat, and wine, and listening to a bard's song; and both Homeric
poems show plenty of gross devouring and guzzling.  There is not
much of this in Athens, although B≈ìotians are still reproached with
being voracious, swinish "flesh eaters," and the Greeks of South
Italy and Sicily are considered as devoted to their fare, though
of more refined table habits.  Athenians of the better class pride
themselves on their light diet and moderation of appetite, and
their neighbors make considerable fun of them for their failure to
serve satisfying meals.  Certain it is that the typical Athenian
would regard a twentieth century "table d'h√¥te" course dinner as
heavy and unrefined, if ever it dragged its slow length before him.

[*]"Odyssey," IX. 5-10.


156.  The Staple Articles of Food.--However, the Athenians have
honest appetites, and due means of silencing them.  The diet of a
poor man is indeed simple in the extreme.  According to Aristophanes
his meal consists of a cake, bristling with bran for the sake
of economy, along with an onion and a dish of sow thistles, or of
mushrooms, or some other such wretched vegetables; and probably, in
fact, that is about all three fourths of the population of Attica
will get on ordinary working days, always with the addition of a
certain indispensable supply of oil and wine.

Bread, oil, and wine, in short, are the three fundamentals of Greek
diet.  With them alone man can live very healthfully and happily;
without them elaborate vegetable and meat dishes are poor
substitutes.  Like latter-day Frenchmen or Italians with their huge
loaves or macaroni, BREAD in one form or another is literally the
stuff of life to the Greek.  He makes it of wheat, barley, rye,
millet, or spelt, but preferably of the two named first.  The barley
meal is kneaded (not baked) and eaten raw or half raw as a sort of
porridge.  Of wheat loaves there are innumerable shapes on sale in
the Agora,--slender rolls, convenient loaves, and also huge loaves
needing two or three bushels of flour, exceeding even those made
in a later day in Normandy.  At every meal the amount of bread or
porridge consumed is enormous; there is really little else at all
substantial.  Persian visitors to the Greeks complain that they
are in danger of rising from the table hungry.

But along with the inevitable bread goes the inevitable OLIVE OIL.
No latter-day article will exactly correspond to it.  First of all
it takes the place of butter as the proper condiment to prevent
the bread from being tasteless.[*]  It enters into every dish.
The most versatile cook will be lost without it.  Again, at the
gymnasium we have seen its great importance to the athletes and
bathers.  It is therefore the Hellenic substitute for soap.  Lastly,
it fills the lamps which swing over very dining board.  It takes
the place of electricity, gas, or petroleum.  No wonder Athens
is proud of her olive trees.  If she has to import her grain, she
has a surplus for export of one of the three great essentials of
Grecian life.

[*]There was extremely little cow's butter in Greece.  Herodotus (iv.
2) found it necessary to explain the process of "cow-cheese-making"
among the Scythians.

The third inevitable article of diet is WINE.  No one has dreamed
of questioning its vast desirability under almost all circumstances.
Even drunkenness is not always improper.  It may be highly fitting,
as putting one in a "divine frenzy," partaking of the nature of
the gods.  Mus√¶us the semi-mythical poet is made out to teach that
the reward of virtue will be something like perpetual intoxication
in the next world.  √Üschines the orator will, ere long, taunt his
opponent Demosthenes in public with being a "water drinker"; and
Socrates on many occasions has given proof that he possessed a
very hard head.  Yet naturally the Athenian has too acute a sense
of things fit and dignified, too noble a perception of the natural
harmony, to commend drunkenness on any but rare occasions.  Wine
is rather valued as imparting a happy moderate glow, making the
thoughts come faster, and the tongue more witty.  Wine raises the
spirits of youth, and makes old age forget its gray hairs.  It
chases away thoughts of the dread hereafter, when one will lose
consciousness of the beautiful sun, and perhaps wander a "strengthless
shade" through the dreary underworld.

There is a song attributed to Anacreon, and nearly everybody in
Athens approves the sentiment:--


Thirsty earth drinks up the rain,
Trees from earth drink that again;
Ocean drinks the air, the sun
Drinks the sea, and him, the moon.
Any reason, canst thou think,
I should thirst, while all these drink?[*]

[*]Translation from Von Falke's "Greece and Rome."


157.  Greek Vintages.--All Greeks, however, drink their wine so
diluted with water that it takes a decided quantity to produce a
"reaction."  The average drinker takes three parts water to two of
wine.  If he is a little reckless the ratio is four of water to
three of wine; equal parts "make men mad" as the poet says, and are
probably reserved for very wild dinner parties.  As for drinking
pure wine no one dreams of the thing--it is a practice fit for
Barbarians.  There is good reason, however, for this plentiful
use of water.  In the original state Greek wines were very strong,
perhaps almost as alcoholic as whisky, and the Athenians have no
Scotch climate to excuse the use of such stimulants.[*]

[*]There was a wide difference of opinion as to the proper amount
of dilution.  Odysseus ("Odyssey," IX. 209) mixed his fabulously
strong wine from Maron in Thrace with twenty times its bulk of
water.  Hesiod abstemiously commended three parts of water to one
of wine.  Zaleucus, the lawgiver of Italian Locri, established the
death penalty for drinking unmixed wine save by physicians' orders
("Athen√¶us," X. 33).

No wine served in Athens, however, will appeal to a later-day
connoisseur.  It is all mixed with resin, which perhaps makes it
more wholesome, but to enjoy it then becomes an acquired taste.
There are any number of choice vintages, and you will be told that
the local Attic wine is not very desirable, although of course it
is the cheapest.  Black wine is the strongest and sweetest; white
wine is the weakest; rich golden is the driest and most wholesome.
The rocky isles and headlands of the √Ügean seem to produce the
best vintage--Thasos, Cos, Lesbos, Rhodes, all boast their grapes;
but the best wine beyond a doubt is from Chios.[*]  It will fetch
a mina ($18 [1914 or $310.14 2000]) the "metreta," i.e. nearly 50
cents [1914 or $8.62 2000] per quart.  At the same time you can
buy a "metreta" of common Attic wine for four drachmae (72 cents
[1914 or $12.41 2000]), or say two cents [1914 or 34 cents 2000]
per quart.  The latter--when one considers the dilution--is surely
cheap enough for the most humble.

[*]Naturally certain foreign vintages had a demand, just because
they were foreign.  Wine was imported from Egypt and from various
parts of Italy.  It was sometimes mixed with sea water for export,
or was made aromatic with various herbs and berries.  It was
ordinarily preserved in great earthen jars sealed with pitch.


158.  Vegetable Dishes.--Provided with bread, oil, and wine, no
Athenian will long go hungry; but naturally these are not a whole
feast.  As season and purse may afford they will be supplanted by
such vegetables as beans (a staple article), peas, garlic, onions,
radishes, turnips, and asparagus; also with an abundance of
fruits,--besides figs (almost a fourth indispensable at most meals),
apples, quinces, peaches, pears, plums, cherries, blackberries,
the various familiar nuts, and of course a plenty of grapes and
olives.  The range of selection is in fact decidedly wide:  only
the twentieth century visitor will miss the potato, the lemon, and
the orange; and when he pries into the mysteries of the kitchen a
great fact at once stares him in the face.  The Greek must dress
his dishes without the aid of sugar.  As a substitute there is an
abundant use of the delicious Hymettus honey,--"fragrant with the
bees,"--but it is by no means so full of possibilities as the white
powder of later days.  Also the Greek cook is usually without fresh
cow's milk, and most goat's milk probably takes its way to cheese.
No morning milk carts rattle over the stones of Athens.


159.  Meat and Fish Dishes.--Turning to the meat dishes, we at once
learn that while there is a fair amount of farm poultry, geese,
hares, doves, partridges, etc., on sale in the market, there is
extremely little fresh beef or even mutton, pork, and goat's flesh.
It is quite expensive, and counted too hearty for refined diners.
The average poor man in fact hardly tastes flesh except after one
of the great public festivals; then after the sacrifice of the
"hecatomb" of oxen, there will probably be a distribution of roast
meat to all the worshipers, and the honest citizen will take home
to his wife an uncommon luxury--a piece of roast beef.  But the
place of beef and pork is largely usurped by most excellent fish.
The waters of the √Ügean abound with fish.  The import of salt fish
(for the use of the poor) from the Propontis and Euxine is a great
part of Attic commerce.  A large part of the business at the Agora
centers around the fresh fish stalls, and we have seen how extortionate
and insolent were the fishmongers.  Sole, tunny, mackerel, young
shark, mullet, turbot, carp, halibut, are to be had, but the choicest
regular delicacies are the great Copaic eels from B≈ìotia; these,
"roasted on the coals and wrapped in beet leaves," are a dish
fit for the Great King.  Lucky is the host who has them for his
dinner party.  Oysters and mussels too are in demand, and there is
a considerable sale of snails, "the poor man's salad," even as in
present-day France.

Clearly, then, if one is not captious or gluttonous, there should
be no lack of good eating in Athens, despite the reputation of the
city for abstemiousness.  Let us pry therefore into the symposium
of some good citizen who is dispensing hospitality to-night.


160.  Inviting Guests to a Dinner Party.--


Who loves thee, him summon to they board;
Far off be he who hates.


This familiar sentiment of Hesiod, one Prodicus, a well-to-do
gentleman, had in mind when he went to the Agora this morning to
arrange for a dinner party in honor of his friend Hermogenes, who
was just departing on a diplomatic mission to the satrap of Mysia.
While walking along the Painted Porch and the other colonnades he
had no difficulty in seeing most of the group he intended to invite,
and if they did not turn to greet him, he would halt them by sending
his slave boy to run and twitch at their mantles, after which the
invitation was given verbally.  Prodicus, however, deliberately
makes arrangements for one or two more than those he has bidden.
It will be entirely proper for his guests to bring friends of their
own if they wish; and very likely some intimate whom he has been
unable to find will invite himself without any bidding.

At the Agora Prodicus has had much to do.  His house is a fairly
large and well-furnished one, his slaves numerous and handy, but he
has not the cook or the equipment for a really elaborate symposium.
At a certain quarter on the great square he finds a contractor
who will supply all the extra appointments for a handsome dinner
party--tables, extra lamps, etc.  Then he puts his slave boy to
bawling out:


"Who wants an engagement to cook a dinner?"


This promptly brings forward a sleek, well-dressed fellow whose
dialect declares that he is from Sicily, and who asserts he is an
expert professional cook.  Prodicus engages him and has a conference
with him on the profound question of "whether the tunnies or the
mullets are better to-day, or will there be fresh eels?"  This
point and similar minor matters settled, Prodicus makes liberal
purchases at the fish and vegetable stalls, and his slaves bear
his trophies homeward.


161.  Preparing for the Dinner.  The Sicilian Cook.--All that
afternoon the home of Prodicus is in an uproar.  The score of
slaves show a frantic energy.  The aula is cleaned and scrubbed:
the serving girls are busy handing festoons of leaves and weaving
chaplets.  The master's wife--who does not dream of actually sharing
in the banquet--is nevertheless as active and helpful as possible;
but especially she is busy trying to keep the peace between the old
house servants and the imported cook.  This Sicilian is a notable
character.  To him cookery is not a handicraft:  it is the triumph,
the quintessence of all science and philosophy.  He talks a strange
professional jargon, and asserts that he is himself learned in
astronomy--for that teaches the best seasons, e.g. for mackerel and
haddock; in geometry,--that he might know how a boiler or gridiron
should be set to the best advantage; in medicine, that he might
prepare the most wholesome dishes.  In any case he is a perfect
tyrant around the kitchen, grumbling about the utensils, cuffing
the spit-boy, and ever bidding him bring more charcoal for the fire
and to blow the bellows faster.[*]

[*]The Greeks seem to have cooked over a rather simple open fireplace
with a wood or charcoal fire.  They had an array of cooking utensils,
however, according to all our evidence, elaborate enough to gladden
a very exacting modern CHEF.

By the time evening is at hand Prodicus and his house are in
perfect readiness.  The bustle is ended; and the master stands by
the entrance way, clad in his best and with a fresh myrtle wreath,
ready to greet his guests.  No ladies will be among these.  Had
there been any women invited to the banquet, they would surely
be creatures of no very honest sort; and hardly fit, under any
circumstances, to darken the door of a respectable citizen.  The
mistress and her maids are "behind the scenes."  There may be a woman
among the hired entertainers provided, but for a refined Athenian
lady to appear at an ordinary symposium is almost unthinkable.[*]

[*]In marriage parties and other strictly family affairs women were
allowed to take part; and we have an amusing fragment of Menander
as to how, on such rare occasions, they monopolized the conversation.


162.  The Coming of the Guests.--As each guest comes, he is seen
to be elegantly dressed, and to wear now, if at no other time, a
handsome pair of sandals.[*]  He has also taken pains to bathe and
to perfume himself.  As soon as each person arrives his sandals
are removed in the vestibule by the slaves and his feet are bathed.
No guest comes alone, however: every one has his own body servant
with him, who will look after his footgear and himation during
the dinner, and give a certain help with the serving.  The house
therefore becomes full of people, and will be the scene of remarkable
animation during the next few hours.

[*]Socrates, by way of exception to his custom, put on some fine
sandals when he was invited to a banquet.

Prodicus is not disappointed in expecting some extra visitors.  His
guest of honor, Hermogenes, has brought along two, whom the host
greets with the polite lie:  "Just in time for dinner.  Put off
your other business.  I was looking for you in the Agora and could
not find you."[*]  Also there thrusts in a half genteel, half
rascally fellow, one Palladas, who spends all his evenings at
dinner parties, being willing to be the common butt and jest of the
company (having indeed something of the ability of a comic actor
about him) in return for a share of the good things on the table.
These "Parasites" are regular characters in Athens, and no symposium
is really complete without them, although often their fooleries
cease to be amusing.[+]

[*]It is with such a white fib that the host Agathon salutes
Aristodemus, Socrates's companion in Plato's "Symposium."

[+]Of these "Parasites" or "Flies" (as owing to their migratory
habits they were sometimes called), countless stories were told,
whereof the following is a sample:  there was once a law in Athens
that not over thirty guests were to be admitted to a marriage feast,
and an officer was obliged to count all the guests and exclude the
superfluous.  A "fly" thrust in on one occasion, and the officer
said:  "Friend, you must retire.  I find one more here than the
law allows."  "Dear fellow," quoth the "fly," "you are utterly
mistaken, as you will find, if you kindly count again--only BEGINNING
WITH ME."


163.  The Dinner Proper.--The Greeks have not anticipated the Romans
in their custom of making the standard dinner party nine persons on
three couches,--three guests on each.  Prodicus has about a dozen
guests, two on a couch.  They "lie down" more or less side by side
upon the cushioned divans, with their right arms resting on brightly
striped pillows and the left arms free for eating.  The slaves bring
basis of water to wash their hands, and then beside each couch is
set a small table, already garnished with the first course, and
after the casting of a few bits of food upon the family hearth
fire,--the conventional "sacrifice" to the house gods,--the dinner
begins.

Despite the elaborate preparations of the Sicilian cook, Prodicus
offers his guests only two courses.  The first consists of the
substantial dishes--the fish, the vegetables, the meat (if there is
any).  Soups are not unknown, and had they been served might have
been eaten with spoons; but Athens like all the world is innocent
of forks, and fingers take their place.  Each guest has a large
piece of soft bread on which he wipes his fingers from time to time
and presently casts it upon the floor.[*]  When this first course
is finished, the tables are all taken out to be reset, water is
again poured over the hands of the guests, and garlands of flowers
are passed.  The use of garlands is universal, and among the
guests, old white headed and bearded Sosthenes will find nothing
more undignified in putting himself beneath a huge wreath of lilies
than an elderly gentleman of a later day will find in donning
the "conventional" dress suit.  The conversation,--which was
very scattering at first,--becomes more animated.  A little wine
is now passed about.  Then back come the tables with the second
course--fruits, and various sweetmeats and confectionary with
honey as the staple flavoring.  Before this disappears a goblet of
unmixed wine is passed about, and everybody takes a sip:  "To the
Good Genius," they say as the cup goes round.

[*]Napkins were not used in Greece before Roman days.


164.  Beginning the Symposium.--Prodicus at length gives a nod to
the chief of his corps of servers.

"Bring in the wine!" he orders.  The slaves promptly whisk out the
tables and replace them with others still smaller, on which they
set all kinds of gracefully shaped beakers and drinking bowls.  More
wreaths are distributed, also little bottles of delicate ointment.
While the guests are praising Prodicus's nard, the servants have
brought in three huge "mixing bowls" ("craters") for the wines
which are to furnish the main potation.

So far we have witnessed not a symposium, but merely a dinner; and
many a proper party has broken up when the last of the dessert has
disappeared; but, after all, the drinking bout is the real crown
of the feast.  It is not so much the wine as the things that go
with the wine that are so delightful.  As to what these desirable
condiments are, opinions differ.  Plato (who is by no means too
much of a philosopher to be a real man of the world) says in his
"Protagoras" that mere conversation is "the" thing at a symposium.
"When the company are real gentlemen and men of education, you
will see no flute girls nor dancing girls nor harp girls; they will
have no nonsense or games, but will be content with one another's
conversation."[*]  But this ideal, though commended, is not always
followed in decidedly intellectual circles.  Zenophon[+] shows us
a select party wherein Socrates participated, in which the host
has been fain to hire in a professional Syracusian entertainer with
two assistants, a boy and a girl, who bring their performance to a
climax by a very suggestive dumb-show play of the story of Bacchus
and Ariadne.  Prodicus's friends, being solid, somewhat pragmatic
men--neither young sports nor philosophers--steer a middle course.
There is a flute girl present, because to have a good symposium
without some music is almost unimaginable; but she is discreetly
kept in the background.

[*]Plato again says ("Politicus," 277 b), "To intelligent persons,
a living being is more truly delineated by language and discourse
than by any painting or work of art."

[+]In his "Symposium"--which is far less perfect as literature than
Plato's, but probably corresponds more to the average instance.


165.  The Symposiarch and his Duties.--"Let's cast for our Symposiarch!"
is Prodicus's next order, and each guest in turn rattles the dice
box.  Tyche (Lady Fortune) gives the presidency of the feast to
Eunapius, a bright-eyed, middle-aged man with a keen sense of humor,
but a correct sense of good breeding.  He assumes command of the
symposium; takes the ordering of the servants out of Prodicus's
hands, and orders the wine to be mixed in the craters with proper
dilution.  He then rises and pours out a libation from each bowl
"to the Olympian Gods," "to the Heroes," and "to Zeus the Saviour,"
and casts a little incense upon the altar.  The guests all sing a
"P√¶an," not a warrior's charging song this time, but a short hymn
in praise of the Wine-God, some lilting catch like Alc√¶us's


In mighty flagons hither bring
  The deep red blood of many a vine,
That we may largely quaff and sing
  The praises of the God of wine.


166.  Conversation at the Symposium.--After this the symposium will
proceed according to certain general rules which it is Eunaius's
duty to enforce; but in the main a "program" is something to be
avoided.  Everybody must feel himself acting spontaneously and freely.
He must try to take his part in the conversation and neither speak
too seldom nor too little.  It is not "good form" for two guests
to converse privately among themselves, nor for anybody to dwell
on unpleasant or controversial topics.  Aristophanes has laid down
after his way the proper kind of things to talk about.[*]  "[Such
as]'how Ephudion fought a fine pancratium with Ascondas though old
and gray headed, but showing great form and muscle.'  This is the
talk usual among refined people [or again] 'some manly act of your
youth; for example, how you chased a boar or a hare, or won a torch
race by some bold device.'  [Then when fairly settled at the feast]
straighten your knees and throw yourself in a graceful and easy
manner upon the couch.  Then make some observations upon the beauty
of the appointments, look up at the ceiling and praise the tapestry
of the room."

[*] "Wasps," 1174-1564.

As the wine goes around, tongues loosen more and more.  Everybody
gesticulates in delightful southern gestures, but does not lose
his inherent courtesy.  The anecdotes told are often very egoistic.
The first personal pronoun is used extremely often, and "I" becomes
the hero of a great many exploits.  The Athenian, in short, is an
adept at praising himself with affected modesty, and his companions
listen good-humoredly, and retaliate by praising themselves.


167.  Games and Entertainments.--By the time the craters are one
third emptied the general conversation is beginning to be broken
up.  It is time for various standard diversions.  Eunapius therefore
begins by enjoining on each guest in turn to sing a verse in which
a certain letter must not appear, and in event of failure to pay
some ludicrous forfeit.  Thus the bald man is ordered to begin to
comb his hair; the lame man (halt since the Mantinea campaign), to
stand up and dance to the flute player, etc.  There are all kinds of
guessing of riddles--often very ingenious as become the possessors
of "Attic salt."  Another diversion is to compare every guest
present to some mythical monster, a process which infallibly ends
by getting the "Parasite" likened to Cerberus, the Hydra, or some
such dragon, amid the laughter of all the rest.  At some point in the
amusement the company is sure to get to singing songs:--"Scolia"--drinking
songs indeed, but often of a serious moral or poetic character,
whereof the oft-quoted song in praise of Harmodius and Aristogeiton
the tyrant-slayers is a good example.[*]  No "gentleman" will profess
to be a public singer, but to have a deep, well-trained voice, and
to be able to take one's part in the symposium choruses is highly
desirable, and some of the singing at Proicus's banquet is worth
hearing.

[*]Given in "Readings in Ancient History," Vol. I, p. 117, and in
many other volumes.

Before the evening is over various games will be ordered in, especially
the "cottabus," which is in great vogue.  On the top of a high
stand, something like a candelabrum, is balanced rather delicately
a little saucer of brass.  The players stand at a considerable
distance with cups of wine.  The game is to toss a small quantity
of wine into the balanced saucer so smartly as to make the brass
give out a clear ringing sound, and to tilt upon its side.[+]  Much
shouting, merriment, and a little wagering ensues.  While most of
the company prefer the cottabus, two, who profess to be experts, call
for a gaming board and soon are deep in the "game of towns"--very
like to latter-day "checkers," played with a board divided into
numerous squares.  Each contestant has thirty colored stones, and
the effort is to surround your opponent's stones and capture them.
Some of the company, however, regard this as too profound, and
after trying their skill at the cottabus betake themselves to the
never failing chances of dice.  Yet these games are never suffered
(in refined dinner parties) to banish the conversation.  That
after all is the center, although it is not good form to talk over
learnedly of statecraft, military tactics, or philosophy.  If such
are discussed, it must be with playful abandon, and a disclaimer of
being serious; and even very grave and gray men remember Anacreon's
preference for the praise of "the glorious gifts of the Muses and
of Aphrodite" rather than solid discussions of "conquest and war."

[+]This was the simplest form of the COTTABUS game; there were
numerous elaborations, but our accounts of them are by no means
clear.


168.  Going Home from the Feast:  Midnight Revellers.--At length the
oil lamps have begun to burn dim.  The tired slaves are yawning.
Their masters, despite Prodicus's intentions of having a very
proper symposium, have all drunk enough to get unstable and silly.
Eunapius gives the signal.  All rise, and join in the final libation
to Hermes.  "Shoes and himation, boy," each says to his slave, and
with thanks to their host they all fare homeward.

Such will be the ending to an extremely decorous feast.  With gay
young bloods present, however, it might have degenerated into an
orgy; the flute girl (or several of them) would have contributed
over much to the "freedom"; and when the last deep crater had been
emptied, the whole company would have rushed madly into the street,
and gone whirling away through the darkness,--harps and flutes
sounding, boisterous songs pealing, red torches tossing.  Revellers
in this mood would be ready for anything.  Perhaps they would end in
some low tavern at the Peir√¶us to sleep off their liquor; perhaps
their leader would find some other Symposium in progress, and after
loud knockings, force his way into the house, even as did the mad
Alcibiades, who (once more to recall Plato) thrust his way into
Agathon's feast, staggering, leaning on a flute girl, and shouting,
"Where's Agathon!"  Such an inroad would be of course the signal
for more and ever more hard drinking.  The wild invaders might make
themselves completely at home, and dictate all the proceedings:
the end would be even as at Agathon's banquet, where everybody but
Socrates became completely drunken, and lay prone on the couches or
the floor.  One hopes that the honest Prodicus has no such climax
to his symposium.

...At length the streets grow quiet.  Citizens sober or drunken
are now asleep:  only the vigilant Scythian archers patrol the ways
till the cocks proclaim the first gray of dawn.





Chapter XIX.  Country Life Around Athens




169.  Importance of his Farm to an Athenian.--We have followed the
doings of a typical Athenian during his ordinary activities around
the city, but for the average gentleman an excursion outside the
town is indispensable at least every two or three days, and perhaps
every day.  He must visit his farm; for his wealth and income are
probably tied up there, rather than in any unaristocratic commercial
and manufacturing enterprises.  Homer's "royal" heroes are not
ashamed to be skilful at following the plow[*]:  and no Athenian
feels that he is contaminating himself by "trade" when he supervises
the breeding of sheep or the raising of onions.  We will therefore
follow in the tracks of certain well-to-do citizens, when we turn
toward the Itonian gate sometime during the morning, while the
Agora is still in a busy hum, even if thus we are curtailing our
hypothetical visits to the Peir√¶us or to the bankers.

[*]See Odysseus's boasts, "Odyssey," XVIII. 360 et passim.  The
gentility of farming is emphasized by a hundred precepts from
Hesiod.


170.  The Country by the Ilissus:  the Greeks and Natural Beauty.--Our
companions are on horseback (a token of tolerable wealth in Athens),
but the beasts amble along not too rapidly for nimble grooms to
run behind, each ready to aid his respective master.  Once outside
the gate the regular road swings down to the south towards Phalerum;
we, however, are in no great haste and desire to see as much as
possible.  The farms we are seeking lie well north of the city, but
we can make a delightful circuit by skirting the city walls with
the eastern shadow of the Acropolis behind us, and going at first
northeast, along the groves and leafy avenues which line the thin
stream of the Ilissus,[*] the second "river" of Athens.

[*]The Ilissus, unlike its sturdier rival, the Cephisus, ran dry
during the summer heats; but there was enough water along its bed
to create a dense vegetation.

Before us through the trees came tantalizing glimpses of the open
country running away towards shaggy gray Hymettus.  Left to itself
the land would be mostly arid and seared brown by the summer sun;
but everywhere the friendly work of man is visible.  One can count
the little green oblong patches, stretching even up the mountain
side, marked with gleaming white farm buildings or sometimes with
little temples and chapels sacred to the rural gods.  Once or
twice also we notice a plot of land which seems one tangled waste
of trees and shrubbery.  This is a sacred "temenos," an inviolate
grove, set apart to some god; and within the fences of the compound
no mortal dare set foot under pain of direful sacrilege and pollution.

Following a kind of bridle path, however, we are soon amid the
groves of olive and other trees, while the horses plod their slow
way beside the brook.  Not a few citizens going or coming from
Athens meet us, for this is really one of the parks and breathing
spaces of the closely built city.  The Athenians and Greeks in
general live in a land of such natural beauty that they take this
loveliness as a matter of course.  Very seldom do their poets
indulge in deliberate descriptions of "beautiful landscapes"; but
none the less the fair things of nature have penetrated deeply
into their souls.  The constant allusions in Homer and the other
masters of song to the great storm waves, the deep shades of the
forest, the crystal books, the pleasant rest for wanderers under
the shade trees, the plains bright with spring flowers, the ivy
twining above a grave, the lamenting nightingale, the chirping
cicada, tell their own story; men seldom describe at length what
is become warp and woof of their inmost lives.  The mere fact that
the Greeks dwell CONSTANTLY in such a beautiful land, and have
learned to love it so intensely, makes frequent and set descriptions
thereto seem trivial.


171.  Plato's Description of the Walk by the Ilissus.--Nevertheless
occasionally this inborn love of the glorious outer world must find
its expression, and it is of these very groves along he Ilissus
that we have one of the few "nature pieces" in Athenian literature.
As the plodding steeds take their way let us recall our Plato--his
"Ph≈ìdrus," written probably not many years before this our visit.

Socrates is walking with Ph√¶drus outside the walls, and urges the
latter:  "Let us go to the Ilissus and sit down in some quiet spot."
"I am fortunate," answers Ph√¶drus, "in  not having my sandals on,
and, as you never have any, we may go along the brook and cool
our feet.  This is the easiest way, and at midday is anything but
unpleasant."  He adds that they will go on to the tallest plane
tree in the distance, "where are shade and gentle breezes, and
grass whereon we may either sit or lie....  The little stream is
delightfully clear and bright.  I can fancy there might well be
maidens playing near [according to the local myth of Boreas's rape
of Orithyia]."  And so at last they come to the place, when Socrates
says:  "Yes indeed, a fair and shady resting place it is, full of
summer sounds and scents.  There is the lofty and spreading plane
tree, and the agnus castus, high and clustering in the fullest
blossom and the greatest fragrance, and the stream which flows
beneath the plane tree is deliciously cool to the feet.  Judging
by the ornaments and images [set] about, this must be a spot sacred
to Achelous and the Nymphs; moreover there is a sweet breeze and
the grasshoppers are chirruping; and the greatest charm of all is
the grass like a pillow, gently sloping to the head."[*]

[*]Jewett, translator; slightly altered.


172.  The Athenian Love of Country Life.--So the two friends had
sat them down to delve in delightful profundities; but following
the bridle path, the little brook and its groves end for us all too
soon.  We are in the open country around Athens, and the fierce
rays of Helios beat strongly on our heads.  We are outside the city,
but by no means far from human life.  Farm succeeds farm, for the
land around Athens has a goodly population to maintain, and there
is a round price for vegetables in the Agora.  Truth to tell, the
average Athenian, though he pretends to love the market, the Pnyx,
the Dicasteries, and the Gymnasia, has a shrewd hankering for the
soil, and does not care to spend more time in Athens then necessary.
Aristophanes is full of the contrasts between "country life" and
"city life" and almost always with the advantage given the former.
Says his Strepsiades (in "The Clouds"), "A country life for me--dirty,
untrimmed, lolling around at ease, and just abounding in bees and
sheep and oil cake."  His Dice√¶polis ("Acharnians") voices clearly
the independence of the farmer:  "How I long for peace.[*]  I'm
disgusted with the city; and yearn for my own farm which never
bawled out [as in the markets] 'buy my coals' or 'buy my vinegar'
or 'oil,' or KNEW the word 'buy,' but just of itself produced
everything."  And his Tryg√¶us (in "The Peace") states the case
better yet:  "Ah! how eager I am to get back into the fields, and
break up my little farm with the mattock again...[for I remember]
what kind of a life we had there; and those cakes of dried fruits,
and the figs, and the myrtles, and the sweet new wine, and the
violet bed next to the well, and the olives we so long for!"

[*]I.e. the end of the Peloponnesian War, which compelled the
farming population to remove inside the walls.

There is another reason why the Athenians rejoice in the country.
The dusty streets are at best a poor playground for the children,
the inner court of the house is only a respectable prison for the
wife.  In the country the lads can enjoy themselves; the wife and
the daughters can roam about freely with delightful absence of
convention.  There will be no happier day in the year than when
the master says, "Let us set out for the farm."


173.  Some Features of the Attic Country.--Postponing our examination
of Athenian farmsteads and farming methods until we reach some
friendly estate, various things strike us as we go along the road.
One is the skilful system of irrigation,--the numerous watercourses
drawn especially from the Cephisus, whereby the agriculturists make
use of every possible scrap of moisture for the fields, groves, and
vineyards.  Another is the occasional olive tree we see standing,
gnarled and venerable, but carefully fenced about; or even
(not infrequently) we see fences only with but a dead and utterly
worthless stump within.  Do not speak lightly of these "stumps,"
however.  They are none the less "moriai"--sacred olive trees of
Athena, and carefully tended by public wardens.[*]  Contractors
are allowed to take the fruit of the olive trees under carefully
regulated conditions; but no one is allowed to remove the stumps,
much less hew down a living tree.  An offender is tried for
"impiety" before the high court of the Areopagus, and his fate is
pretty surely death, for the country people, at least, regard their
sacred trees with a fanatical devotion which it would take long to
explain to a stranger.


[*]Athenians loved to dwell on the "divine gift" of the olive.
Thus Euripides sang ("Troades," 799):--

In Salamis, filled with the foaming
     Of billows and murmur of bees,
Old Telamon stayed from his roaming
     Long ago, on a throne of the seas,
Looking out on the hills olive laden,
     Enchanted, where first from the earth
The gray-gleaming fruit of the Maiden
     Athena had birth.

          --Murray, translator.

The hero Telamon was reputed an uncle of Achilles and one of the
early kings of Salami.


Also upon the way one is pretty sure to meet a wandering beggar--a
shrewd-eyed, bewhiskered fellow.  He carries, not a barrel organ
and monkey, but a blinking tame crow perched on his shoulder, and
at every farmstead he halts to whine his nasal ditty and ask his
dole.


Good people, a handful of barley bestow
On the child of Apollo, the sleek sable crow;
Or a trifle of whet, O kind friends, give;--
Or a wee loaf of bread that the crow may live.


It is counted good luck by the housewife to have a chance to feed
a "holy crow," and the owner's pickings are goodly.  By the time
we have left the beggar behind us we are at the farm whither our
excursion has been tending.


174.  An Attic Farmstead.--We are to inspect the landed estate of
Hybrias, the son of Xanthippus.  It lies north of Athens on the
slopes of Anchesmus, one of the lesser hills which roll away toward
the marble-crowned summits of Pentelicus.  Part of the farm lands
lie on the level ground watered by the irrigation ditches; part
upon the hillsides, and here the slopes have been terraced in a
most skilful fashion in order to make the most of every possible
inch of ground, and also to prevent any of the precious soil from
being washed down by the torrents of February and March.  The owner
is a wealthy man, and has an extensive establishment; the farm
buildings--once whitewashed, but now for the most part somewhat
dirty--wander away over a large area.  There are wide courts, deep
in manure, surrounded by barns; there are sties, haymows, carefully
closed granaries, an olive press, a grain mill, all kinds of stables
and folds, likewise a huge irregularly shaped house wherein are
lodged the numerous slaves and the hired help.  The general design
of this house is the same as of a city house--the rooms opening
upon an inner court, but naturally its dimensions are ampler, with
the ampler land space.

Just now the courtyard is a noisy and animated sight.  The master
has this moment ridden in, upon one of his periodic visits from
Athens; the farm overseer has run out to meet him and report, and
half a dozen long, lean hunting dogs--Darter, Roarer, Tracker,
Active, and more[*]--are dancing and yelping, in the hope that
their owner will order a hare hunt.  The overseer is pouring forth
his usual burden of woe about the inefficient help and the lack of
rain, and Hybrias is complaining of the small spring crop--"Zeus
send us something better this summer!"  While these worthies are
adjusting their troubles we may look around the farm.

[*]For an exhaustive list of names for Greek dogs, see Xenophon's
curious "Essay on Hunting," ch. VII, ¬ß 5.


175.  Plowing, Reaping, and Threshing.--Thrice a year the Athenian
farmer plows, unless he wisely determines to let his field lie
fallow for the nonce; and the summer plowing on hybrias's estate is
now in progress.  Up and down a wide field the ox team is going.[*]
The plow is an extremely primitive affair--mainly of wood, although
over the sharpened point which forms the plowshare a plate of iron
has been fitted.  Such a plow requires very skilful handling to
cut a good furrow, and the driver of the team has no sinecure.

[*]Mules were sometimes used for drawing the plow, but horses, it
would seem, never.

In a field near by, the hinds are reaping a crop of wheat which
was late in ripening.[*]  The workers are bending with semicircular
sickles over their hot task; yet they form a merry, noisy crowd,
full of homely "harvest songs," nominally in honor of Demeter,
the Earth Mother, but ranging upon every conceivable rustic topic.
Some laborers are cutting the grain, others, walking behind, are
binding into sheaves and piling into clumsy ox wains.  Here and
there a sheaf is standing, and we are told that this is left "for
luck," as an offering to the rural Field Spirit; for your farm
hand is full of superstitions.  Also amid the workers a youth is
passing with a goodly jar of cheap wine, to which the harvesters
make free to run from time to time for refreshment.

Close by the field is the threshing floor.  More laborers--not a few
bustling country lasses among them--are spreading out the sheaves
with wooden forks, a little at a time, in thin layers over this
circular space, which is paved with little cobblestones.  More oxen
and a patient mule are being driven over it--around and around--until
every kernel is trodden out by their hoofs.  Later will come the
tossing and the winnowing; and, when the grain has been thoroughly
cleaned, it will be stored in great earthen jars for the purpose
of sale or against the winter.


176.  Grinding at the Mill.--Nearer the farmhouses there rises a
dull grinding noise.  It is the mill preparing the flour for the
daily baking, for seldom--at least in the country--will a Greek
grind flour long in advance of the time of use.  There the round
upper millstone is being revolved upon an iron pivot against its
lower mate and turned by a long wooden handle.  Two nearly naked
slave boys are turning this wearily--far pleasanter they consider
the work of the harvesters, and very likely this task is set them
as a punishment.  As the mill revolves a slave girl pours the grain
into a hole in the center of the upper millstone.  As the hot, slow
work goes on, the two toilers chant together a snatch from an old
mill song, and we catch the monotonous strain:--


Grind, mill, grind,
For Pittacus did grind--
Who was king over great Mytilene.


It will be a long time before there is enough flour for the day.
The slaves can at least rejoice that they live on a large farm.
If Hybrias owned a smaller estate, they would probably be pounding
up the grain with mortar and pestle--more weary yet.


177.  The Olive Orchards.--We, at least, can leave them to their
work, and escape to the shade of the orchards and the vineyards.
Like every Athenian farmer, Hybrias has an olive orchard.  The
olives are sturdy trees.  They will grow in any tolerable soil and
thrive upon the mountain slopes up to as far as 1800 feet above
sea level.  They are not large trees, and their trunks are often
grotesquely gnarled, but there is always a certain fascination
about the wonderful shimmer of their leaves, which flash from gray
to silver-white in a sunny wind.  Hybrias has wisely planted his
olives at wide intervals, and in the space between the ground has
been plowed up for grain.  Olives need little care.  Their harvest
comes late in the autumn, after all the other crops are out of the
way.  They are among the most profitable products of the farm, and
the owner will not mind the poor wheat harvest "if only the olives
do well."[*]

[*]The great drawback to olive culture was the great length of time
required to mature the trees--sixteen years.  The destruction of
the trees, e.g. in war by a ravaging invader, was an infinitely
greater calamity than the burning of the standing grain or even
of the farmhouses.  Probably it was the ruin of their olive trees
which the Athenians mourned most during the ravaging of Attica in
the Peloponnesian War.


178.  The Vineyards.--The fig orchard forms another great part
of the farm, but more interesting to strangers are the vineyards.
Some of the grapes are growing over pointed stakes set all along
the upland terraces; a portion of the vineyards, however, is on
level ground.  Here a most picturesque method has been used for
training the vines.  Tall and graceful trees have been set out--elm,
maple, oak, poplar.  The lower limbs of the trees have been cut
away and up their trunks and around their upper branches now swing
the vines in magnificent festoons.  The growing vines have sprung
from tree to tree.  The warm breeze has set the rich clusters--already
turning purple or golden--swaying above our heads.  The air is
filled with brightness, greenery, and fragrance.  The effect of
this "vineyard grove" is magical.


179.  Cattle, Sheep, and Goats.--There is also room in the orchards
for apples, pears, and quinces, but there is nothing distinctive
about their culture.  If we are interested in cattle, however, we
can spend a long time at the barns, or be guided out to the upland
pasture where Hybrias's flocks and herds are grazing.  Horses are
a luxury.  They are almost never used in farm work, and for riding
and cavalry service it is best to import a good courser from
Thessaly; no attempt, therefore, is made to breed them here.  But
despite the small demand for beef and butter a good many cattle are
raised; for oxen are needed for the plowing and carting, oxhides
have a steady sale, and there is a regular call for beehives for
the hecatombs at the great public sacrifices.  Sheep are in greater
acceptance.  Their wool is of large importance to a land which knows
comparatively little of cotton.  They can live on scanty pasturage
where an ox would starve.  Still more in favor are goats  Their
coarse hair has a thousand uses.  Their flesh and cheese are among
the most staple articles in the Agora.  Sure-footed and adventurous,
they scale the side of the most unpromising crags in search of
herbage and can sometimes be seen perching, almost like birds, in
what seem utterly inaccessible eyries.  Thanks to them the barren
highlands of Attica are turned to good account,--and between goat
raising and bee culture an income can sometimes be extracted from
the very summits of the mountains.  As for the numerous swine, it
is enough to say that they range under Hybrias's oak forest and
fatten on acorns, although their swineherd, wrapped in a filthy
sheepskin, is a far more loutish and ignoble fellow than the "divine
Eum√¶us" glorified in the "Odyssey."


180.  The Gardens and the Shrine.--Did we wish to linger, we could
be shown the barnyard with its noisy retinue of hens, pheasants,
guinea fowl, and pigeons; and we would be asked to admire the geese,
cooped up and being gorged for fattening, or the stately peacocks
preening their splendors.  We would also hear sage disquisitions from
the "oldest inhabitants" on the merits of fertilizers, especially
on the uses of mixing seaweed with manure, also we would be told of
the almost equally important process of burying a toad in a sealed
jar in the midst of a field to save the corn from the crows and
the field mice.  Hybrias laughs at such superstitions--"but what
can you say to the rustics?"  Hybrias himself will display with
more refined pride the gardens used by his wife and children when
they come out from Athens,--a fountain feeding a delightful rivulet;
myrtles, roses, and pomegranate trees shedding their perfumes, which
are mingled with the odors from the beds of hyacinths, violets,
and asphodel.  In the center of the gardens rises a chaste little
shrine with a marble image and an altar, always covered with flowers
or fruit by the mistress and her women.  "To Artemis," reads the
inscription, and one is sure that the virgin goddess takes more
pleasure in this fragrant temple than in many loftier fanes.[*]

[*]For the description of a very beautiful and elaborate country
estate, with a temple thereon to Artemis, see Xenophon's "Anabasis,"
bk. V. 3.

We are glad to add here our wreaths ere turning away from this
wholesome, verdant country seat, and again taking our road to
Athens.





Chapter XX.  The Temples and Gods of Athens.




181.  Certain Factors in Athenian Religion.--We have seen the
Athenians in their business and in their pleasure, at their courts,
their assemblies, their military musters, and on their peaceful farms;
yet one great side of Athenian life has been almost ignored--the
religious side.  A "Day in Athens" spent without taking account of
the gods of the city and their temples would be a day spent with
almost half-closed eyes.[*]

[*]No attempt is made in this discussion to enumerate the various
gods and demigods of the conventional mythology, their regular
attributes, etc.  It is assumed the average history or manual of
mythology gives sufficient information.

It is far easier to learn how the Athenians arrange their houses
than how the average man among them adjusts his attitude toward
the gods.  While any searching examination of the fundamentals of
Greek cultus and religion is here impossible, two or three facts
must, nevertheless, be kept in mind, if we are to understand even
the OUTWARD side of this Greek religion which is everywhere in
evidence about us.

First of all we observe that the Greek religion is a religion of
purely natural growth.  No prophet has initiated it, or claimed
a new revelation to supplement the older views.  It has come from
primitive times without a visible break even down to the Athens of
Plato.  This explains at once why so many time-honored stories of
the Olympic deities are very gross, and why the gods seem to give
countenance to moral views which the best public opinion has long
since called scandalous and criminal.  The religion of Athens, in
other words, may justly claim to be judged by its best, not by its
worst; by the morality of Socrates, not of Homer.

Secondly, this religion is not a church, nor a belief, but is part
of the government.  Every Athenian is born into accepting the fact
that Athena Polias is the divine warder of the city, as much as
he is born into accepting the fact that it is his duty to obey the
strategi in battle.  To repudiate the gods of Athens, e.g. in favor
of those of Egypt, is as much iniquity as to join forces against
the Athenians if they are at war with Egypt;--the thing is sheer
treason, and almost unthinkable.  For countless generations the
Athenians have worshipped the "Ancestral Gods."  They are proud of
them, familiar with them; the gods have participated in all the
prosperity of the city.  Athena is as much a part of Attica as
gray Hymettus or white-crowned Pentelicus; and the very fact that
comedians, like Aristophanes, make good-natured fun of the divinities
indicates that "they are members of the family."

Thirdly, notice that this religion is one mainly of outward reverence
and ceremony.  There is no "Athenian church"; nobody has drawn up
an "Attic creed"--"I believe in Athena, the City Warder, and in
Demeter, the Earth Mother, and in Zeus, the King of Heaven, etc."
Give outward reverence, participate in the great public sacrifices,
be careful in all the minuti√¶ of private worship, refrain from
obvious blasphemies--you are then a sufficiently pious man.  What
you BELIEVE is of very little consequence.  Even if you privately
believe there are no gods at all, it harms no one, provided your
outward conduct is pious and moral.


182.  What constitutes "Piety" in Athens.--Of course there have
been some famous prosecutions for "impiety."  Socrates was the
most conspicuous victim; but Socrates was a notable worshipper of
the gods, and certainly all the charges of his being an "atheist"
broke down.  What he was actually attacked with was "corrupting
the youth of Athens," i.e. giving the young men such warped ideas
of their private and public duties that they ceased to be moral
and useful citizens.  But even Socrates was convicted only with
difficulty[*]; a generation has passed since his death.  Were he
on trial at present, a majority of the jury would probably be with
him.

[*]It might be added that if Socrates had adopted a really worldly
wise line of defense, he would probably have been acquitted, or
subjected merely to a mild pecuniary penalty.

The religion of Athens is something very elastic, and really every
man makes his own creed for himself, or--for paganism is almost
never dogmatic--accepts the outward cultus with everybody else, and
speculates at his leisure on the nature of the deity.  The great
bulk of the uneducated are naturally content to accept the old
stories and superstitions with unthinking credulity.  It is enough
to know that one must pray to Zeus for rain, and to Hermes for luck
in a slippery business bargain.  There are a few philosophers who,
along with perfectly correct outward observance, teach privately
that the old Olympian system is a snare and folly.  They pass
around the daring word which Xenophanes uttered as early as the
sixth century B.C.:--


One God there is, greatest of gods and mortals,
Not like to man is he in mind or in body.
All of him sees, all of him thinks, and all of him harkens.


This, of course, is obvious pantheism, but it is easy to cover up
all kinds of pale monotheism or pantheism under vague reference to
the omnipotence of "Zeus."


183.  The Average Athenian's Idea of the Gods.--The average
intelligent citizen probably has views midway between the stupid
rabble and the daring philosophers.  To him the gods of Greece
stand out in full divinity, honored and worshipped because they
are protectors of the good, avengers of the evil, and guardians
of the moral law.  They punish crime and reward virtue, though the
punishment may tarry long.  They demand a pure heart and a holy
mind of all that approach them, and woe to him who wantonly defies
their eternal laws.  This is the morality taught by the master
tragedians, √Üschylus and Sophocles, and accepted by the best public
opinion at Athens; for the insidious doubts cast by Euripides upon
the reality of any divine scheme of governance have never struck
home.  The scandalous stories about the domestic broils on Olympus,
in which Homer indulges, only awaken good-natured banter.  It is
no longer proper--as in Homeric days--to pride oneself on one's
cleverness in perjury and common falsehood.  Athenians do not
have twentieth century notions about the wickedness of lying, but
certain it is the gods do not approve thereof.  In short, most of
the better class of Athenians are genuinely "religious"; nevertheless
they have too many things in this human world to interest them to
spend overmuch time in adjusting their personal concepts of the
deity to any system of theology.


184.  Most Greeks without belief in Immortality.--Yet one thing we
must add.  This Greek religious morality is built up without any
clear belief in a future life.  Never has the average Hellene been
able to form a satisfactory conception of the soul's existence,
save dwelling within a mortal body and under the glorious light of
belov√®d Helios.  To Homer the after life in Hades was merely the
perpetuation of the shadows of departed humanity, "strengthless
shades" who live on the gloomy plains of asphodel, feeding upon
dear memories, and incapable of keen emotions or any real mental or
physical progress or action.  Only a few great sinners like Tantalus,
doomed to eternal torture, or favored being like Menelaus, predestined
to the "Blessed Isles," are ordained to any real immortality.  As
the centuries advanced, and the possibilities of this terrestrial
world grew ever keener, the hope of any future state became ever
more vague.  The fear of a gloomy shadow life in Hades for the
most part disappeared, but that was only to confirm the belief that
death ends all things.


Where'er his course man tends,
Inevitable death impends,
And for the worst and for the best,
Is strewn the same dark couch of rest.[*]

[*]Milman, Translator.


So run the lines of a poet whose name is forgotten, but who spoke
well the thought of his countrymen.

True there has been a contradiction of this gloomy theory.  The
"Orphic Mysteries," those secret religious rites which have gained
such a hold in many parts of Greece, including Athens, probably
hold out an earnest promise to the "initiates" of a blessed state
for them hereafter.  The doctrine of a real elysium for the good and
a realm of torment for the evil has been expounded by many sages.
Pindar, the great bard of Thebes, has set forth the doctrine in a
glowing ode.[*]  Socrates, if we may trust the report Plato gives
of him, has spent his last hours ere drinking the hemlock, in adducing
cogent, philosophic reasons for the immortality of the soul.  All
this is true,--and it is also true that these ideas have made no
impression upon the general Greek consciousness.  They are accepted
half-heartedly by a relatively few exceptional thinkers.  Men
go through life and face death with no real expectation of future
reward or punishment, or of reunion with the dear departed.  If
the gods are angry, you escape them at the grave; if the gods are
friendly, all they can give is wealth, health, honor, a hale old
age, and prosperity for your children.  The instant after death the
righteous man and the robber are equal.  This fundamental deduction
from the Greek religion must usually, therefore, be made--it is a
religion for THIS WORLD ONLY.  Let us see what are its usual outward
operations.

[*]Quoted in "Readings in Ancient History," vol. I, pp. 261-262,
and in many works in Greek literature.


185.  The Multitude of Images of the Gods.--Gods are everywhere in
Athens.  You cannot take the briefest walk without being reminded
that the world is full of deities.  There is a "Herm"[*] by the main
door of every house, as well as a row of them across the Agora.  At
many of the street crossings there are little shrines to Hecate;
or statues of Apollo Agyieus, the street guardian; or else a bay
tree stands there, a graceful reminder of this same god, to which
it is sacred.  In every house there is the small alter whereon
garlands and fruit offerings are daily laid to Zeus Herkeios, and
another altar to Hestia.  On one or both of these altars a little
food and a little wine are cast at every meal.  All public meetings
or court sessions open with sacrifice; in short, to attempt any
semi-important public or private act without inviting the friendly
attention of the deity is unthinkable.  To a well-bred Athenian
this is second instinct; he considers it as inevitable as the common
courtesies of speech among gentlemen.  Plato sums up the current
opinion well, "All men who have any decency, in the attempting of
matters great or small, always invoke divine aid."[+]

[*]A stone post about shoulder high, surmounted by a bearded head.
Contrary to modern impression, the average Greek did not conceive
of Hermes as a beautiful youth.  He was a grave, bearded man.  The
youthful aspect came through the manipulation of the Hermes myths
by the master sculptors--e.g. Praxiteles.

[+]Tim√¶us, p. 27 c.


186.  Greek Superstition.--In many cases, naturally, piety runs
off into crass superstition.  The gods, everybody knows, frequently
make known future events by various signs.  He who can understand
these signs will be able to adjust his life accordingly and
enjoy great prosperity.  Most educated men take a sensible view
of "omens," and do not let them influence their conduct absurdly.
Some, however, act otherwise.  There is, for instance, Laches,
one of the greatest at Prodicus's feast.  He lives in a realm of
mingled hopes and fears, although he is wealthy and well-educated.[*]
He is all the time worried about dreams, and paying out money
to the sharp and wily "seer" (who counts him his best client) for
"interpretations."  If a weasel crosses his path he will not walk
onward until somebody else has gone before him, or until he has
thrown three stones across the road.  He is all the time worrying
about the significance of sudden noises, meteors, thunder; especially
he is disturbed when he sees birds flying in groups or towards
unlucky quarters of the heavens.[+]  Laches, however, is not merely
religious--although he is always asking "which god shall I invoke
now?" or "what are the omens for the success of this enterprise?"
His own associates mock him as being superstitious, and say they
never trouble themselves about omens save in real emergencies.
Still it is "bad luck" for any of them to stumble over a threshold,
to meet a hare suddenly, or especially to find a snake (the companion
of the dead) hidden in the house.

[*]See Theophratus's character, "The Superstitious Man."

[+]The birds of clearest omen were the great birds of prey--hawks,
"Apollo's swift messengers," and eagles, "the birds of Zeus."  It
was a good omen if the birds flew from left to right, a bad omen
if in the reverse direction.


187.  Consulting Omens.--Laches's friends, however, all regularly
consult the omens when they have any important enterprise on hand--a
voyage, a large business venture, a marriage treaty, etc.  There
are several ways, not expensive; the interpreters are not priests,
only low-born fellows as a rule, whose fees are trifling.  You
can find out about the future by casting meal upon the altar fire
and noticing how it is burned, by watching how chickens pick up
consecrated grain,[*] by observing how the sacrificial smoke curls
upward, etc.  The best way, however, is to examine the entrails
of the victim after a sacrifice.  Here everything depends on the
shape, size, etc., of the various organs, especially of the liver,
bladder, spleen, and lungs, and really expert judgment by an experienced
and high-priced seer is desirable.  The man who is assured by a
reliable seer, "the livers are large and in fine color," will go
on his trading voyage with a confident heart.

[*]A very convenient way,--for it was a good sign if the chickens
ate eagerly and one could always get a fair omen by keeping the
fowls hungry a few hours ere "putting the question"!


188.  The Great Oracles.--Assuredly there is a better way still to
read the future; at least so Greeks of earlier ages have believed.
Go to one of the great oracles, whereof that of Apollo at Delphi
is the supreme, but not the unique, example.  Ask your question
in set form from the attendant priests, not failing to offer an
elaborate sacrifice and to bestow all the "gifts" (golden tripods,
mixing bowls, shields, etc.) your means will allow.  Then (at
Delphi) wait silent and awe-stricken while the lady Pythia, habited
as a young girl, takes her seat on a tripod over a deep cleft in
the rock, whence issues an intoxicating vapor.  She inhales the gas,
sways to and fro in an ecstasy, and now, duly "inspired," answers
in a somewhat wild manner the queries which the priest will put in
behalf of the supplicants.  Her incoherent words are very hard to
understand, but the priest duly "interprets" them, i.e. gives them
to the suppliant in the form of hexameter verses.  Sometimes the
meaning of these verses is perfectly clear.  Very often they are
truly "Delphic," with a most dubious meaning--as in that oft-quoted
instance, when the Pythia told Cr≈ìsus if he went to war with Cyrus,
"he would destroy a mighty monarchy," and lo, he destroyed his own!

Besides Delphi, there are numerous lesser oracles, each with its
distinctive method of "revelation."  But there is none, at least of
consequence, within Attica, while a journey to Delphi is a serious
and highly expensive undertaking.  And as a matter of fact Delphi
has partially lost credit in Athens.  In the great Persian War
Delphi unpatriotically "medized"--gave oracles friendly to Xerxes
and utterly discouraging to the patriot cause.  Then after this
conviction of false prophesy, the oracle fell, for most of the
time, into the hands of Sparta, and was obviously very willing
to "reveal" things only in the Laced√¶monian interest.  Hellenes
generally and the Spartans in particular have still much esteem for
the utterances of the Pythia, but Athenians are not now very partial
to her.  Soon will come the seizure of Delphi by the Ph≈ìnicians
and the still further discrediting of this once great oracle.


189.  Greek Sacrifices.--The two chief elements of Greek worship,
however, are not consideration of the future, but sacrificial and
prayer.  Sacrifices in their simple form, as we have seen, take
place continually, before every routine act.  They become more formal
when the proposed action is really important, or when the suppliant
wishes to give thanks for some boon, or, at rarer intervals, to
desire purification from some offense.  There is no need of a priest
for the simpler sacrifices.  The father of the family can pour
out the libation, can burn the food upon the altar, can utter the
prayer for all his house; but in the greater sacrifices a priest
is desirable, not as a sacred intermediary betwixt god and man,
but as an expert to advise the worshipper what are the competent
rites, and to keep him from ignorantly angering heaven by unhappy
words and actions.[*]

[*]There were almost no hereditary priesthoods in Attica (outside
the Emolpid√¶ connected with the mystical cult of Eleusis).  Almost
anybody of good character could qualify as a priest with due
training, and there was little of the sacrosanct about the usual
priestly office.

Let us witness a sacrifice of this more formal kind, and while doing
so we can tread upon the spot we have seemed in a manner to shun
during our wanderings through Athens, the famous and holy Acropolis.


190.  The Route to the Acropolis.--Phormion, son of Cresphontes, has
been to Arcadia, and won the pentathlon in some athletic contests
held at Mantinea.  Although not equal to a triumph in the "four
great Panhellenic contests," it was a most notable victory.  Before
setting out he vowed a sheep to Athena the Virgin if he conquered.
The goddess was kind, and Phormion is very grateful.  While the
multitudes are streaming out to the Gymnasia, the young athlete,
brawny and handsome, surrounded by an admiring coterie of friends
and kinsmen, sets out for the Acropolis.

Phormion's home is in the "Ceramicus," the so-called "potters'
quarter."  His walk takes him a little to the west of the Agora,
and close to the elegant temple of Heph√¶stos,[*] but past this and
many other fanes he hastens.  It was not the fire god which gave
him fair glory at Mantinea.  He goes onward until he is forced to
make a detour to the left, at the craggy, rough hill of Areopagus
which rises before him.  Here, if time did not press, he might have
tarried to pay respectful reverence before a deep fissure cleft
in the side of the rock.  In front of this fissure stands a little
altar.  All Phormion's company look away as they pass the spot,
and they mutter together "Be propitious, O Eumenides!" (literally,
Well-minded Ones).  For like true Greeks they delight to call foul
things with fair and propitious names; and that awful fissure and
altar are sacred to the Erinyes (Furies), the horrible maidens, the
trackers of guilt, the avengers of murder; and above their cave,
on these rude rocks, sits the august court of the Aeropagus when
it meets as a "tribunal of blood" to try cases of homicide.

[*]This temple, now called the "Theseum," is the only well preserved
ancient temple in modern Athens.

Phormion's party quicken their steps and quit this spot of ill
omen.  Then their sight is gladdened.  The whole glorious Acropolis
stands out before them.


191.  The Acropolis of Athens.--Almost every Greek city has its own
formidable citadel, its own "acropolis,"--for "citadel" is really
all this word conveys.  Corinth boasts of its "Acro-Corinthus,"
Thebes of its "Cadmeia,"--but THE Acropolis is in Athens.  The later
world will care little for any other, and the later world will be
right.  The Athenian stronghold has long ceased to be a fortress,
though still it rises steep and strong.  It is now one vast temple
compound, covered with magnificent buildings.  Whether considered
as merely a natural rock commanding a marvelous view, or as a
consecrated museum of sculpture and architecture, it deserves its
immortality.  We raise our eyes to THE ROCK as we approach it.

The Acropolis dominates the plain of Athens.  All the city seems
to adjust itself to the base of its holy citadel.  It lifts itself
as tawny limestone rock rising about 190 feet above the adjacent
level of the town.[*]  In form it is an irregular oval with its
axis west and east.  It is about 950 feet long and 450 feet at its
greatest breadth.  On every side but the west the precipice falls
away sheer and defiant, rendering a feeble garrison able to battle
with myriads.[+]  To the westward, however, the gradual slope makes
a natural pathway always possible, and human art has long since
shaped this with convenient steps.  Nestling in against the precipice
are various sanctuaries and caves; e.g. on the northwestern side,
high up on the slope beneath the precipice, open the uncanny grottoes
of Apollo and of Pan.  On the southern side, close under the very
shadow of the citadel, is the temple of Asclepius, and, more to
the southeast, the great open theater of Dionysus has been scooped
out of the rock, a place fit to contain an audience of some 15,000.[&]

[*]It is nearly 510 feet above the level of the sea.

[+]Recall the defense which the Acropolis was able to make against
Xerxes's horde, when the garrison was small and probably ill
organized, and had only a wooden barricade to eke out the natural
defenses.

[&]The stone seats of this theater do not seem to have been built
till about 340 B.C.  Up to that time the surface of the ground
sloping back to the Acropolis seems simply to have been smoothed
off, and probably covered with temporary wooden seats on the days
of the great dramatic festivals.

So much for the bare "bones" of the Acropolis; but now under the
dazzling sunshine how it glitters with indescribable splendor!
Before us as we ascend a whole succession of buildings seem lifting
themselves, not singly, not in hopeless confusion, but grouped
admirably together by a kind of wizardry, so that the harmony is
perfect,--each visible, brilliant column and pinnacle, not merely
flashing its own beauty, but suggesting another greater beauty just
behind.


192.  The Use of Color upon Athenian Architecture and Sculptures.--While
we look upward at this group of temples and their wealth of
sculptures, let us state now something we have noticed during all
our walks around Athens, but have hitherto left without comment.
Every temple and statue in Athens is not left in its bare white
marble, as later ages will conceive is demanded by "Greek Architecture"
and statuary, but is decked in brilliant color--"painted," if you
will use an almost unfriendly word.  The columns and gables and
ceilings of the buildings are all painted.  Blue, red, green, and
gold blaze on all the members and ornaments.  The backgrounds of
the pediments, metopes, and frieze are tinted some uniform color
on which the sculptured figures in relief stand out clearly.  The
figures themselves are tinted or painted, at least on the hair,
lips, and eyes.  Flesh-colored warriors are fighting upon a bright
red background.  The armor and horse trappings on the sculptures
are in actual bronze.  The result is an effect indescribably vivid.
Blues and reds predominate:  the flush of light and color from the
still more brilliant heavens above adds to the effect.  Shall we
call it garish?  We have learned to know the taste of Athenians
too well to doubt their judgment in matters of pure beauty.  And
they are right.  UNDER AN ATHENIAN SKY temples and statues demand
a wealth of color which in a somber clime would seem intolerable.
The brilliant lines of the Acropolis buildings are the just answer
of the Athenian to the brilliancy of Helios.


193.  The Chief Buildings on the Acropolis.--And now to ascend the
Acropolis.  We leave the discussion of the details of the temples
and the sculpture to the architects and arch√¶ologists.  The whole
plateau of the Rock is covered with religious buildings, altars,
and statues.  We pass through the Propyl√¶a, the worthy rival of
the Parthenon behind, a magnificent portal, with six splendid Doric
columns facing us; and as we go through them, to right and to left
open out equally magnificent columned porticoes.[*]  As we emerge
from the Propyl√¶a the whole vision of the sacred plateau bursts
upon us simultaneously.  We can notice only the most important of
the buildings.  At the southwestern point of the Acropolis on the
angle of rock which juts out beyond the Propyl√¶a is the graceful
little temple of the "Wingless Victory," built in the Ionic style.
The view commanded by its bastion will become famous throughout the
world.  Behind this, nearer the southern side, stands the less
important temple of Artemis Braur√∂nia.  Nearer the center and directly
before the entrance rises a colossal brazen statue--"monstrous,"
many might call its twenty-six feet of height, save that a master
among masters has cast the spell of his genius over it.  This is
the famous Athena Promachos,[+] wrought by Phidias out of the spoils
of Marathon.  The warrior goddess stands in full armor and rests
upon her mighty lance.  The gilded lance tip gleams so dazzlingly
we may well believe the tale that sailors use it for a first landmark
as they sail up the coast from Cape Sunium.

[*]That to the north was the larger and contained a kind of picture
gallery.

[+]Athena Foremost in Battle.

Looking again upon the complex of buildings we single out another
on the northern side:  an irregularly shaped temple, or rather
several temples joined together, the Erechtheum, wherein is the
sanctuary of Athena Polias (the revered "City Warden"), the ancient
wooden statue, grotesque, beloved, most sacred of all the holy
images in Athens.  And here on the southern side of this building
is the famous Caryatid porch; the "Porch of the Maidens," which
will be admired as long as Athens has a name.  But our eyes refuse
to linger long on any of these things.  Behind the statue of the
Promachos, a little to the southern side of the plateau, stands
the Parthenon--the queen jewel upon the crown of Athens.


194.  The Parthenon.--Let others analyze its sculptures and explain
the technical reasons why Ictinus and Callicrates, the architects,
and Phidias, the sculptor, created here the supreme masterpiece
for the artistic world.  We can state only the superficialities.
It is a noble building by mere size; 228 feet measure its side,
101 feet its front.  Forty-six majestic Doric columns surround it;
they average thirty-four feet in height, and six feet three inches
at the base.  All these facts, however, do not give the soul of
the Parthenon.  Walk around it slowly, tenderly, lovingly.  Study
the elaborate stories told by the pediments,--on the east front
the birth of Athena, on the west the strife of Athena and Poseidon
for the possession of Athens.  Trace down the innumerable lesser
sculptures on the "metopes" under the cornice,--showing the battles
of the Giants, Centaurs, Amazons, and of the Greeks before Troy;
finally follow around, on the whole inner circuit of the body of
the temple, the frieze,[*] showing in bas-relief the Panathenaic
procession, with the beauty, nobility, and youth of Athens marching
in glad festival; comprehend that these sculptures will never be
surpassed in the twenty-four succeeding centuries; that here are
supreme examples for the artists of all time,--and THEN, in the
face of this final creation, we can realize that the Parthenon will
justify its claim to immortality.

[*]This, of course, is on the outside wall of the "cells," but
inside the surrounding colonnade.

One thing more.  There are hardly any straight lines in the Parthenon.
To the eye, the members and the steps of the substructure may seem
perfectly level; but the measuring rod betrays marvelously subtle
curves.  As nature abhors right angles in her creations of beauty,
so have these Greeks.  Rigidity, unnaturalness, have been banished.
The Parthenon stands, not merely embellished with inimitable
sculptures, but perfectly adjusted to the natural world surrounding.[*]

[*]It was an inability to discover and execute these concealed
curves which give certain of the modern imitations of the Parthenon
their unpleasant impressions of harness and rigidity.

We have seen only the exterior of the Parthenon.  We must wait now
ere visiting the interior, for Phormion is beginning his sacrifice.


195.  A Sacrifice on the Acropolis.--Across the sacred plateau
advances the little party.  As it goes under the Propyl√¶a a couple
of idle temple watchers[*] give its members a friendly nod.  The
Acropolis rock itself seems deserted, save for a few worshippers
and a party of admiring Ach√¶an visitors who are being shown the
glories of the Parthenon.[+]  There seems to be a perfect labyrinth
of statues of gods, heroes, and departed worthies, and almost as
many altars, great and small, placed in every direction.  Phormion
leads his friends onward till they come near to the wide stone
platform somewhat in the rear of the Parthenon.  Here is the "great
altar" of Athena, whereon the "hecatombs" will be sacrificed, even
a hundred oxen or more,[&] at some of the major public festivals;
and close beside it stands also a small and simple altar sacred
to Athena Parthenos, Athena the Virgin.  Suitable attendants have
been in readiness since dawn waiting for worshippers.  One of
Phormion's party leads behind him a bleating white lamb "without
blemish."[$]  It is a short matter now to bring the firewood and
the other necessaries.  The sacrifice takes place without delay.

[*]The most important function of these watchers seems to have been
to prevent dogs from entering the Acropolis.  Probably they were
inefficient old men favored with sinecure offices.

[+]The Acropolis seems to have become a great "show place" for
visitors to Athens soon after the completion of the famous temples.

[&]We know by an inscription of 169 oxen being needed for a single
Athenian festival.

[$]This was a very proper creature to sacrifice to a great Olympian
deity like Athena.  Goats were not suitable for her, although desirable
for most of the other gods.  It was unlawful to sacrifice swine to
Aphrodite.  When propitiating the gods of the underworld,--Hades,
Persephone, etc.,--a BLACK victim was in order.  Poor people could
sacrifice doves, cocks, and other birds.

First a busy "temple sweeper" goes over the ground around the altar
with a broom; then the regular priest, a dignified gray-headed man
with a long ungirt purple chiton, and a heavy olive garland, comes
forward bearing a basin of holy water.  This basin is duly passed
to the whole company as it stands in a ring, and each in turn dips
his hand and sprinkles his face and clothes with the lustral water.
Meantime the attendant has placed another wreath around the head
of the lamb.  The priest raises his hand.

"Let there be silence," he commands (lest any unlucky word be
spoken); and in a stillness broken only by the auspicious twittering
of the sparrows amid the Parthenon gables, he takes barley corns
from a basket, an sprinkles them on the altar and over the lamb.
With his sacred knife he cuts a lock of hair from the victims head
and casts it on the fire.  Promptly now the helper comes forward
to complete the sacrifice.  Phormion and his friends are a little
anxious.  Will the lamb take fright, hang back, and have to be
dragged to its unwilling death?  The clever attendant has cared
for that.  A sweet truss of dried clover is lying just under the
altar.  The lamb starts forward, bleating joyously.  As it bows its
head[*] as if consenting to its fate the priest stabs it dexterously
in the neck with his keen blade.  The helper claps a bowl under
the neck to catch the spurting blood.  A flute player in readiness,
but hitherto silent, suddenly strikes up a keen blast to drown the
dying moans of the animal.  Hardly has the lamb ceased to struggle
before the priest and the helper have begun to cut it up then and
there.  Certain bits of the fat and small pieces from each limb
are laid upon the altar, and promptly consumed.  These are the
goddess's peculiar portion, and the credulous at least believe
that she, though unseen, is present to eat thereof; certainly the
sniff of the burning meat is grateful to her divine nostrils.  The
priest and the helpers are busy taking off the hide and securing
the best joint--these are their "fees" for professional services.
All the rest will be duly gathered up by Phormion's body servant
and borne home,--for Phormion will give a fine feast on "sacred
mutton" that night.[+]

[*]If a larger animal--an ox--failed to bow its head auspiciously,
the omen could be rectified by suddenly splashing a little water
in the ears.

[+]As already suggested (section 159) a sacrifice (public, or, if
on a large scale, private) was about the only occasion on which
Athenians tasted beef, pork, or mutton.

Meantime, while the goddess's portion burns, Phormion approaches
the altar, bearing a shallow cup of unmixed wine, and flings it
upon the flame.

"Be propitious, O Lady," he cries, "and receive this my drink
offering."[*]

[*]The original intention of this libation at the sacrifice was very
clearly to provide the gods with wine to "wash down" their meat.

The sacrifice is now completed.  The priest assures Phormion that
the entrails of the victim foretokened every possible favor in
future athletic contests--and this, and his insinuating smile, win
him a silver drachma to supplement his share of the lamb.  Phormion
readjusts the chaplet upon his own head, and turns towards the
Parthenon.  After the sacrifice will come the prayer.


196.  The Interior of the Parthenon and the Great Image of Athena.--The
whole Acropolis is the home of Athena.  The other gods harbored
thereon are only her inferior guests.  Upon the Acropolis the dread
goddess displays her many aspects.  In the Erechtheum we worship
her as Athena Polias, the ancient guardian of the hearths and homes
of the city.  In the giant Promachus, we see her the leader in
war,--the awful queen who went with her fosterlings to the deadly
grappling at Marathon and at Salamis; in the little temple of
"Wingless Victory"[*] we see her as Athena the Victorious, triumphant
over Barbarian and Hellenic foe; but in the Parthenon we adore in
her purest conception--the virgin queen, now chaste and clam, her
battles over, the pure, high incarnations of all "the beautiful and
the good" that may possess spirit and mind,--the sovran intellect,
in short, purged of all carnal, earthy passion.  It is meet that
such a goddess should inhabit such a dwelling as the Parthenon.[+]

[*]The term "Wingless Victory" (Nik√´ Apteros) has reference to a
special type and aspect of Athena, not to the goddess Nik√´ (Victory)
pure and simple.

[+]There was still another aspect in which Athena was worshipped on
the Acropolis.  She had a sacred place ("temenos"), though without
a temple, sacred to her as Athena Ergan√´--Athena Protectress of
the Arts.

Phormion passes under the eastern porch, and does not forget
(despite the purification before the sacrifice) to dip the whisk
broom, lying by the door, in the brazen laver of holy water and
again to sprinkle himself.  He passes out of the dazzling sunlight
into a chamber that seems at first to be lost in a vast, impenetrable
gloom.  He pauses and gazes upward; above him, as little by little
his eyes get their adjustment, a faint pearly light seems streaming
downward.  It is coming through the translucent marble slabs of the
roof of the great temple.[*]  Then out of the gloom gleam shapes,
objects,--a face.  He catches the glitter of great jewels and of
massy gold, as parts of the rich garments and armor of some vast
image.  He distinguishes at length a statue,--the form of a woman,
nearly forty feet in height.  Her left wrist rests upon a mighty
shield; her right hand holds a winged "Victory," itself of nigh human
size.  Upon her breast is the awful √¶gis, the especial breastplate
of the high gods.  Around the foot of her shield coils a serpent.
Upon her head is a might helmet.  And all the time that these things
are becoming manifest, evermore clearly one beholds the majestic
face,--sweetness without weakness, intellectuality without coldness,
strength mingled justly with compassion.  This is the Athena
Parthenos, the handiwork of Phidias.[+]

[*]This seems to be the most reasonable way to assume that the
"cella" of the Parthenon was lighted, in view of the danger, in case
of open skylights, of damage to the holy image by wind and rain.

[+]Of this statue no doubt there could be said what Dion Chrysostomos
said of the equally famous "Zeus" erected by Phidias at Olympia.
"The man most depressed with woes, forgot his ills whilst gazing
on this statue, so much light and beauty had Phidias infused within
it."  Besides the descriptions in the ancient writers we get a
clear idea of the general type of the Athena Parthenos from recently
discovered statuettes, especially the "Varvakeion" model (401/2
inches high).  This last is cold and lifeless as a work of art, but
fairly accurate as to details.  [Note from Brett:  In 2001, this
remains the best statue ever found representing Athena Parthenos
and a detailed analysis of the effect of the original statue on the
populous can be found at http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/CC96/lapatin.htm.
The statuette itself is currently in the Athens Museum.]

We will not heap up description.  What boots it to tell that the
arms and vesture of this "chryselephantine" statue are of pure
gold; that the flesh portions are of gleaming ivory; that Phidias
has wrought the whole so nobly together that this material, too
sumptuous for common artists, becomes under his assembling the
perfect substance for the manifestation of deity?

...Awestruck by the vision, though often he has seen it, Phormion
stands long in reverent silence.  Then at length, casting a pinch
of incense upon the brazier, constantly smoking before the statue,
he utters his simple prayer.


197.  Greek Prayers.--Greek prayers are usually very pragmatic.
"Who," asks Cicero, who can speak for both Greeks and Romans in
this particular, "ever thanked the gods that he was a good man?  Men
are thankful for riches, honor, safety....  We beg of the sovran
God [only] what makes us safe, sound, rich and prosperous."[*]
Phormion is simply a very average, healthy, handsome young Athenian.
While he prays he stretches his hands on high, as is fitting to a
deity of Olympus.[+]  His petition runs much as follows:--


"Athena, Queen of the √Ügis, by whatever name thou lovest best,[&]
give ear.

"Inasmuch as thou dids't heed my vow, and grant me fair glory at
Mantinea, bear witness I have been not ungrateful.  I have offered
to thee a white sheep, spotless and undefiled.  And now I have it
in my mind to attempt the pentathlon at the next Isthmia at Corinth.
Grant me victory even in that; and not one sheep but five, all as
good as this to-day, shall smoke upon thine altar.  Grant also unto
me, my kinsmen and all my friends, health, riches and fair renown."

[*]Cicero, "De Nat. Deor," ii. 36.

[+]In praying to a deity of the lower world the hands would be held
down.  A Greek almost NEVER knelt, even in prayer.  He would have
counted it degrading.

[&]This formula would be put in, lest some favorite epithet of the
divinity be omitted.

A pagan prayer surely; and there is a still more pagan epilogue.
Phormion has an enemy, who is not forgotten.

"And oh! gracious, sovran Athena, blast my enemy Xenon, who strove
to trip me foully in the foot race.  May his wife be childless or
bear him only monsters; may his whole house perish; may all his
wealth take flight; may his friends forsake him; may war soon cut
him off, or may he die amid impoverished, dishonored old age.  If
this my sacrifice has found favor in thy sight, may all these evils
come upon him unceasingly.  And so will I adore the and sacrifice
unto thee all my life."[*]

[*]Often a curse would become a real substitute for a prayer; e.g.
at Athens, against a rascally and traitorous general, a solemn
public curse would be pronounced at evening by all the priests and
priestesses of the city, each shaking in the air a red cloth in
token of the bloody death to which the offender was devoted.

The curse then is a most proper part of a Greek prayer!  Phormion
is not conscious of blasphemy.  He merely follows invariable custom.

It is useless to expect "Christian sentiments" in the fourth century
B.C., yet perhaps an age should be judged not by its average, but
by its best.  Athenians can utter nobler prayers than those of
the type of Phormion.  Xenophon makes his model young householder
Ishomenus pray nobly "that I may enjoy health and strength of body,
the respect of my fellow citizens, honorable safety in times of
war, and wealth honestly increased."[*]

[*]Xenophon, "The Economist," xi, p. 8.

There is a simple little prayer also which seems to be a favorite
with the farmers.  Its honest directness carries its own message.

"Rain, rain, dear Zeus, upon the fields of the Athenians and the
plains."[*]

[*]It was quoted later to us by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who
adds, "In truth, we ought not to pray at all, or we ought to pray
in this simple and noble fashion."

Higher still ascends the prayer of Socrates, when he begs for
"the good" merely, leaving it to the wise gods to determine what
"the good" for him may be; and in one prayer, which Plato puts in
Socrates's mouth, almost all the best of Greek ideals and morality
seems uttered.  It is spoken not on the Acropolis, but beside the
Ilissus at the close of the delightful walk and chat related in
the "Ph≈ìdrus."

"Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give me
the beauty of the inward soul, and may the outward and the inward
man be joined in perfect harmony.  May I reckon the wise to be
wealthy, and may I have such a quantity of gold as none but the
temperate can carry.  Anything more?--That prayer, I think, is
enough for me."

Phormion and his party are descending to the city to spend the
evening in honest mirth and feasting, but we are fain to linger,
watching the slow course of the shadows as they stretch across the
Attic hills.  Sea, sky, plain, mountains, and city are all before
us, but we will not spend words upon them now.  Only for the
buildings, wrought by Pericles and his might peers, we will speak
out our admiration.  We will gladly confirm the words Plutarch
shall some day say of them, "Unimpaired by time, their appearance
retains the fragrance of freshness, as though they had been inspired
by an eternally blooming life and a never aging soul."[*]

[*]Plutarch wrote this probably after 100 A.D., when the Parthenon
had stood for about five and half centuries.





Chapter XXI.  The Great Festivals of Athens.




198.  The Frequent Festivals at Athens.--Surely our "Day in Athens"
has been spent from morn till night several times over, so much
there is to see and tell.  Yet he would be remiss who left the city
of Athena before witnessing at least several of the great public
festivals which are the city's noble pride.  There are a prodigious
number of religions festivals in Athens.[*]  They take the place
of the later "Christian Sabbath" and probably create a somewhat
equal number of rest days during the year, although at more irregular
intervals.  They are far from being "Scotch Sundays,"[+] however.
On them the semi-riotous "joy of life" which is part of the Greek
nature finds its fullest, ofttimes its wildest, expression.  They
are days of merriment, athletic sports, great civic spectacles,
chorals, public dances.[&]  To complete our picture of Athens we
must tarry for a swift cursory glance upon at least three of these
f√™te days of the city of Pericles, Sophocles, and Phidias.

[*]In Gulick ("Life of the Ancient Greeks," pp. 304-310) there is
a valuable list of Attic festivals.  The Athenians had over thirty
important religious festivals, several of them, e.g., the Thesmorphoria
(celebrated by the women in honor of Demeter), extending over a
number of days.

[+][NOTE from Brett:  A "Scotch Sunday" refers to the practice of
the Sabbath day in Scotland.  During the Sabbath day (at the time
of the author of this work) in Scotland no activity goes on except
for Church.  There is no travel, no telecommunication, no cooking,
not allowed to read the newspaper, etc.  A "Scotch Sunday" therefore,
represents a day of religious austerity.]

[&]It is needless to point out that to the Greeks, as to many other
ancient peoples,--for example, the Hebrews,--DANCING often had a
religious significance and might be a regular part of the worship
of the gods.


199.  The Eleusinia.--Our first festival is the Eleusinia, the
festival of the Eleusinian mysteries.  It is September, the "19th
of Bo√´dromi√∂n," the Athenians will say.  Four days have been spent
by the "initiates" and the "candidates" in symbolic sacrifices
and purifications.[*]  On one of these days the arch priest, the
"Hierophant," has preached a manner of sermon at the Painted Porch
in the Agora setting forth the awfulness and spiritual efficacy
of these Mysteries, sacred to Demeter the Earth Mother, to her
daughter Persephone, and also to the young Iacchus, one of the many
incarnations of Dionysus, and who is always associated at Elusis
with the divine "Mother and Daughter."  The great cry has gone
forth to the Initiates--"To the Sea, ye Myst√¶!" and the whole vast
multitude has gone down to bathe in the purifying brine.

[*]Not all Athenians were among the "initiated," but it does not
seem to have been hard to be admitted to the oaths and examination
which gave one participation in the mysteries.  About all a candidate
had to prove was blameless character.  Women could be initiated as
well as men.

Now on this fifth day comes the sacred procession from Athens across
the mountain pass to Eleusis.  The participates, by thousands, of
both sexes and of all ages, are drawn up in the Agora ere starting.
The Hierophant, the "Torchbearer," the "Sacred Herald," and the other
priests wear long flowing raiment and high mitres like Orientals.
They also, as well as the company, wear myrtle and ivy chaplets and
bear ears of corn and reapers' sickles.  The holy image of Iacchus
is borne in a car, the high priests marching beside it; and forth
with pealing shout and chant they go,--down the Ceramicus, through
the Dipylon gate, and over the hill to Eleusis, twelve miles away.


200.  The Holy Procession to Eleusis.--Very sacred is the procession,
but not silent and reverential.  It is an hour when the untamed
animal spirits of the Greeks, who after all are a young race and
who are gripped fast by natural instinct, seem uncurbed.  Loud
rings the "orgiastic" cry, "Iacch√´! Iacch√´! evo√´!"

There are wild shouts, dances, jests, songs,[*] postures.  As the
marchers pass the several sanctuaries along the road there are halts
for symbolic sacrifices.  So the multitude slowly mounts the long
heights of Mount √Ügaleos, until--close to the temple of Aphrodite
near the summit of the pass--the view opens of the broad blue bay
of Eleusis, shut in by the isle of Salamis, while to the northward
are seen the green Thrasian plain, with the white houses of Eleusis
town[+] near the center, and the long line of outer hills stretching
away to Megara and B≈ìotia.

[*]We do not possess the official chant of the Myst√¶ used on their
march to Eleusia.  Very possibly it was of a swift riotous nature
like the Bacchinals' song in Euripides "Bacchinals" (well translated
by Way or by Murray).

[+]This was about the only considerable town in Attica outside of
Athens.

The evening shadows are falling, while the peaceful army sweeps
over the mountain wall and into Eleusis.  Every marcher produces
a torch, and bears it blazing aloft as he nears his destination.
Seen in the dark from Eleusis, the long procession of innumerable
torches must convey an effect most magical.


201.  The Mysteries of Eleusis.--What follows at Eleusis?  The
"mysteries" are "mysteries" still; we cannot claim initiation and
reveal them.  There seem to be manifold sacrifices of a symbolic
significance, the tasting of sacred "portions" of food and drink--a
dim foreshadowing of the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist;
especially in the great hall of the Temple of the Myst√¶ in Eleusis
there take place a manner of symbolic spectacles, dramas perhaps
one may call them, revealing the origins of Iacchus, the mystical
union of Persephone and Zeus, and the final joy of Demeter.

This certainly we can say of these ceremonies.  They seem to have
afforded to spiritually minded men a sense of remission of personal
sin which the regular religion could never give; they seem also
to have conveyed a fair hope of immortality, such as most Greeks
doubted.  Sophocles tells thus the story:  "Thrice blessed are they
who behold these mystical rites, ere passing to Hades' realm.  They
alone have life there.  For the rest all things below are evil."[*]
And in face of imminent death, perhaps in hours of shipwreck, men
are wont to ask one another, "Have you been initiated at Eleusis?"

[*]Sophocles, "Frag." 719.


202.  The Greater Dionysia and the Drama.--Again we are in Athens
in the springtime:  "The eleventh of Elapheboli√∂n" [March].  It is
the third day of the Greater Dionysia.  The city has been in high
festival; all the booths in the Agora hum with redoubled life;
strangers have flocked in from outlying pars of Hellas to trade,
admire, and recreate; under pretext of honoring the wine god,
inordinate quantities of wine are drunk with less than the prudent
mixture of water.  There is boisterous frolicking, singing, and
jesting everywhere.  It is early blossom time.  All whom you meet
wear huge flower crowns, and pelt you with the fragrant petals of
spring.[*]

[*]Pindar ("Frag." 75) says thus of the joy and beauty of this f√™te:
"[Lo!] this festival is due when the chamber of the red-robed Hours
is opened and odorous plants wake to the fragrant spring.  then
we scatter on undying earth the violet, like lovely tresses, and
twine roses in our hair; then sound the voice of song, the flute
keeps time, and dancing choirs resound the praise of Semele."

So for two days the city has made merry, and now on the third,
very early, "to the theater" is the word on every lip.  Magistrates
in their purple robes of office, ambassadors from foreign states,
the priests and religious dignitaries, are all going to the front
seats of honor.  Ladies of gentle family, carefully veiled but eager
and fluttering, are going with their maids, if the productions of
the day are to be tragedies not comedies.[*]  All the citizens are
going, rich and poor, for here again we meet "Athenian democracy";
and the judgment and interest of the tatter-clad fishermen seeking
the general "two-obol" seats may be almost as correct and keen as
that of the lordly Alcm√¶noid in his gala himation.

[*]It seems probable (on our uncertain information) that Athenian
ladies attended the moral and proper tragedies.  It was impossible
for them to attend the often very coarse comedies.  Possibly at
the tragedies they sat in a special and decently secluded part of
the theater.


203.  The Theater of Dionysus.--Early dawn it is when the crowds
pour through the barriers around the Theater of Dionysus upon the
southern slope of the Acropolis.  They sit (full 15,000 or more)
wedged close together upon rough wooden benches set upon the hill
slopes.[*]  At the foot of their wide semicircle is a circular
space of ground, beaten hard, and ringed by a low stone barrier.
It is some ninety feet in diameter.  This is the "orchestra," the
"dancing place," wherein the chorus may disport itself and execute
its elaborate figures.  Behind the orchestra stretches a kind
of tent or booth, the "sken√´."  Within this the actors may retire
to change their costumes, and the side nearest to the audience is
provided with a very simple scene,--some kind of elementary scenery
panted to represent the front of a temple or palace, or the rocks,
or the open country.  This is nearly the entire setting.[+]  If
there are any slight changes of this screen, they must be made in
the sight of the entire audience.  The Athenian theater has the blue
dome of heaven above it, the red Acropolis rock behind it.  Beyond
the "sken√´" one can look far away to the country and the hills.
The keen Attic imagination will take the place of the thousand
arts of the later stage-setter.  Sophocles and his rivals, even as
Shakespeare in Elizabeth's England, can sound the very depths and
scale the loftiest heights of human passion, with only a simulacrum
of the scenery, properties, and mechanical artifices which will
trick out a very mean twentieth century theater.

[*]These benches (before the stone theater was built in 340 B.C.)
may be imagined as set up much like the "bleachers" at a modern
baseball park.  We know that ancient audiences wedged in very close.

[+]I think it is fairly certain that the classical Attic theater
was without any stage, and that the actors appeared on the same
level as the chorus.  As to the extreme simplicity of all the
scenery and properties there is not the least doubt.


204.  The production of a Play.--The crowds are hushed and expectant.
The herald, ere the play begins, proclaims the award of a golden
crown to some civic benefactor:  a moment of ineffable joy to the
recipient; for when is a true Greek happier than when held up for
public glorification?  Then comes the summons to the first competing
poet.

"Lead on your chorus."[*]  The intellectual feast of the Dionysia
has begun.

[*]In the fourth century B.C. when the creation of original tragedies
was in decline, a considerable part of the dionysia productions
seem to have been devoted to the works of the earlier masters,
√Üschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.

To analyze the Attic drama is the task of the philosopher and the
literary expert.  We observe only the superficialities.  There are
never more than THREE speaking actors before the audience at once.
They wear huge masques, shaped to fit their parts.  The wide
mouthpieces make the trained elocution carry to the most remote
parts of the theater.  The actors wear long trailing robes and are
mounted on high shoes to give them sufficient stature before the
distant audience.  When a new part is needed in the play, an actor
retires to the booth, and soon comes forth with a changed masque
and costume--an entirely new character.  In such a costume and
masque, play of feature and easy gesture is impossible; but the
actors carry themselves with a stately dignity and recite their often
ponderous lines with a grace which redeems them from all bombast.
An essential part of the play is the chorus; indeed the chorus
was once the main feature of the drama, the actors insignificant
innovations.  With fifteen members for the tragedy, twenty-four for
the comedy,[*] old men of Thebes, Trojan dames, Athenian charcoal
burners, as the case may demand--they sympathize with the hard-pressed
hero, sing lusty choral odes, and occupy the time with song and
dance while the actors are changing costume.

[*]In the "Middle" and "Later" comedy, so called, the chorus entirely
disappears.  The actors do everything.

The audience follows all the philosophic reasoning of the tragedies,
the often subtle wit of the comedies, with that same shrewd alertness
displayed at the jury courts of the Pnyx.  "Authis! Authis!"
(again! again!) is the frequent shout, if approving.  Date stones
and pebbles as well as hootings are the reward of silly lines or bad
acting.  At noon there is an interlude to snatch a hasty luncheon
(perhaps without leaving one's seat).  Only when the evening
shadows are falling does the chorus of the last play approach the
altar in the center of the orchestra for the final sacrifice.  A
whole round of tragedies have been given.[*]  The five public judges
announce their decision:  an ivy wreath to the victorious poet; to
his "choregus" (the rich man who has provided his chorus and who
shares his glory) the right to set up a monumnet in honor of the
victory.  Home goes the multitude,--to quarrel over the result,
to praise or blame the acting, to analyze the remarkable acuteness
the poet's handling of religious, ethical, or social questions.

[*]Comedies, although given at this Dionysia, were more especially
favored at the Len√¶a, an earlier winter festival.

The theater, like the dicasteries and the Pnyx, is one of the great
public schools of Athens.


205.  The Great Panathenaic Procession.--Then for the last time
let us visit Athens, at the f√™te which in its major form comes only
once in four years.  It is the 28th of Metageitni√∂n (August), and
the eighth day of the Greater Panathen√¶a, the most notable of all
Athenian festivals.  By it is celebrated the union of all Attica
by Theseus, as one happy united country under the benign sway of
might Athena,--an ever fortunate union, which saved the land from
the sorrowful feuds of hostile hamlets such as have plagued so many
Hellenic countries.  On the earlier days of the feast there have
been musical contests and gymnastic games much after the manner of
the Olympic games, although the contestants have been drawn from
Attica only.  There has been a public recital of Homer.  Before a
great audience probably at the Pnyx or the Theater a rhapsodist of
noble presence--clad in purple and with a golden crown--has made
the Trojan War live again, as with his well-trained voice he held
the multitude spellbound by the music of the stately hexameters.

Now we are at the eighth day.  All Athens will march in its glory
to the Acropolis, to bear to the shrine of Athena the sacred
"peplos"--a robe specially woven by the noble women of Athens to
adorn the image of the guardian goddess.[*]  The houses have opened;
the wives, maids, and mothers of gentle family have come forth to
march in the procession, all elegantly wreathed and clad in their
best, bearing the sacred vessels and other proper offerings.  The
daughter of the "metics," the resident foreigners, go as attendants
of honor with them.  The young men and the old, the priests, the
civil magistrates, the generals, all have their places.  Proudest
of all are the wealthy and high-born youths of the cavalry, who
now dash to and fro in their clattering pride.  The procession is
formed in the outer Ceramicus.  Amid cheers, chants, chorals, and
incense smoke it sweeps through the Agora, and slowly mounts the
Acropolis.  Center of all the marchers is the glittering peplos,
raised like a sail upon a wheeled barge of state--"the ship
of Athena."  Upon the Acropolis, while the old peplos is piously
withdrawn from the image and the new one substituted, there is a
prodigious sacrifice.  A might flame roars heavenward from the "great
altar"; while enough bullocks[+] and kine[&] have been slaughtered
to enable every citizen--however poor--to bear away a goodly mess
of roasted meat that night.

[*]Not that this robe was for the revered ancient and wooden image
of Athena Polias, not for the far less venerable statue of Athena
Parthenos.

[+][NOTE from Brett:  A bullock is a young, possibly castrated,
bull.]

[&][NOTE from Brett:  kine is the archaic plural form of "cow."]


206.  The View from the Temple of Wingless Victory.--We will not
wait for the feasting but rather will take our way to the Temple
of Wingless Victory, looking forth to the west of the Acropolis
Rock.  So many things we see which we would fain print on the memory.
Behind us we have just left the glittering Parthenon, and the less
august but hardly less beautiful Erechtheum, with its "Porch of
the Maidens."  To our right is the wide expanse of the roofs of the
city and beyond the dark olive groves of Colonus, and the slopes
of √Ügaleos.  In the near foreground, are the red crags of Areopagus
and the gray hill of the Pnyx.  But the eye will wander farther.
It is led away across the plainland to the bay of Phaleron, the
castellated hill of Munychia, the thin stretch of blue water and
the brown island seen across it--Salamis and its strait of the
victory.  Across the sparkling vista of the sea rise the headlands
of √Ügina and of lesser isles; farther yet rise the lordly peaks of
Argolis.  Or we can look to the southward.  Our gaze rounds down the
mountainous Attic coast full thirty miles to where Sunium thrusts
out its haughty cape into the √Ügean and points the way across the
island-studded sea.

Evening is creeping on.  Behind us sounds the great p√¶an, the
solemn chant to Athena, bestower of good to men.  As the sun goes
down over the distant Argolic hills his rays spread a clear pathway
of gold across the waters.  Islands, seas, mountains far and near,
are touched now with shifting hues,--saffron, violet, and rose,--beryl,
topaz, sapphire, amethyst.  There will never be another landscape
like unto this in all the world.  Gladly we sum up our thoughts
in the cry of a son of Athens, Aristophanes, master of song, who
loved her with that love which the land of Athena can ever inspire
in all its children, whether its own by adoption or by birth:--

"OH, THOU, OUR ATHENS!  VIOLET-CROWNED, BRILLIANT, MOST ENVIABLE
OF CITIES!"

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
