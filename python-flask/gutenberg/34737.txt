Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the needle with which to bind
this book. Start in from the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass
the needle and thread through the center of the book, leaving an end
extend outside, then through to the outside, about 2 inches from the
center; then from the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally again through the
center, and tie the two ends in a knot, one each side of the cord on the

                          HOW TO USE THIS BOOK


This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT
MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives
of the Great Composers for Children," "Music Talks with Children,"
"First Studies in Music Biography," and others.

The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the
child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place
throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as
will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to
cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the
corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around
each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.

After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the
book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the
great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous
pages.

The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the
cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's
own book.

This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting
task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to
the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth
while.

          The Story of a Little Boy who was Forced to Practice


Ludwig van Beethoven was born in the lovely town of Bonn, on the River
Rhine, December 16, 1770.

The house in which he spent his boyhood is still standing. We see in the
picture what a pretty, homelike place the house and the yard must have
been. It is now the Beethoven House, or Museum, filled with mementos of
the great composer. There you may see music pages written by him,
letters, medals, instruments; even his ear trumpet is there.

                  [Illustration: THE BEETHOVEN HOUSE]

Beethoven's father was a singer at the Chapel of the Elector. He was not
a good father, for he did not care to work even enough to make his
family comfortable. But the mother loved her boy with all her heart, as
we shall see.

                          [Illustration: No. 3

                          BEETHOVEN'S FATHER]

Ludwig was only four years old when he began to study music. Like
children of to-day he shed many a tear over the first lessons. In the
beginning his father taught him piano and violin, and forced him to
practice. At school he learned, just as we do to-day, reading, writing,
arithmetic, and later on, Latin.

                          [Illustration: No. 4

                           THE FIRST LESSON]

Never again after thirteen, did Ludwig go to school for he had to work
and earn his living.

Do you wonder what kind of a boy he was?

We are told that he was shy and quiet. He talked little and took no
interest in the games that his boy and girl companions played.

While Ludwig was in school he played at a concert for the first time. He
was then eight years old. Two years later he had composed quite a number
of pieces. One of these was printed. It was called _Variations on
Dressler's March_. On the title page of this piece it said:--

                   **********************************
                   * VARIATIONS ON DRESSLER'S MARCH *
                   *  Composed by a Young Amateur   *
                   *      LOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN       *
                   *      Aged ten years. 1780      *
                   **********************************

Then the little boy studied with a teacher named Christian Gottlob
Neefe, who took real interest in him. Neefe did not, as was said of
Beethoven's father, punish the little boy severely to keep him at his
practice, hour after hour.

Often when Neefe had to travel Ludwig took his teacher's place as
organist at the Court. Then with the organ lessons there were other
lessons in Harmony. So rapidly did the boy improve that his teacher said
one day:

"If he goes on as he has begun, he will some day be a second Mozart."

Our young hero of thirteen was surely busy every hour of the day. He
played in an orchestra, as accompanist. He gave lessons, played the
organ in church, studied the violin, and kept up his work in
composition. He always kept a note-book for musical ideas.

Most every child in these days has more and better opportunities than
had the great Beethoven when he was a child. Here is a picture of the
funny old organ in the Minorite Church of Bonn upon which Beethoven
played when he was a little boy.

                          [Illustration: No. 5

                           BEETHOVEN'S ORGAN]

Look at the funny stops at the top and compare it with the best organ in
your own town. This is little better than a toy beside our fine organs
of to-day,--yet it was the best that Beethoven had to practice upon.

When Neefe said that he would probably be a second Mozart the words
filled Ludwig with a great desire. On his sixteenth birthday what do you
think happened? Why, he set out from Bonn to Vienna, where Mozart lived.

But scarcely had he begun to feel at home in Vienna when news came to
him that his mother was ill. She had always been a good mother, kind of
heart, great of hope for her little boy, and probably she sympathized
with the hard lot that made him have to work so early in life. When he
learned of her sickness he hastened to Bonn.

Who was happier, he said to one of his friends, than I, so long as I was
able to speak the sweet name of Mother and know that she heard me?

                          [Illustration: No. 6

                           BEETHOVEN'S MOTHER]

Vienna had given him a wonderful happiness. He met Mozart and had some
lessons from him in composition. When he played for the great master,
Mozart tip-toed from the room and said softly to those present:

"Pay heed to this boy. He will surely make a noise in the world some
day."

                          [Illustration: No. 7

                          BEETHOVEN AND MOZART]

After his Mother's death he determined that he would remain there. And
it was not until he talked with Joseph Haydn, who stopped at Bonn on his
way to London, that he decided once more to journey to Vienna. Beethoven
was twenty-two years old at the time he met Papa Haydn. Beethoven showed
the master some of his compositions. Haydn urged him to go at once to
Vienna, promising to give him lessons in composition on his return from
London.

                             JOSEPH HAYDN]

Everywhere in Vienna Beethoven was a welcome guest. He was proud (but in
the right way), very honest, always straightforward and independent.
But, like his mother, he was warm-hearted and as true as could be. There
was nothing in his nature that was mean, or cruel, or wrong in any way.
He took pride in his talent and worked hard to perfect himself in it.

Here is what Beethoven's handwriting looked like.

                          [Illustration: No. 9

                        BEETHOVEN'S HANDWRITING]

Bit by bit, the great power of Beethoven as a pianist became known. He
played much among his friends, but he did not like to perform in public.

A story is told that once he was to play his C major Concerto at a
concert. When he arrived at the hall he found the piano was tuned so low
that he had to play the Concerto in C# major.

You know how hard it is to transpose a simple piece, but think of
transposing a Concerto and playing it with orchestra without time for
practice!

Do you sometimes wonder what the great composer looked like? Beethoven
lived outside of Vienna and often took long walks in the country. Once a
little boy ten years of age was taken by his father to visit Beethoven.
The boy must have been a very observant boy for he wrote out a
description of how Beethoven looked. This is the little boy's picture as
a man:

                             [Illustration: No. 10

                                  CARL CZERNY]

And this is the description he gave of Beethoven.

"Beethoven was dressed in a dark gray jacket and trousers of some
long-haired material, which reminded me of the description of Robinson
Crusoe I had just been reading. The jet-black hair stood upright on his
head. A beard, unshaven for several days, made still darker his
naturally swarthy face. I noticed also, with a child's quick perception,
that he had cotton wool which seemed to have been dipped in some yellow
fluid in both ears. His hands were covered with hair, and the fingers
were very broad, especially at the tips."

You know, of course, that when we think of music we think of _hearing_
it. We think how it _sounds_ to us. A lover of music loves to hear its
_tones_ and to feel its _rhythm_.

Like every other human being, Beethoven loved music in just this way. He
loved its sounds as they fell on the ear. As colors delight our eyes, so
tones fell with delight upon the ears of this man.

Beethoven was once invited to play at the home of a nobleman, but upon
being informed that he would be expected to go as a menial, he
indignantly rejected the proposal.

                         [Illustration: No. 11

                          THE ANGRY BEETHOVEN]

Beethoven had many friends and was fond of them. They knew that he was a
genius and were glad to forget some of the very strange things that he
did when he got angry. Here is a picture of the great master seated
among a group of his friends. Although Beethoven was odd, his friends
loved him.

                         [Illustration: No. 12

But a strange Fate touched him and took away his sense of hearing. From
the time he was about thirty years old his hearing grew gradually worse.
Indeed it was necessary for him to have a piano especially constructed
with additional wires so that he could hear.

Can you think of anything more cruel, more terrible, more depressing,
more awful?

                       BEETHOVEN IN THE COUNTRY]

And yet he went on day, after day, composing beautiful music as he
walked the fields, or as he sat at his table. For we must remember that
he could hear his own music in his thoughts. That is, the mind that made
the music could hear it, though the ear itself was forever closed to the
sound of it.

Year after year he continued to write symphonies and concertos, sonatas,
songs, choral and chamber music.

And year after year the poor ears closed a little more and still a
little more, until finally not even the loudest noises could penetrate
them.

And yet he worked bravely; writing every beautiful music thought that
came to him, so that the world, and that means you and all of us, might
have them. When Beethoven was dying in 1827, Schubert called upon him
and remained with him for some time.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
